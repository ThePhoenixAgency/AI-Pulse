<p>Surfshark's One plan is still discounted, but you're running out of time if you're going to pick yourself up a subscription.</p><p>It's the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/surfshark">Surfshark</a> plan I always recommend because of its great features. You get antivirus protection, data breach alerts, email scam checks, web content blocking, and a secure search engine. Plus, you can use my favorite Surfshark tool, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/i-spent-a-week-using-an-alternative-identity-and-its-1-flaw-away-from-the-perfect-security-tool">Alternative ID</a>.</p><h2>How to get the best value from Surfshark</h2><p>Despite being a great cheap VPN, there are several steps you should take to ensure you maximise the value you get.</p><p>Most importantly, if you sign up, <strong>turn off auto-renewals</strong>. Surfshark's auto-renewal pricing jumps the cost massively, and there will always be a better VPN deal available — even from Surfshark itself. You can turn this off within your account in a matter of clicks, so make sure you do.</p><p>If you're unsure about signing up, Surfshark gives you more options than most. It offers a <strong>30-day money-back guarantee</strong>, like you'd expect from any VPN, but you also have the choice of a <strong>7-day free trial</strong>.</p><p>The 7-day free trial is a great option if you aren't sure how much you'll use a VPN and don't want to commit money early on. If you know you'll use a VPN but want to make sure Surfshark is right for you, then the money-back guarantee is a welcome backup choice.</p><p>Once you're signed up, make sure you <strong>get Surfshark downloaded on all your devices</strong>. Surfshark's app is available across almost every device, and you have unlimited device connections at your disposal, so why not make use of all of them?</p>

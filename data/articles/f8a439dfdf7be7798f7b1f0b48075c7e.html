There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” he continued.</p><p>Obama’s apparent admission of the existence of aliens was picked up by media outlets globally, and it added fodder to the long-running conspiracy theory claiming that the US government is hiding them at Area 51, a highly classified air force site in Nevada.</p><p>On Sunday evening, Obama said in a post on Instagram that the viral clip did not capture his actual assessment of whether aliens exist, due to the speed of the questions.</p><p>“Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” he stated.</p><p>“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”</p><p>During the podcast episode, Cohen’s next question for the former US leader was: “What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president?”</p><p>Obama responded with a chuckle: “Where are the aliens? Where are the aliens?”</p><p>In 2019, there was an attempt to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/9/19/storm-area-51-possible-crowds-worry-nevada-desert-towns">“storm” Area 51</a>, with 1.5 million people signing up to ambush the once-secret facility. But ultimately, only about 150 social media influencers arrived at the site, and the events that day ended with a few arrests before turning into a music festival.</p><p>In 2013, declassified documents indicated that the site was used for aerial testing of US government projects, including the U-2 and Oxcart aerial surveillance programmes.</p><p>While on Cohen’s podcast, Obama also discussed US President Donald Trump’s recent social media post, which <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/15/clown-show-obama-reacts-to-trump-sharing-racist-monkey-video">depicted him and his wife Michelle as monkeys</a>, Puerto Rican reggaeton artist Bad Bunny’s <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2026/2/9/our-music-can-take-a-stand-latinos-hail-bad-bunnys-super-bowl-show">Super Bowl half-time performance</a>, against which Trump supporters protested, as well as the 2028 election.</p></div></div>

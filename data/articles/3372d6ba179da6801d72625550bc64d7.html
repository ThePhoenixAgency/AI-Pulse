Like a growing number of Tucson residents, she felt compelled to stop and say a prayer alongside the growing array of flowers at the end of her driveway.</p></div><div><p>"Nancy's the same age as my mum, the same height as my mum, and she's got the same hair," Himes tells the BBC. "She lives alone just like my mum does. This is someone who could be anybody's mother."</p></div><div><p>Savannah Guthrie's fame has proved to be a double-edged sword. As well as drawing an unprecedented amount of attention and resources to the search for her mother, it has also inspired feverish speculation and given rise to a string of false leads.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd51/live/d143d290-092c-11f1-9b8e-358033f9eafe.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Camera crews setup near Nancy Guthrie's home, the sky is dark, with with the sun nearly set"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The case has turned the quiet mid-size city of Tucson into a global media spectacle</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Two weeks after Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, investigators revealed they had found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from her home.</p></div><div><p>The sheriff's department also said media reports that a glove had been found inside her home or on the property were inaccurate.</p></div><div><p>To Williams' growing audience, speculation over the case only heightens its intrigue.</p></div><div><p>Since Nancy Guthrie's disappearance, Williams' YouTube channel Dollyvision has gained more than 8,000 new subscribers.</p></div><div><p>Interest in Nancy's disappearance is "massive", he says.</p></div><div><p>"You expect kidnappings to involve cash in a bag dropped off somewhere remote, and then the police turn up and arrest everyone. This is different. This is like a 'new age' of kidnapping."</p></div><div><p>The days of ransom demands made up of letters cut from the pages of a magazine seem a thing of the past.</p></div><div><p>Secure servers, secret IP addresses and untraceable Bitcoin accounts have changed the face of one of the world's oldest crimes - but a former FBI hostage negotiator, Chip Massey, says he believes Nancy Guthrie's kidnappers would soon be caught.</p></div><div><p>Referring to the video images of a masked man on her doorstep shortly before she disappeared, he said somebody, somewhere, would recognise the suspect based either on their behaviour or their body language.</p></div><div><p>"The attention this case has generated is unprecedented," he says, "and while a mask can conceal a face, it can't conceal a person."</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7738/live/3fb23d20-092d-11f1-9b8e-358033f9eafe.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images A banner hung on the gate outside a local NBC affiliate shows a picture of Nancy Guthrie and reads: Bring Her Home"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Savannah Guthrie has repeatedly begged the public for help in finding her mother</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Missing person flyers featuring pictures of Nancy's smiling face, combined with motorway billboards promoting the FBI's tip line have made this case impossible to ignore, even for those who don't watch the news. </p></div><div><p>The White House has said the FBI would be giving the investigation its "full resources".</p></div><div><p>"So many people now seem to be engaged with this search that it is going to very hard for this individual to function," says Massey. </p></div><div><p>"That sort of scrutiny makes it impossible for a suspect to move and creates a sense of the world 'closing in' on them.

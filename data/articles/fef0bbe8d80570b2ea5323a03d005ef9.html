    <div><div><p>A prominent pro-Palestine protester racially and religiously vilified Jewish people when he chanted “All Zionists are terrorists” at a Melbourne rally, a Victorian tribunal has ruled.</p><p>Hash Tayeh, who has flagged an appeal to Thursday’s ruling, was found to have breached the state’s Racial and Religious Tolerance Act with his comments in March last year.</p><p>Menachem Vorchheimer brought the case in the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal (Vcat) as part of a series of applications, including one against former Greens leader Adam Bandt.</p><p>Vorchheimer withdrew his case against Bandt and the party in October last year.</p><p>In his application against Tayeh, Vorchheimer said being labelled a terrorist “for something I have no responsibility for” was “gut-wrenching and soul-destroying”.</p><p>“I felt dehumanised. I felt like the lowest of the low. I no longer feel safe going into the Melbourne CBD given I am identifiably Jewish,” he said.</p><p>“I also generally avoid public gatherings where there [is] a chance of counter protests for fear of being attacked or vilified.”</p><p>The Melbourne man submitted that “Zionists” was used at the rally as a codeword for Jewish people.</p><p>But Tayeh, the founder of burger chain Burgertory, submitted there was no evidence that this was the case, and that protesters had made clear the distinction between Zionists and Jews.</p><p>He said that “Zionists” was used and understood by ordinary rally participants to refer only to supporters of the current regime in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> and the actions of the Israel Defense Forces after 7 October 2023.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p><p>Judge My Anh Tran agreed that “Zionist” did not mean Jew, and found that it was capable of a range of meanings. But Tran found there was likely to have been a very strong association between Zionists and Jewish people in the minds of ordinary rally participants.</p><p>The use of the word “all” by Tayeh strengthened this association, Tran found.</p><p>“I have also found that the use of antisemitic tropes and Holocaust themes at the rally had the tendency to enhance the strength of the association between Zionists and Jewish people.</p><p>“I have also found that the accusation of being a terrorist was one which was inherently likely to incite strong emotions such as hatred and that, if anything, its use in a chant and the rally context enhanced its tendency to do so.”</p><p>Vorchheimer had to establish that ordinary rally participants were incited to experience hatred against Jewish people “on the ground of” their race or religious belief or activity.</p><p>He did not need to prove that Tayeh intended for rally participants to experience this “hatred”, as the motivation only became relevant when considering if the protester had a defence for the comments, Tran said in her ruling.</p><figure></figure><p>The act allowed defences for certain conduct, which would otherwise be considered a breach.</p><p>These defences included if the comments were made while engaged reasonably and in good faith in a matter that was in the public interest, or for a genuine religious or artistic purpose.</p><p>Tayeh claimed that his good faith purpose in initiating the chant was to protest against the actions of the current Israeli regime after 7 October 2023.</p><p>“However, I find the chant was intended by Mr Tayeh to be directed against, at a minimum, all supporters of the continued existence of Israel as a Jewish state,” Tran found, in ruling that Tayeh did not have a defence for the comments.</p><p>“The purpose of the chant thus extended well beyond his claimed purpose of protesting the actions of the current Israeli regime after 7 October.”</p><p>Tran said: “I have concluded that the natural and ordinary effect of thousands of people united in chanting ‘All Zionists are terrorists’ … would be to tip many rally participants over the threshold into hatred directed towards Jewish people.”</p><p>Vorchheimer asked Vcat to make orders preventing Tayeh from engaging in similar conduct in the future; requiring him to publicly acknowledge the ruling and apologise for his actions; and requiring him to pay $20,000 to a charity of Vorchheimer’s choosing.</p><p>Tran will hold a hearing at a later date to decide what consequences, if any, should be imposed.</p><figure></figure></div></div>

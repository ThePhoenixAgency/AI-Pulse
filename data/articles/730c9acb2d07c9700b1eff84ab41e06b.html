  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>Residents of one of India’s most upmarket neighbourhoods say the country’s first “musical road” has turned their daily lives into a nightmare soundtrack.</p><p>A stretch of Mumbai’s recently opened Coastal Road seafront expressway has been engineered to play the pulsating Oscar-winning tune Jai Ho from the movie Slumdog Millionaire when vehicles drive on it at lower speeds.</p><p>Civic officials say the feature is intended to encourage safer driving and is the first of its kind in India.</p><p>Most musical roads worldwide have been built in less populated areas, but Mumbai’s runs past Breach Candy, home to industrialists, Bollywood stars and other high-profile celebrities.</p><p>Residents say the refrain of Jai Ho, which roughly translates from Hindi as “let there be victory”, plays repeatedly from 6am until midnight.</p><p>More than 650 families have signed a formal complaint urging authorities to stop the music, describing it as constant “intrusive background noise” that has caused significant distress.</p><p>The tune “enters homes”, the complaint says, and many households keep their windows shut to block it out.</p><p>Japan pioneered the concept of a musical road <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/13/japan.gadgets">in 2007</a>, and they have since appeared in countries including Hungary, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and the US.</p><figure></figure><p>In Mumbai, India’s financial centre, civic officials pitched the project as a blend of engineering and entertainment and, most importantly, as a safety measure.</p><p>Engineers have carved grooves in the asphalt that act like a giant vinyl record. When vehicles pass over them at between 45 and 50mph (70 and 80km/h), vibrations produce the tune composed by the Indian musician AR Rahman.</p><p>If they drive too fast, the vibrations become uncomfortable, motivating drivers to slow down. Signs alert motorists before the musical stretch, telling them the speed required to experience the tune.</p><p>The 500-metre section was inaugurated on 11 February by the Maharashtra chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, who described it as a “showcase of innovation”.</p><p>Authorities have defended the feature as helping to keep drivers alert while reinforcing speed discipline, but resident do not agree.</p><p>In their complaint to Mumbai’s municipal commissioner and copied to the Maharashtra chief minister’s office, they flag the “auditory distraction on a high-speed road” as a potential safety hazard.</p><p>They also accuse the authorities of focusing on what they see as a speed-control gimmick while failing to address more urgent concerns, such as high-performance cars roaring along Coastal Road at breakneck speed.</p><p>The music is not broadcast through loudspeakers, but residents say its repetitive nature makes it difficult to ignore. At a time when many cities are working to reduce noise pollution, Mumbai is moving in the opposite direction, they argue.</p><p>The eight-lane Coastal Road has been controversial since it was first proposed in 2011. The $1.6bn project has cut the driving time between Marine Drive and Worli from 45 minutes to about 10.</p><p>But critics say the taxpayer-funded motorway, built on land reclaimed from the Arabian Sea, mainly benefits wealthier car owners, while the rest of Mumbai’s 23 million residents have to rely on jam-packed buses and trains.</p></div></div>

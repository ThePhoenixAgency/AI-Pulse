    <div><div><div><h4>In brief</h4><ul>
<li>Predictors on Myriad are bearish on Bitcoin, leaning towards a dump to $55,000 before the top asset pumps.</li>
<li>Bids are rolling in for a massive Pokémon card auction, which predictors think will sell for less than $9 million.</li>
<li>Italy leads all nations in medals won thus far at the Winter Olympics, and predictors like the host country's chances of maintaining its lead over Japan.</li>
</ul></div><p><span>The </span><a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" target="_blank"><span>Crypto Fear and Greed Index</span></a><span> has reached its lowest mark in years as markets continue their prolonged stay in the “Extreme Fear” realm.</span></p><p><span>That fear, which coincides with ranging Bitcoin prices near $65,000 as of Thursday, has not made predictors on Myriad any more bullish this week. Instead, predictors think the next move for the top crypto asset is likely a “dump” to $55,000.</span></p><p><span>Below, we’ll look at some of this week’s top markets on the prediction market platform, including those centered on the next stops for </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer" target="_blank"><span>Bitcoin</span></a><span>, a major Pokémon card sale, and a Winter Olympics duel between Japan and Italy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><i><span>(Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt’s parent company, Dastan.)</span></i></p><h2>Bitcoin’s next move: Pump to $84K or dump to $55K?</h2><p><b>Market Open: </b><span>February 5</span><br><b>Market Close: </b><span>Open until resolution&nbsp;</span><br><b>Volume: </b><span>$12K</span><br><b>Link</b><span>: See the latest odds on the </span><a href="https://myriad.markets/markets/btc-next-move-pump-to-84k-or-dump-to-55k" target="_blank"><span>"BTC's Next Move: Pump to $84K or Dump to $55K?"</span></a><span> market on Myriad</span></p><p><span>Despite rebounding from lows around $60,000, predictors on Myriad are bearish on the top crypto asset’s next stop.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>BTC was recently changing hands below $66,000—down over 2.5% in the last 24 hours but nearly even on the week. However, Bitcoin has plunged 29% over the last month.</span></p><p><span>That’s led to a flip in the odds for Bitcoin’s next stop over the last few days as predictors now favor the dump to $55,000 at 62%, about a 14% swing in the odds since February 7.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s not just the wisdom of the crowds that is saying lower first. A new report from Standard Chartered says that <a href="https://decrypt.co/357858/bitcoin-50k-ethereum-1400-before-rebound-standard-chartered" target="_blank">BTC will find its way to $50,000</a> before it makes a rebound. That matches Galaxy Digital analysis from last week, which suggests Bitcoin will </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/356789/bitcoin-could-drop-below-60k-galaxy-analyst-heres-why" target="_blank"><span>continue to fall towards its 200-week moving average</span></a><span> of $58,000 given its structural weakness and lack of near-term catalysts.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One of those potential catalysts, a Fed rate cut, became increasingly unlikely on Wednesday </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/357789/bitcoin-slides-fed-rate-cut-doubts-strong-jobs-report" target="_blank"><span>following a better-than-expected</span></a><span> jobs report.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>What’s Next? </b><span>Odds of a 25bps rate cut in March have fallen to </span><a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank"><span>under 8% on FedWatch</span></a><span> and just 6% on Polymarket.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Will Logan Paul’s Illustrator Pokémon card sell above $9 million?</h2><p><b>Market Open: </b><span>December 30</span><br><b>Market Close: </b><span>Open until resolution</span><br><b>Volume: </b><span>$39K</span><br><b>Link</b><span>: See the latest odds on the </span><a href="https://myriad.markets/markets/will-logan-paul-s-illustrator-pokemon-card-sell-above-9m" target="_blank"><span>"Will Logan Paul's Pokémon Card Sell for More Than $9M?"</span></a><span> market on Myriad</span></p><p><span>Famed YouTuber and pro wrestler Logan Paul set a record when he purchased a pristine Pikachu Illustrator Pokémon card for nearly $5.3 million in 2021.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Now he’s selling it at auction, and predictors on Myriad are asked whether or not Paul can fetch more than $9 million for the card.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Last month, predictors on Myriad overwhelmingly favored a sale above $9 million, with odds extending as high as 84%. But as bids roll in and the auction conclusion draws closer, predictors have flipped the other way, favoring a sale below $9 million at 58% as of Thursday afternoon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The card, which is the only Pikachu Illustrator to receive a 10 grade, the highest possible mark from Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), </span><a href="https://goldin.co/item/logan-paul-personally-owned-1998-pokemon-japanese-corocoro-promo-raretua0w?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiOGY4NmYwNDdjZmUyMTRiM2M4MTllMmEzMDEzYjYxNWYiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjAsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D" target="_blank"><span>currently maintains a bid of $5.1 million</span></a><span> with just over 3 days remaining in the auction.</span></p></div></div>

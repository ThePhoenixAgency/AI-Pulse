<p>Apple TV has a new Valentine’s Day release, and it leans into romance with a strange, funny twist. ‘Eternity’, a romantic comedy film starring Elizabeth Olsen, Miles Teller, and Callum Turner, is now <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-tvs-eternity-arrives-this-month-starring-elizabeth-olsen/">available to stream</a> on Apple TV after its earlier theatrical run.</p>



<p>The movie sets up its hook fast. After death, people arrive at a place where they must choose their “living arrangement” for the rest of forever. That choice turns personal for Joan (Olsen) because she does not arrive alone in this afterlife.</p>



<p>Joan must decide whether to spend eternity with Larry (Teller), her long-term husband, or Luke (Turner), her first love who died young and has been waiting for her for decades.</p>



<h3>Release details and runtime</h3>



<p>Eternity premieres on Friday, February 13, 2026, on Apple TV.</p>

<h2>Plot</h2>



<p>The afterlife in <strong>Eternity</strong> works like a waiting room with consequences. Everyone gets time to decide where they want to go and who they want to be with. That rule sounds clean until Joan faces a choice that reopens a whole life of memories.</p>



<p>Larry’s decision adds pressure. When he dies, he chooses to wait for Joan instead of moving on right away. Then he learns Luke has already been waiting for her for more than 50 years, holding onto the version of Joan he loved before the rest of her life happened.</p>



<p>That sets up the core tension: Joan is not choosing between two dates. She is choosing between two chapters of herself, and the movie keeps returning to that idea as the love triangle turns into a question about time, loyalty, and regret.</p>



<h2>FAQs</h2>



<p><strong>Is Eternity a series or a movie?</strong><br />It’s a movie, not a series.</p>



<p><strong>Where can you watch Eternity?</strong><br />You can stream it in the Apple TV app with an Apple TV subscription.</p>



<p><strong>Is Eternity a good Valentine’s Day watch?</strong><br />Yes. It mixes romance and comedy, then adds a satire-like afterlife premise that keeps the story moving.</p>



<h2>Apple TV price in the US</h2>



<p>Apple TV costs <strong>$12.99 per month in the United States</strong>, and it includes a <strong>7-day free trial</strong> for new accounts.</p>



<p>If you watch <strong>Eternity</strong> this weekend, you will probably have an opinion fast on who Joan should pick. Tell me which side you land on once you finish it.</p>

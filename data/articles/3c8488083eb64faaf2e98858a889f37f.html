Intel's latest graphics driver brings XeSS Multi-Frame Generation support to even more of its graphics lineup, including Arc discrete GPUs. Pulasthi Ariyasinghe Neowin @LoneWolfSL · Feb 14, 2026 10:16 EST Intel has rolled out a brand-new graphics driver, and it has a pretty major feature for owners of Arc discrete graphics cards as well as a range of Core Ultra CPUs. The latest version of the company's XeSS Frame Generation technology is now available on supported games, letting gamers utilize "Multi-Frame Generation" without using third-party tools. The driver carrying the new tech is the WHQL-certified 32.0.101.8509 release. Intel's Arc B-Series GPUs (Battlemage), A-Series discrete GPUs (Alchemist), and Core Ultra (Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake H) and Core Ultra 2 (Meteor Lake) processors now support the feature in XeSS 3-implemented games. "XeSS Multi-Frame Generation builds upon XeSS Frame Generation by inserting up to 3 generated frames between two rendered frames, going from a 1:1 ratio to 3:1 for an ultra smooth gameplay experience," says the company. The multi-frame generation technology first landed last month, which let Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors with built-in Arc B390 and B370 GPUs (Panther Lake) use the feature. Fixed issues: Intel Core Ultra Series 3 with built-in Intel Arc GPUs: Ghost of Tsushima (DX12) may exhibit color corruption on terrains during gameplay. Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord (DX11) may experience an application crash during game launch. Intel Arc B-Series Graphics Products: Ghost of Tsushima (DX12) may exhibit color corruption on terrains during gameplay. GPU 3D utilization in Task Manager may show inconsistent metrics. Intel Core Ultra Series 2 with built-in Intel Arc GPUs: Ghost of Tsushima (DX12) may exhibit color corruption on terrains during gameplay. GPU 3D utilization in Task Manager may exhibit inconsistent metrics. Known bugs: Intel Core Ultra Series 3 with built-in Intel Arc GPUs: John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando (DX12) may experience an application crash during gameplay. Naraka Bladepoint (DX12) may experience an application crash with Ray Tracing settings enabled. The Finals (DX12) may experience an intermittent application crash. No Man’s Sky (VK) may exhibit corruptions on certain terrains during gameplay. Star Citizen (VK) may experience an application crash on game launch. PUBG: Battlegrounds (DX12) may exhibit intermittent flickers in the game menu. Mafia: The Old Country (DX12) may experience an application crash during gameplay. Topaz Video AI may experience visual artifacts when using certain AI models. Intel Arc B-Series Graphics Products: John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando (DX12) may experience an application crash during gameplay. Recommendation is to use Intel Arc Graphics Driver 32.0.101.8331 or older. Naraka Bladepoint (DX12) may experience an application crash with Ray Tracing settings enabled. Call of Duty Black Ops 6 (DX12) may exhibit intermittent corruptions on certain water surfaces during gameplay. Dune: Awakening (DX12) may exhibit flickering corruptions during gameplay. Star Citizen (VK) may experience an application crash on game launch. PugetBench for Davinci Resolve Studio may experience an intermittent application crash while running the benchmark. Recommendation is to change the timeout slider to 1500 seconds or higher, to wait for each test to complete, in PugetBench* benchmark settings. Intel Arc A-Series Graphics Products: PugetBench for Davinci Resolve Studio may experience an intermittent application crash while running the benchmark. Recommendation is to change the timeout slider to 1500 seconds or higher, to wait for each test to complete, in PugetBench* benchmark settings. Intel Core Ultra Series 1 with built-in Intel Arc GPUs: Battlefield 6 (DX12) may exhibit intermittent corruptions on certain maps during gameplay. Intel Core Ultra Series 2 with built-in Intel Arc GPUs: John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando (DX12) may experience an application crash during gameplay. Recommendation is to use Intel Arc Graphics Driver 32.0.101.8331 or older. Call of Duty Black Ops 6 (DX12) may exhibit intermittent corruptions on certain water surfaces during gameplay. Battlefield 6 (DX12) may exhibit intermittent corruptions on certain maps during gameplay on some notebooks with Intel Core Ultra Series 2 with built-in Intel Arc GPUs. No Man’s Sky (VK) may exhibit corruptions on certain terrains during gameplay. Topaz Video AI may experience visual artifacts when using certain AI models. The new WHQL-certified Intel graphics driver version 32.0.101.8509 is now available for download from Intel. Here's its official changelog (PDF).</code></pre>

    <div><div> <p>Traditional prayers, fireworks and fairs marked the Lunar <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/new-year/" target="_self">New Year</a> on Tuesday – alongside 21st-century humanoid robots.</p> <p>The activities ushered in the Year of the Horse, one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, succeeding the Year of the Snake.</p> <p>Thousands of people in <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/beijing/" target="_self">Beijing</a> jammed into the former Temple of Earth to buy snacks, toys and trinkets from stalls. Sun Jing, who brought her parents to the capital for the holiday, said the atmosphere was as lively as in her childhood.</p> <p>"I haven’t felt such a strong sense of Lunar New Year festivity in a very, very long time,” she said.</p> <p>Crowds descended on popular temples to burn incense and pray for happiness and success in the coming year. The Lunar New Year is the most important annual holiday in China and some other East Asian nations and is celebrated outside the region, too.</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a740eab8-0c25-11f1-bda1-005056a97e36/w:980/AP26044387257879.jpg" alt="Humanoid robots perform in front of a festive backdrop during a media preview of a robotic temple fair ahead of Lunar New Year in Beijing, China, February 13, 2026"> <figcaption> <span>Humanoid robots perform in front of a festive backdrop during a media preview of a robotic temple fair ahead of Lunar New Year in Beijing, China, February 13, 2026.</span> <span> Vincent Thian, AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>As every year, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/china/" target="_self">China</a> celebrated the Lunar New Year with a TV show and once again the humanoid robots were a central part of the performance Monday night.</p> <p>One of the highlights of the CCTV Spring Festival gala was a <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/martial-arts/" target="_self">martial arts</a> performance by children and robots. For several minutes, humanoids from Unitree Robotics showed different sequences and even brandished swords.</p> <p>The performance showed China’s push to develop more advanced robots powered by improved <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/artificial-intelligence/" target="_self">AI</a> capabilities.</p> <p>Viewers applauded the robots, with one saying they give good guidance and direction for young people. One man, though, said that while China's advances in robotics are great, they detracted from his experience.</p> <p>“It lacks a bit of the New Year atmosphere,” Li Bo said. "It’s not as enjoyable as when I was little watching the gala.”</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/41d62344-0c22-11f1-8667-005056bf30b7/w:980/AP26047587773041.jpg" alt="Actor Lana Wong Wai Lin, center, and other worshippers burn incense at Wong Tai Sin Temple to welcome the Lunar New Year of the Horse in Hong Kong, February 16, 2026"> <figcaption> <span>Actor Lana Wong Wai Lin, center, and other worshippers burn incense at Wong Tai Sin Temple to welcome the Lunar New Year of the Horse in Hong Kong, February 16, 2026.</span> <span> Chan Long Hei, AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Incense smoke wafted into the air at a temple in <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/hong-kong/" target="_self">Hong Kong</a> where people line up every year to make wishes for the new year at midnight.</p> <p>Holding up a cluster of incense sticks, many bowed their heads several times before planting the sticks in containers placed in front of a temple hall.</p> <p>Entertainers in <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/vietnam/" target="_self">Vietnam</a> sang at an outdoor countdown event before multiple fireworks shows at several cities in the Southeast Asian nation, where the festival is called Tet.</p> <p>Light shows lit up bridges and skyscrapers as the fireworks went off and crowds clapped in rhythm to live pop music performances.</p> <p>People sampled Chinese cuisine from stalls and strolled along snowy streets decorated with red lanterns and dragons as two weeks of events got underway Monday at various venues in the Russian capital.</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8476704c-0c26-11f1-b30f-005056a90284/w:980/2026-02-16T163150Z-984609917-RC23NJA0ZYMJ-RTRMADP-3-LUNAR-NEWYEAR-RUSSIA.jpg" alt="Spokeswoman of Russia's Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova and China's Ambassador to Russia Zhang Hanhui attend the Lunar New Year festival showcasing traditional Chinese culture, arts and performances"> <figcaption> <span>Spokeswoman of Russia's Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova and China's Ambassador to Russia Zhang Hanhui attend the Lunar New Year festival showcasing traditional Chinese culture, arts and performances in central Moscow, Russia, February 16, 2026.</span> <span> Ramil Sitdikov, Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>The third annual Lunar New Year celebration comes at time of <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20260204-xi-putin-hail-stabilising-china-russia-alliance" target="_self">warming relations between China and Russia</a>&nbsp;– ties that have frustrated many European governments because of the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>The solemn peal of a temple bell rang out 108 times&nbsp;– an auspicious number&nbsp;– as people flocked to the Baoan Temple in Taipei on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>They lit incense sticks, bowed their heads and left offerings of colorful flower bouquets on outdoor tables on the temple grounds in <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/taiwan/" target="_self">Taiwan</a>'s capital city.</p> <p>Thousands of Argentines gathered in Buenos Aires’s Chinatown to celebrate the Lunar New Year and enjoyed dragon and lion dances on the main stage, alongside <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/martial-arts/" target="_self">martial arts</a> demonstrations.</p> <p>The Chinese immigrant community is among Argentina's most dynamic, accounting for more than 180,000 people in the South American country.</p> <div> <p>What is 'The Bright Side'?</p> <p>For those tired of anxiety-inducing news, <a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/the-bright-side/">The Bright Side</a> highlights initiatives, new discoveries and lighter perspectives to showcase progress and positivity in the world.

This resulted in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield falling to 4.05%, the lowest since early December. Bitcoin rallied, rising from nearly $66,800 on friday to over $70,000 over the weekend, but failed to establish a foothold there.</p><p>Vikram Subburaj, CEO of the India-based <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest/2026-list-of-fiu-registered-crypto-exchange-in-india/articleshow/126953319.cms?from=mdr" target="_blank">regulated</a> Giottus exchange, said selective demand is the reason why rallies struggle to hold. </p><p>"Risk appetite stayed selective and macro cross-currents kept traders defensive. In derivatives, the market continues to behave as if it is ‘de-leveraging first, asking questions later.’ Rallies have struggled to hold and dips are being bought only selectively near obvious levels," he said in an email to CoinDesk. </p><h2>Macro heavy weak</h2><p>A packed week of macro data lies ahead, with traders eyeing the minutes of the January Fed meeting and the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE), for fresh positioning signals. </p><p>"PCE inflation, the Fed’s preferred measure, will be closely monitored for confirmation that price pressures are moderating, particularly after CPI showed only gradual disinflation and inflation remains above the 2% target," Dessislava Ianeva, Nexo dispatch analyst, said in an email. </p><p>"Markets will assess both the monthly momentum and year-on-year trend for implications for the policy path." Ianeva added. </p><p>In traditional markets, Mark Nash of Jupiter Asset Management, a high-profile yen bear has flipped bullish, forecasting 8–9% yen appreciation, particularly against the Swiss franc. </p><p>The yen and bitcoin have hit a record positive correlation in recent months, which makes any yen strength a key catalyst for bitcoin bulls.</p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>Hive, Riot earnings reports, Fed rate-decision minutes: Crypto Week Ahead</p><div><p>57 minutes ago</p></div><figure><img alt="Federal Reserve logo highlighted on a U.S. banknote (joshua-hoehne/Unsplash/Modified by CoinDesk)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2Faa140510763159a9c00f0230ff84f4f675e733d6-1920x1080.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" /></figure><p>Your look at what's coming in the week starting Feb. 16.</p><div><p>What to know: </p><div><p>You are reading Crypto Week Ahead: a comprehensive list of what's coming up in the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain in the coming days, as well as the major macroeconomic events that will influence digital asset markets.

</ul></article><article><header><h2>What to know about the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan</h2></header><p>The two countries share a 1,600-mile long frontier known as the <strong>Durand Line</strong>, named after the British diplomat Mortimer Durand and established in 1893. It cuts through the heartland of the tribal areas of the Pashtun, the largest ethnic group in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and where most of the Taliban hails from.</p><p>It is this line that is the root cause of the tensions between the neighbouring countries. Although it is <strong>internationally recognised as Pakistan’s western border,</strong> Afghanistan <strong>does not accept it as a legitimate boundary.</strong></p><p>Both Pakistan and Afghanistan accuse each other for <strong>failing to tackle the militant activity along the border.</strong></p></article><article><header></header><p>The Taliban government spokesperson, <strong>Zabihullah Mujahid, </strong>argued that Pakistan’s security problems were an internal matter, a statement <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> has repeatedly made but rejected by Islamabad.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AlemarahDari/status/2027349049385636281">statement</a> during a press conference today, Mujahid said:</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markPakistan’s internal conflict <strong>is entirely a matter for that country and is not a new issue.</strong> A war has been ongoing for about twenty years between Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Pakistani army. In 2007, the TTP declared itself in Pakistan’s tribal areas, after which Pakistan conducted successive military operations there, the largest of which was “Operation Zarb-e-Azb”, which began in 2014.</p> <p>The Islamic Emirate has been in control of Afghanistan for about four years; therefore, <strong>it is not at all reasonable for Pakistan to now burden Afghanistan with its old, internal problem.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>In case you don’t know what the TTP is, I explain it in an earlier post <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2026/feb/27/pakistan-afghanistan-taliban-war-cross-border-kabul-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-69a1694f8f0807e27ff0a74d#block-69a1694f8f0807e27ff0a74d">here</a>.</p></article><article><header><h2>Operation continuing on the directions of PM, says Pakistan army</h2></header><p>Pakistan’s military operation against the Taliban government in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> is continuing on the directions of the prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, a Pakistani army spokesperson was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.</p></article><article><header><h2>Pakistani army claims 274 Taliban fighters killed</h2></header><p><strong>Chaudhry </strong>claimed at least <strong>274 Taliban fighters were killed and more than 400 injured</strong> since the Pakistani armed forces launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq.</p><p>He described the Afghan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban">Taliban</a> regime as an “internationally recognised terrorist organisation” responsible for last night’s clashes.</p><p>“This aggression was done by this master proxy in coordination, in collusion and in support of a terrorist organisation,” he was quoted as saying by <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pak-afghan-clashes">local media</a>.</p><p>“That’s what happened last night.”</p></article><article><header><h2>Dozen soldiers killed in Pakistan, army spokesperson says</h2></header><p><strong>Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry</strong>, the spokesperson for Pakistan’s armed forces, is holding a press conference providing updates of the cross-border fighting with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.</p><p>He said <strong>12 Pakistani soldiers were killed and</strong> <strong>27 wounded</strong>, according to <a href="https://www.dawn.com/live/pak-afghan-clashes">local media reports</a> of the press briefing.</p><p>Other updates he shared include:</p><ul> <li> <p><strong>Pakistani forces targeted strikes at 22 locations across Afghanistan, </strong>including in Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia, Nangarhar, Khost and Paktika.</p></li> <li> <p>The targets<strong> </strong>included <strong>“core headquarters of Afghan Taliban forces… ammunition depots, logistic bases, and refuges that provide shelter to terrorists and facilitators”.</strong></p></li> <li> <p>Pakistan armed forces had <strong>destroyed 73 posts and had captured 17.</strong></p></li> <li> <p>An estimated <strong>115 tanks, armoured personnel carriers and artillery pieces were destroyed.</strong></p></li>

After that, we heard explosions,” he said.</p><p>“Everyone, in panic, ran down from the second floor of the house.

To that end, the TTP has worked to destabilise Pakistan by directly attacking its army and assassinating politicians.</p><p>The TTP is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban">Taliban</a>, which returned to power in 2021.</p><p>Pakistan has long accused Afghanistan of harbouring militants that carry out attacks across the border, which the Afghan Taliban denies.</p></article><article><header><h2>Afghanistan claims its drones hit Pakistan targets</h2></header><p>Both countries have shared conflicting statements about the reported drones strikes launched by the Taliban against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan">Pakistan</a>.</p><p>The Taliban in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> “successfully conducted” airstrikes using drones to hit military targets in Pakistan, its defence ministry and a government spokesperson said.</p><p>Pakistani information minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistani <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban">Taliban</a> militants had tried to use drones against targets in Pakistan but they were brought down by anti-drone systems and there was “no damage to life”.</p><p>The reports could not be independently verified.</p></article><article><header></header><p>Pakistan state broadcaster PTV reported this morning that Islamabad jets were patrolling the skies above Afghanistan’s <strong>Kandahar</strong> after launching airstrikes against Taliban targets.</p><p>“The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan">Pakistan</a> armed forces are fully prepared for any aggression and possess the capability to deliver a befitting response,” the broadcaster quoted security sources as saying.</p><p>Pakistani security sources said they destroyed an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban">Taliban</a> ammunition depot in Kandahar, according to local reports.</p></article><article><header></header><p>UN human rights chief <strong>Volker Turk</strong> has also urged for “urgent political dialogue” to end the fighting, as he expressed concern over the “sharp increase in civilian casualties”.</p><p>“This situation calls for urgent political dialogue, rather than escalating the use of force,” Turk <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2026/02/1167040">said</a>.</p></article><article><header><h2>Countries call for calm and restraint</h2></header><p><strong>Saudi Arabia </strong>and Pakistan’s foreign ministers spoke today to discuss reducing tensions, according to Riyadh’s foreign office. Both countries have longstanding defence, diplomatic and economic ties, but it is unclear if Saudi Arabia is involved in brokering a ceasefire.</p><p><strong>Russia</strong>, the only country to formally recognise the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban">Taliban</a> government, called on both sides to return to the negotiating table “to resolve all differences through political and diplomatic means”.</p><p>“We call on our friends <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and Pakistan to refrain from dangerous confrontation,” said Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.</p><p><strong>China’s</strong> foreign ministry said it had been mediating in the conflict through its own channels and was “deeply concerned” about the escalation. Pakistan is one of China’s closest partners in the region, but it considers itself a “friendly neighbour” of Afghanistan.</p><p>China “calls on both sides to remain calm and exercise restraint … achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, and avoid further bloodshed”, said foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning.</p></article><article><header></header><p>There has been no reaction from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> to Asif’s comments on “open war”. The Taliban government said Afghan forces attacked Pakistani border troops last night <strong>in retaliation for earlier airstrikes by Islamabad.</strong></p><p>“In response to the repeated rebellions and insurrections of the Pakistani military, large-scale offensive operations were launched against Pakistani military bases and military installations along the Durand Line,” Afghanistan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said on X, referring to the 1,600-mile long border between the two countries.</p><p>Afghan authorities in the eastern Nangarhar province said that <strong>fighting was ongoing in the Torkham border area</strong> this morning, according to the AP news agency.</p><p>There are conflicting reports on the number of casualties sustained on both sides. Afghanistan claimed 55 Pakistani soldiers were killed and “several others were captured alive”, while eight of its own fighters died. Pakistan reported that 133 Afghan fighters and two of its own soldiers were killed, but denied that any were captured.</p><p>The escalation comes after Qatar and Turkey mediated a <strong>ceasefire between the two countries in October, </strong>when<strong> </strong>deadly border clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants. Several rounds of negotiations have since taken place but to no avail.</p></article><article><header><h2>Opening summary</h2></header><p>Morning, Taz Ali here to bring you the latest developments in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border clashes.</p><p><strong>Pakistan has declared an “open war” against neighbouring Afghanistan</strong> after both sides traded <strong>deadly tit-for-tat cross-border fire last night</strong> with explosions reported in Kabul and other major Afghan cities.</p><p>Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq (roughly translated as “Righteous Fury”) against the Afghan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taliban">Taliban</a> <strong>in response to what it called “unprovoked firing” in multiple locations across the border</strong>. According to local reports, Pakistani forces <strong>launched airstrikes against military targets in the Afghan capital, Kabul</strong>, as well as in Kandahar and Paktia provinces close to the border.</p><p><strong>“Our patience has now run out. Now it is open war between us,”</strong> Khawaja Mohammad Asif, the Pakistani defence minister, wrote on X.</p><figure><div><img alt="Taliban soldiers load a rocket launcher in a vehicle." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd45fb83a6ab75c44af0dc64759eed4fcf02de01/0_0_3407_2310/master/3407.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Taliban soldiers load a rocket launcher in a vehicle, following exchanges of fire between Pakistan and Afghanistan forces, near Torkham border in Afghanistan.</span> Photograph: Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>Read our full report on this story here:</p><figure></figure></article></div></div>

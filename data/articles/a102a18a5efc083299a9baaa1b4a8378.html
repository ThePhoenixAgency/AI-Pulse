  <div class="content">
    <p><p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a> released <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Cowork</a> on Monday, a new AI agent capability that extends the power of its wildly successful <a href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> tool to non-technical users — and according to company insiders, the team built the entire feature in approximately a week and a half, largely using Claude Code itself.</p><p>The launch marks a major inflection point in the race to deliver practical AI agents to mainstream users, positioning Anthropic to compete not just with <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">Google</a> in conversational AI, but with <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">Microsoft&#x27;s Copilot</a> in the burgeoning market for AI-powered productivity tools.</p><p>&quot;Cowork lets you complete non-technical tasks much like how developers use Claude Code,&quot; the <a href="https://x.com/claudeai/status/2010805682434666759?s=20">company announced</a> via its official Claude account on X. The feature arrives as a research preview available exclusively to <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11014257-about-claude-s-max-plan-usage">Claude Max subscribers</a> — Anthropic&#x27;s power-user tier priced between $100 and $200 per month — through the macOS desktop application.</p><p>For the past year, the industry narrative has focused on large language models that can write poetry or debug code. With <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Cowork</a>, Anthropic is betting that the real enterprise value lies in an AI that can open a folder, read a messy pile of receipts, and generate a structured expense report without human hand-holding.</p><div></div><h2><b>How developers using a coding tool for vacation research inspired Anthropic&#x27;s latest product</b></h2><p>The genesis of <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Cowork</a> lies in Anthropic&#x27;s recent success with the developer community. In late 2024, the company released <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet">Claude Code</a>, a terminal-based tool that allowed software engineers to automate rote programming tasks. The tool was a hit, but Anthropic noticed a peculiar trend: users were forcing the coding tool to perform non-coding labor.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/bcherny/status/2010809450844831752">Boris Cherny</a>, an engineer at Anthropic, the company observed users deploying the developer tool for an unexpectedly diverse array of tasks.</p><div></div><p>&quot;Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven,&quot; Cherny wrote on X. &quot;These use cases are diverse and surprising — the reason is that the underlying Claude Agent is the best agent, and Opus 4.5 is the best model.&quot;</p><p>Recognizing this shadow usage, Anthropic effectively stripped the command-line complexity from their developer tool to create a consumer-friendly interface. In its blog post announcing the feature, <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Anthropic explained</a> that developers &quot;quickly began using it for almost everything else,&quot; which &quot;prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude in the very same way.&quot;</p><h2><b>Inside the folder-based architecture that lets Claude read, edit, and create files on your computer</b></h2><p>Unlike a standard chat interface where a user pastes text for analysis, <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Cowork</a> requires a different level of trust and access. Users designate a specific folder on their local machine that Claude can access. Within that sandbox, the AI agent can read existing files, modify them, or create entirely new ones.</p><p>Anthropic offers several illustrative examples: reorganizing a cluttered downloads folder by sorting and intelligently renaming each file, generating a spreadsheet of expenses from a collection of receipt screenshots, or drafting a report from scattered notes across multiple documents.</p><p>&quot;In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder,&quot; <a href="https://x.com/claudeai/status/2010805685530038351">the company explained</a> on X. &quot;Try it to create a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft from scattered notes.&quot;</p><div></div><p>The architecture relies on what is known as an &quot;agentic loop.&quot; When a user assigns a task, the AI does not merely generate a text response. Instead, it formulates a plan, executes steps in parallel, checks its own work, and asks for clarification if it hits a roadblock. Users can queue multiple tasks and let Claude process them simultaneously — a workflow Anthropic describes as feeling &quot;much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker.&quot;</p><p>The system is built on Anthropic&#x27;s <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk">Claude Agent SDK</a>, meaning it shares the same underlying architecture as Claude Code. Anthropic notes that Cowork &quot;can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks.&quot;</p><h2><b>The recursive loop where AI builds AI: Claude Code reportedly wrote much of Claude Cowork</b></h2><p>Perhaps the most remarkable detail surrounding Cowork&#x27;s launch is the speed at which the tool was reportedly built — highlighting a recursive feedback loop where AI tools are being used to build better AI tools.</p><p>During a livestream hosted by Dan Shipper, Felix Rieseberg, an Anthropic employee, confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/blakeir/status/2010837251505205656">t</a>he team <a href="https://x.com/blakeir/status/2010837251505205656">built Cowork in approximately a week and a half</a>.</p><p>Alex Volkov, who covers AI developments, expressed surprise at the timeline: &quot;Holy shit Anthropic built &#x27;Cowork&#x27; in the last... week and a half?!&quot;</p><div></div><p>This prompted immediate speculation about how much of Cowork was itself built by Claude Code. <a href="https://x.com/_simonsmith">Simon Smith</a>, EVP of Generative AI at Klick Health, put it bluntly on X: &quot;Claude Code wrote all of Claude Cowork. Can we all agree that we&#x27;re in at least somewhat of a recursive improvement loop here?&quot;</p><p>The implication is profound: Anthropic&#x27;s AI coding agent may have substantially contributed to building its own non-technical sibling product. If true, this is one of the most visible examples yet of AI systems being used to accelerate their own development and expansion — a strategy that could widen the gap between AI labs that successfully deploy their own agents internally and those that do not.</p><h2><b>Connectors, browser automation, and skills extend Cowork&#x27;s reach beyond the local file system</b></h2><p>Cowork doesn&#x27;t operate in isolation. The feature integrates with Anthropic&#x27;s existing ecosystem of connectors — tools that link <a href="https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2Fnew%3F">Claude</a> to external information sources and services such as <a href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.com/">Notion</a>, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/home">PayPal</a>, and other supported partners. Users who have configured these connections in the standard Claude interface can leverage them within Cowork sessions.</p><p>Additionally, Cowork can pair with <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome">Claude in Chrome</a>, Anthropic&#x27;s browser extension, to execute tasks requiring web access. This combination allows the agent to navigate websites, click buttons, fill forms, and extract information from the internet — all while operating from the desktop application.</p><p>&quot;Cowork includes a number of novel UX and safety features that we think make the product really special,&quot; <a href="https://x.com/bcherny/status/2010809450844831752">Cherny explained</a>, highlighting &quot;a built-in VM [virtual machine] for isolation, out of the box support for browser automation, support for all your claude.ai data connectors, asking you for clarification when it&#x27;s unsure.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a> has also introduced an initial set of &quot;skills&quot; specifically designed for Cowork that enhance Claude&#x27;s ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. These build on the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills">Skills for Claude</a> framework the company announced in October, which provides specialized instruction sets Claude can load for particular types of tasks.</p><h2><b>Why Anthropic is warning users that its own AI agent could delete their files</b></h2><p>The transition from a chatbot that suggests edits to an agent that makes edits introduces significant risk. An AI that can organize files can, theoretically, delete them.</p><p>In a notable display of transparency, Anthropic devoted considerable space in its announcement to <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">warning users about Cowork&#x27;s potential dangers</a> — an unusual approach for a product launch.</p><p>The company explicitly acknowledges that Claude &quot;can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it&#x27;s instructed to.&quot; Because Claude might occasionally misinterpret instructions, Anthropic urges users to provide &quot;very clear guidance&quot; about sensitive operations.</p><p>More concerning is the risk of prompt injection attacks — a technique where malicious actors embed hidden instructions in content Claude might encounter online, potentially causing the agent to bypass safeguards or take harmful actions.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ve built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections,&quot; Anthropic wrote, &quot;but agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude&#x27;s real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry.&quot;</p><p>The company characterized these risks as inherent to the current state of AI agent technology rather than unique to Cowork. &quot;These risks aren&#x27;t new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you&#x27;re using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation,&quot; the announcement notes.</p><h2><b>Anthropic&#x27;s desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft Copilot</b></h2><p>The launch of <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Cowork</a> places Anthropic in direct competition with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a>, which has spent years attempting to integrate its <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">Copilot AI</a> into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.</p><p>However, Anthropic&#x27;s approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application.</p><p>What distinguishes Anthropic&#x27;s approach is its bottom-up evolution. Rather than designing an AI assistant and retrofitting agent capabilities, Anthropic built a powerful coding agent first — <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview">Claude Code</a> — and is now abstracting its capabilities for broader audiences. This technical lineage may give Cowork more robust agentic behavior from the start.</p><p>Claude Code has generated significant enthusiasm among developers since its initial launch as <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet">a command-line tool in late 2024</a>. The company expanded access with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/claude-code-gets-a-web-version-but-its-the-new-sandboxing-that-really-matters/">web interface</a> in October 2025, followed by a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropics-claude-code-can-now-read-your-slack-messages-and-write-code-for">Slack integration</a> in December. Cowork is the next logical step: bringing the same agentic architecture to users who may never touch a terminal.</p><h2><b>Who can access Cowork now, and what&#x27;s coming next for Windows and other platforms</b></h2><p>For now, Cowork remains exclusive to <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11014257-about-claude-s-max-plan-usage">Claude Max subscribers</a> using the macOS desktop application. Users on other subscription tiers — Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise — can join a waitlist for future access.</p><p>Anthropic has signaled clear intentions to expand the feature&#x27;s reach. The blog post explicitly mentions plans to add cross-device sync and bring Cowork to Windows as the company learns from the research preview.</p><p>Cherny set expectations appropriately, describing the product as &quot;early and raw, similar to what Claude Code felt like when it first launched.&quot;</p><p>To access <a href="https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview">Cowork</a>, Max subscribers can download or update the Claude macOS app and click on &quot;Cowork&quot; in the sidebar.</p><h2><b>The real question facing enterprise AI adoption</b></h2><p>For technical decision-makers, the implications of Cowork extend beyond any single product launch. The bottleneck for AI adoption is shifting — no longer is model intelligence the limiting factor, but rather workflow integration and user trust.</p><p>Anthropic&#x27;s goal, as the company puts it, is to make working with Claude feel less like operating a tool and more like delegating to a colleague. Whether mainstream users are ready to hand over folder access to an AI that might misinterpret their instructions remains an open question.</p><p>But the speed of Cowork&#x27;s development — a major feature built in ten days, possibly by the company&#x27;s own AI — previews a future where the capabilities of these systems compound faster than organizations can evaluate them. </p><p>The chatbot has learned to use a file manager. What it learns to use next is anyone&#x27;s guess.</p></p>

						<p>Antivirus Survivors 2003 Professional takes the idea of Vampire Survivors and everything similar, and turns you into a mouse cursor inside an infected PC. With a retro Windows style, it's actually quite funny what the developer has done with it.</p>
<p>How it works: you're fighting through folders, each with corruption that can harm you if you move the cursor through it and various types of viruses and adware floating around trying to take you down. There's various difficulty levels, different cursors to unlock with their own bonuses and then you pick your starting weapon. Even your weapons are funny like a bouncing DVD logo, a firewall that creates rings of fire, a pinball, hard drives that drop onto enemies and more.</p>
<p>During the folder battle you'll go around enabling various programs like "vapour.exe" (that looks like the Steam logo) which destroys everything, LemWire (a play on the classic LimeWire) which downloads you new upgrades, there's a keygen program to allow you to unlock certain other programs and more. There's even a key generator program you can find, .dll files that throw up error messages and more. </p>
<p>There's also a new demo launch trailer:</p>

<p>Pretty amusing! A fun play on the survivor-like bullet heaven genre. My main concern with the gameplay is that it feels just a bit too <em>slow</em>, but other than that I really love the setting for this. It's stupid, but the right kind of stupid to be entertaining.</p>

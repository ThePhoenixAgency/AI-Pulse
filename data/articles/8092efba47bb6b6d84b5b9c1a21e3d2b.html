  <div class="content"><p>(Image credit: Future/Rob Dwiar) The PlayStation Portal is my favorite PS5 accessory; I simply couldn't imagine my gaming life without it now.Despite it technically being an accessory itself, you can still equip the handheld with a range of other bits and bobs in its own right to really accentuate the experience. And boy, have I done my best to do exactly that over the years.From earbuds to grips, and from carry cases to chargers, there's a bunch I can recommend from personal testing and ownership. I've even made the most of some PS5 and Nintendo Switch accessories on the Portal — see the controller and thumb grips below — so I have a strong grasp on what works and what doesn't.While the wider Presidents' Day sales rumble on, these are still worth considering if you're looking to enhance your Portal experience. Plus, I've also included some extra accessories that I'm personally eyeing up too — you can never have too many.Chosen byChosen byEver since I reviewed the PlayStation Portal back just before its launch in late 2023, it's been an integral part of my PS5 setup. I couldn't live without it, and it comes on almost every trip I go on, and I use it at least several times a week, regardless of where I am. Also, in those two-plus years, I've built out my Portal setup, too, and have added a bunch of accessories that help me enjoy it even more.6 of my favorite PlayStation portal accessories......and 3 I'm eyeing up nextFollow TechRadar on Google News and add us as a preferred source to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

<div> <p>The PlayStation Portal is my favorite PS5 accessory; I simply couldn't imagine my gaming life without it now.</p><p>Despite it technically being an accessory itself, you can still equip the handheld with a range of other bits and bobs in its own right to really accentuate the experience. And boy, have I done my best to do exactly that over the years.</p><p>From earbuds to grips, and from carry cases to chargers, there's a bunch I can recommend from personal testing and ownership. I've even made the most of some PS5 and Nintendo Switch accessories on the Portal — see the controller and thumb grips below — so I have a strong grasp on what works and what doesn't.</p><p>While the wider <a href="https://www.techradar.com/live/news/presidents-day-sale-live-2026">Presidents' Day sales</a> rumble on, these are still worth considering if you're looking to enhance your Portal experience. Plus, I've also included some extra accessories that I'm personally eyeing up too — you can never have too many.</p><div><p><span>Chosen by</span></p><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xzLvmTAxDomnqnHMVyQsZN.jpg" alt="A headshot of TechRadar Gaming managing editor Rob Dwiar"></div></figure></div><div><p><span>Chosen by</span></p></div><p>Ever since I reviewed the PlayStation Portal back just before its launch in late 2023, it's been an integral part of my PS5 setup. I couldn't live without it, and it comes on almost every trip I go on, and I use it at least several times a week, regardless of where I am. Also, in those two-plus years, I've built out my Portal setup, too, and have added a bunch of accessories that help me enjoy it even more.</p></div><h3><span>6 of my favorite PlayStation portal accessories...</span></h3><h3><span>...and 3 I'm eyeing up next</span></h3><hr><p><em></em><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

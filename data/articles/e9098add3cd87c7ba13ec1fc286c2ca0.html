<p>Ahead of the streaming of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/getappletvplus">Formula 1 on Apple TV</a>, Apple has been working with various teams to promote their new cars in Shot on iPhone campaigns. As pictured above, this includes a partnership with F1 newcomer Cadillac …</p>



<p>Using the iconic Shot on iPhone format, Apple is featuring various shots from testing taken on iPhone 17 Pro of the Cadillac car and drivers in the garage. </p>



<p>The partnerships expand beyond just one team. Apple collaborated with Red Bull to include Shot on iPhone campaign for their car launch, as well as a demo of some of the new engine parts through an Apple Vision Pro stage experience. </p>



<p>Based on the number of iPhone 17 Pros hanging around the paddock during testing this week, there are probably more to come as well.</p>



<p>It’s unclear if these are separate promotion deals Apple has struck with the teams individually, or if part of the overall Apple-F1 streaming deal included promo commitment guarantees with the teams.</p>



<p>As a reminder, if you are in the United States, Apple TV is now the exclusive broadcaster of Formula 1. This means all Grand Prix races, qualifying and practice sessions will stream through the Apple TV app for Apple TV subscribers, beginning with the first race weekend on March 7.</p>



<p>Apple TV subscribers also get access to F1.TV included as a free perk, so hardcore fans can carry on using the same customized app experiences they are used to. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/04/f1-tv-free-with-apple-tv-link-subscription/">You can link your account</a> right now to watch the final round of testing sessions taking place next week.</p>

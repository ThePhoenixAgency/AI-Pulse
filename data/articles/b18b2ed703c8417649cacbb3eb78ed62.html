    <div><div><h2>The asset manager overseeing more than $900 billion assets may buy up to 90 million MORPHO tokens as part of a partnership to support DeFi credit market, it said.</h2><p><span> Feb 15, 2026, 8:59 p.m. </span></p></div><div><p>Apollo Global Management (APO) is moving deeper into crypto, striking a deal that could make the $938 billion asset manager a major token holder in a decentralized lending platform.</p><p>The firm signed a <a href="https://morpho.org/blog/morpho-association-announces-cooperation-agreement-with-apollo/" target="_blank">cooperation agreement</a> with the Morpho Association, the French non-profit organization behind the Morpho protocol, that allows Apollo and its affiliates to buy up 90 million tokens <span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/morpho"><span><span><span>MORPHO</span><span></span><span>$1.3939</span></span></span></a></span> tokens over the next four years. </p><div><p><span>STORY CONTINUES BELOW</span></p></div><p>The purchases may take place through open-market buys, over-the-counter transactions and other arrangements, and are subject to ownership caps and transfer restrictions. Galaxy Digital UK acted as exclusive financial adviser to Morpho, according to the document.</p><p>Beyond the token purchases, Apollo and Morpho said they will work together to support lending markets built on Morpho’s protocol. Morpho provides infrastructure for onchain lending markets and curator-managed vaults that allocate assets across them. The protocol is governed by holders of the MORPHO token. The 90 million token stake would translate to 9% of the protocol's governance token's total supply.</p><p>The agreement adds to Apollo’s expanding blockchain footprint. Last year, the firm made a "seven-figure" <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/04/08/private-equity-giant-apollo-invests-in-real-world-asset-platform-plume">investment</a> in blockchain project <span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/plume"><span><span><span>PLUME</span><span></span><span>$0.01102</span></span></span></a></span>, which focuses on bringing traditional financial products onchain. Apollo’s credit strategies have already been tokenized via third parties.

Earlier this week, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/11/blackrock-takes-first-defi-step-lists-buidl-on-uniswap-as-uni-jumps-25">said</a> it will make shares of its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, BUIDL, tradable on decentralized exchange Uniswap and purchased an undisclosed amount of the protocol's governance token UNI <span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/uniswap"><span><span><span>UNI</span><span></span><span>$3.5592</span></span></span></a></span>.</p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>Metaplanet operating profit to rise 81% in 2026 after soaring 17-fold last year on options writing</p><div><p>1 hour ago</p></div><figure><img alt="Stock market price charts (Anne Nygård/Unsplash)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F0ce20daadee6a2147c8807b254e696396e6f268d-1920x1080.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" /></figure><p>The company recorded a non-cash bitcoin valuation loss of 102.2 billion yen ($650 million) due to the cryptocurrency’s price drop.</p><div><p>What to know: </p><div><ul><li>Metaplanet reported a 17-fold increase in operating profit to 6.28 billion yen ($40.8 million) and a 738% rise in revenue.</li><li>Operating profit is forecast to rise 81% this year.</li><li>The company recorded a non-cash bitcoin valuation loss of 102.2 billion yen ($650 million) due to the cryptocurrency’s price drop.</li></ul></div></div><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/16/metaplanet-operating-profit-to-rise-81-in-2026-after-soaring-17-fold-last-year-on-options-writing">Read full story</a></p></div></div></div>

  <div class="content"><p>Summary created by Smart Answers AIIn summary:Macworld reports that iOS 26.4 beta has launched without the anticipated new Siri, despite bringing several notable updates across Apple’s ecosystem.Key features include RCS end-to-end encryption for Android messaging, enhanced video podcast experience, and AI-generated Apple Music playlists.The update appears significant for security with default Stolen Device Protection and productivity improvements through Freeform’s Creator Studio enhancement. After Apple released iOS 26.3 last week, we were anticipating the first beta release of iOS 26.4 with bated breath. That’s because rumors for the better part of a year have pointed to this update as the one to bring the revamped Siri that has been expected since 2024. However, after a rumor last week dampened those expectations considerably, it looks like iOS 26.4 will be another minor update as Apple continues to polish Siri. iOS 26.4 beta: New features We won’t know all of the new features and changes to expect in iOS 26.4 until the final version is released to users sometime in late March or Aoril.

New&nbsp;video&nbsp;podcast experience: Apple has announced that iOS 26.4 will enable HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) technology in the Podcast app to “switch seamlessly between watching and listening to shows.” RCS end-to-end encryption: It’s taken about a year, but Apple will finally encrypt RCS messages to and from Android phones in iOS 26.4.

Freeform: Apple’s whiteboarding app has gotten its Creator Studio update with new features and a new icon.

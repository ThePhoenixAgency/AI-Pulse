    <div><div> <p>A South Korean court found ex-president <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/yoon-suk-yeol/" target="_self">Yoon Suk Yeol</a> guilty of insurrection on Thursday, saying his <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/martial-law/" target="_self">martial law</a><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20260216-what-to-know-as-south-korea-ex-president-yoon-faces-insurrection-verdict" target="_self"> declaration</a> in December 2024 was a deliberate plot to "paralyse" the National Assembly.</p> <p>"As to defendant Yoon Suk Yeol, the crime of insurrection leadership is established," presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon told Seoul Central District Court.</p> <p>"The declaration of martial law resulted in enormous social costs, and it is difficult to find any indication that the defendant has expressed remorse for that," the judge said.</p> <p>The court sentenced the disgraced former leader to life imprisonment.</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20260219-jail-disgrace-and-death-the-dark-fates-of-south-korean-leaders" target="_self">Jail, disgrace and death: the dark fates of South Korean leaders</a></p> <p>Yoon abruptly declared martial law in a televised address in December 2024, saying drastic measures were needed to root out "anti-state forces".</p> <p>The 65-year-old hardline conservative was later impeached, arrested and charged with a litany of crimes ranging from insurrection to obstruction of justice.</p> <p>Prosecutors had sought the harshest penalty on the insurrection charges, urging the Seoul Central District Court to put Yoon on death row during hearings in January.</p> <p>South Korea has an unofficial moratorium on capital punishment – the last prisoners were executed in 1997 – with a death sentence effectively banishing Yoon to life behind bars.</p> <p>Long seen as a shining light of stable democracy in Asia, Yoon's failed bid to seize power stirred unpleasant memories of the military coups that jolted the nation between 1960 and 1980.</p> <p>Yoon has been held in solitary confinement while fighting multiple criminal trials.</p> <p>He has consistently denied wrongdoing, arguing he acted to "safeguard freedom" and restore constitutional order against what he called an opposition-led "legislative dictatorship".</p> <p>Prosecutors accused him of leading an "insurrection" driven by a "lust for power aimed at dictatorship and long-term rule".</p> <h2>Earlier sentence</h2> <p>Under South Korean law, only two sentences are fit for insurrection: life imprisonment or death.</p> <p>Yoon&nbsp;had already been sentenced to five years in prison on lesser charges, while a host of senior officials also face hefty prison terms.</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b783fc42-0d30-11f1-b92d-005056a90284/w:980/f9fcf08062054c59d4166737f4dd03912a5315e6.jpg" alt="Supporters of South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol in front of the Seoul Central District Court during a hearing in January."> <figcaption> <span>Supporters of South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol in front of the Seoul Central District Court during a hearing in January.</span> <span> Jung Yeon-je, AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Yoon broke into late-night TV on December 3, 2024, to deliver a shock address to the nation.</p> <p>Pointing to vague threats of North Korean influence and dangerous "anti-state forces", he declared the suspension of civilian government and the start of military rule.</p> <p>Martial law was lifted six hours later after lawmakers raced to the assembly building to hold an emergency vote.</p> <p>Staffers barricaded the doors with office furniture to keep armed troops at bay.</p> <p>The declaration triggered flash protests, sent the stock market into panic and caught key military allies such as the United States off guard.</p> <p>Yoon's wife Kim Keon Hee was sentenced to 20 months' jail earlier in January on unrelated charges stemming from bribes she took while first lady.</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AFP)</em></p> </div></div>

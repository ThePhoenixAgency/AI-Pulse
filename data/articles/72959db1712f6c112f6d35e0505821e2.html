						<p>The free to play Blue Archive from NEXON arrived on Steam last year, and they've confirmed upgrades are coming for Steam Deck and controller players. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/blue-archive-from-nexon-arrives-on-steam-and-works-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Covered here on GamingOnLinux back in July 2025</a>, the game already works on Linux / SteamOS even with their "NGS(Nexon Game Security)" anti-cheat (as listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a>).</p>
<p>Controller support is missing though, so especially on handhelds like the Steam Deck it's not ideal. In an <a href="https://forum.nexon.com/bluearchive-en/board_view?board=3028&amp;thread=3366029" target="_blank">announcement</a> from the Executive Producer, Yongha Kim, they confirmed:</p>
<p>"The gameplay for the PC client is also being improved. We are currently developing support for Steam Deck and controllers". We will continue to refine these features to ensure that Senseis can meet the students of Kivotos in a more seamless and polished environment."</p>

<p>There's also a bunch of new content coming to the game. Along with that, they're currently working to reduce time between updates to the game as they're now aiming for new releases every three months.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://postmarketos.org/">postmarketOS</a> project
has <a href="https://postmarketos.org/blog/2026/02/10/fosdem-and-hackathon/">published</a>
a recap from FOSDEM 2026, including the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/foss-on-mobile/">FOSS on
Mobile devroom</a>, and a summary of its <a href="https://postmarketos.org/blog/2026/02/10/fosdem-and-hackathon/#hackathon">post-FOSDEM
hackathon</a>. This includes decisions on governance and the project's
AI policy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>AI policy</strong>: our current <a href="https://docs.postmarketos.org/policies-and-processes/development/contributing-and-ai.html">AI
policy</a> does not state that we forbid the use of generative AI in
postmarketOS, so far this document just lists why we think it is a bad
idea and misaligned with the project values. We discussed this and
will soon change it (via merge request) to clearly state that we don't
want generative AI to be used in the project. It was also noted that
currently the policy is too long, it would make sense to split it into
the actual policy and still keep, but separate the reasoning from
it.</p>

<p>[...] <strong>Power delegation and teams</strong>: in over two
hours we discussed how to move forward with [postmarketOS change
request] <a href="https://gitlab.postmarketos.org/postmarketOS/pmcr/-/merge_requests/14">PMCR 0008</a> to organize
ourselves better, and how it fits with soon having a legal entity. We
figured that we need to rename "The Board" (which is currently for
financial oversight) to "Financial Team", as we will soon have a new
board for the legal entity. In the end our idea was to have the new
board refer to an "assembly" for all important decisions, and this
"assembly" would just be all Trusted Contributors in postmarketOS. The
Core Contributors team would be dissolved in favor of having several
topic-specific teams (a lot of which we already have, such as the
infra team). This way we would have a very flat decision
structure. The PMCR will be updated soon and discussed further
there. <a href="https://postmarketos.org/team/#casey-connolly-kcxt">Casey</a>
also asked <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@cas/116017957165300406">on fedi</a> for further feedback and got a lot of input.</p>

<p>Other topics include reaching out to resellers to sell phones with
postmarketOS preinstalled, security, and more.</p>

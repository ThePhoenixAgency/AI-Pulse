On February 9, Goldman Sachs released a research note discussing concerns about how AI could disrupt small and mid-cap software companies. The research firm used a “clear, repeatable AI Impact Framework” to identify where AI may create risks or opportunities for companies, including MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB).</p>      <p>The framework looked at six areas, including orchestration risk, monetization exposure, system-of-record ownership, data integration moat, AI execution, and budget alignment. Goldman Sachs concluded that these software companies, including MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB), benefit from “durable economics, mission-critical platform roles and tangible AI product innovation” that offer “meaningful insulation in a period of elevated uncertainty.” The research firm maintained a constructive outlook on software names, as it sees “credible paths for AI to reinforce rather than undermine long-term growth.”</p>   <figure><div> <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UQU50gcQV2bZhxtGC_0q4g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUzOA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/a0cfe973a19643bd80c80b95a491c1bf" alt="Here&amp;#39;s What Analysts Are Saying About MongoDB (MDB)" /></p></div> <figcaption>Here's What Analysts Are Saying About MongoDB (MDB)  </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Earlier, on January 30, BofA Securities increased its price target on MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) from $480 to $500 and maintained a Buy rating. The firm pointed to the company’s successful dual approach of top-down enterprise sales and bottom-up product-led growth.</p>   <p>BofA Securities also pointed out that MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) continues to focus on expanding its product portfolio for AI and modernization of legacy applications.</p>      <p>MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) is an American software company that is known for its globally distributed database platform that supports applications with integrated capabilities for operational data, search, real-time analytics, and AI-powered data retrieval.</p>   <p>While we acknowledge the potential of MDB as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

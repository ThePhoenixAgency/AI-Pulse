<p>Apple is preparing a major internal reset with iOS 27, and this time the focus is not flashy features but stability, performance, and battery life. The upcoming update aims to clean up years of layered code, improve older apps, and refine the Liquid Glass interface without introducing dramatic visual changes. As a result, users should see a smoother experience and better efficiency across devices.</p>



<p>The company wants to fix long-standing issues that have led to bugs, inconsistent performance, and battery drain. Over the past few years, many users noticed that Apple’s software no longer feels as polished as it once did. With iOS 27, Apple plans to address those complaints directly by focusing on what happens behind the scenes rather than what appears on the surface.</p>



<p><em>Bloomberg’s </em>Mark Gurman detailed these plans in the new edition of his Power On <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27">newsletter</a>. He described iOS as “a bit of a mess under the hood” and said Apple intends to “tidy” its codebase by removing “scraps” of old code, rewriting certain features, and subtly upgrading older apps to “let them perform better.” He also reported that engineers are working on underlying changes that should improve efficiency and give users more battery life.</p>



<h2>Code Cleanup and Performance Gains</h2>



<p>Apple’s strategy centers on four clear steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Removing outdated code that no longer serves a purpose</li>



<li>Rewriting certain system features for stability</li>



<li>Making small Liquid Glass interface tweaks without major design shifts</li>



<li>Upgrading older apps so they run faster and more efficiently</li>
</ul>



<p>This cleanup effort resembles what Apple did <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/ios-27-reportedly-takes-a-snow-leopard-route-to-restore-software-quality/">years ago with macOS Snow Leopard</a>, where the company prioritized performance over new features. Gurman noted that engineers expect the rewritten code to create “efficiency gains that will end up giving users more juice.” Apple has not confirmed whether it will market battery improvements directly or simply present them as part of overall system enhancements.</p>



<p>The company also plans to make small interface refinements to Liquid Glass. However, users should not expect a major redesign. Instead, Apple will focus on responsiveness and stability while keeping the existing visual direction intact.</p>



<h2>AI and Siri Delays Move to iOS 27</h2>



<p>Beyond performance work, Apple is pushing forward with its AI strategy. Some advanced Siri features first promised at WWDC 2024 have faced delays and are now shifting toward iOS 27. These include deeper personal context awareness and improved on-screen understanding.</p>



<p>Gurman reported that parts of the revamped Siri will arrive in later versions of iOS 26, while others will move to iOS 27. He wrote that Apple remains within its public 2026 timeline but acknowledged that the delay marks a significant gap between announcement and release.</p>



<p>Apple is also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apples-answers-team-quietly-builds-a-chatgpt-style-search-tool/">developing a more chatbot-style</a> Siri experience. The company needs to close the gap with competitors that have moved faster in AI development. At the same time, Apple continues to prioritize privacy and system integration.</p>



<p>With iOS 27, Apple is trying to restore confidence in its software quality while building a stronger foundation for future devices. If the company delivers on cleaner code, better performance, and improved battery life, users will notice the difference immediately.</p>

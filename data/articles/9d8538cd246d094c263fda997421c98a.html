          <p><a href="https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-26-04-release-features/">Ubuntu 26.04 development</a> is progressing rapidly. While there are welcome changes, their decision to <a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/ubuntu-software-and-updates-removal/">remove the classic Software &amp; Updates tool</a> from the upcoming release is unpleasant for me. This was the GUI tool that allowed you to manage the repositories. The reasoning is that it is "dangerous or too complex for normal users". I lowkey disagree with that. Your thoughts are welcome.</p><p><strong>Here's the highlight of this edition of FOSS Weekly:</strong></p><ul><li>An open source robotic arm.</li><li>The final Linux release in the 6.x series.</li><li>Tiling window in Ubuntu.</li><li>Trying AI for actual sysadmin works.</li><li>And other Linux news, tips, and, of course, memes!</li></ul><h2> Linux and Open Source News</h2><p>Here's a summary of the news this week.</p><p><a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/pdf-editor?ref=itsfoss.com">ONLYOFFICE now has an online PDF editor</a> that can be used from a web browser. Their desktop application already has the PDF editing ability.</p><p><a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/libreoffice-26-2-release/">LibreOffice 26.2</a> brings faster Calc scrolling, better Excel paste support, and better floating table handling in Writer. You can now import and export Markdown files with clipboard support. XLSX files default to the Excel 2010-365 format.</p><p>DI.DAY is <a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/di-day-celebration/">a monthly movement to ditch Big Tech</a>, happening on the first Sunday of every month. Launched by Save Social and Chaos Computer Club, the community runs workshops on degoogling phones, installing Linux, and configuring Nextcloud. The next one's on March 1.</p><p><a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/kernel-6-19-release/">Linux kernel 6.19</a> is out. ASUS ROG handhelds get official Armoury driver support, AMD VMs can now run 4096 vCPUs instead of 512, and older Radeon cards use the AMDGPU driver for better performance.</p><p><a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/group-office-26-0-release/">Group-Office 26.0</a> brings Collabora Online to the free tier for real-time document editing. The new <em>Kanban</em> board module handles visual workflows, and the <em>Projects</em> module gets time approval so managers can review entries before they're finalized.</p><p>Warp terminal (non-FOSS tool) <a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/warp-launches-oz/">launched a Claude like AI agent for its terminal</a>. Apparently, like Vibe Coding, VibeOps is also a real term, used for AI-assisted DevOps activities. And this is why we will be seeing more AI agents for the terminal workflow.</p><h2> What We’re Thinking About</h2><p>Emacs won over modern AI writing tools <a href="https://itsfoss.com/emacs-the-ux-ideal/">for this novelist's sci-fi project</a>. He spent years fighting with Neovim configs, finally switched and got the novel done.</p>

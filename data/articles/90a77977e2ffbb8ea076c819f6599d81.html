          <p>This spring, a Southern California beach town will become the first city in the country where municipal parking enforcement vehicles will use an AI system looking for potential bike lane violations.</p>
<p>Beginning in April, the City of Santa Monica will bring <a href="https://www.hayden.ai/press/beyond-buses-hayden-ai-to-deploy-on-parking-enforcement-vehicles-for-the-first-time">Hayden AI’s scanning technology</a> to seven cars in its parking enforcement fleet, expanding beyond similar cameras already mounted on city buses.</p>
<p>“The more we can reduce the amount of illegal parking, the safer we can make it for bike riders,” Charley Territo, chief growth officer at Hayden AI, told Ars.</p>
<p>Hayden AI’s bus cameras, designed to detect bike lane and bus zone violations, currently exist in two other California cities: Oakland and Sacramento. The company also has installations around the country, including New York City, Washington, DC, and Philadelphia. In September 2025, the company <a href="https://www.hayden.ai/press/hayden-ai-celebrates-2000-system-installations-">announced</a> that it had installed 2,000 systems on buses worldwide.</p>
<p>Late last year, over a 59-day period, Hayden AI also said its technology <a href="https://www.hayden.ai/press/hayden-ai-partners-with-a-california-university-to-deploy-automated-bike-lane-and-bus-stop-enforcement">detected</a> over 1,100 parking violations at the University of California, San Diego—and 88 percent of those were instances of blocking a bike lane.</p>
<p>Hayden AI says it sells its product to municipalities and related entities to not only increase bus speed (by removing obstructions) but also improve safety.</p>
<p>“We do that by [reducing] one of the biggest causes of collisions with buses—moving out of their lanes,” Territo added. “So the fewer times they have to make a turn, the fewer instances there are [of a crash].”</p>

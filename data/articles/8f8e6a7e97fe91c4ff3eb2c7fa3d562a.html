    <div><div><h2>Strategy says it can survive even if bitcoin drops to $8,000 and will 'equitize' debt</h2><h2>Strategy says it can withstand a bitcoin price drop to $8,000 and still cover its roughly $6 billion in net debt. </h2><p><span> Feb 16, 2026, 9:08 a.m. </span></p></div><div><p>Bitcoin <span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin"><span><span><span>BTC</span><span></span><span>$68,960.51</span></span></span></a></span> treasury firm Strategy (MSTR) said it can ride out a potential plunge in the price of the largest cryptocurrency to $8,000 and still honor its debt.</p><p>"Strategy can withstand a drawdown in $BTC price to $8K and still have sufficient assets to fully cover our debt," the Michael Saylor-led company <a href="https://x.com/Strategy/status/2023088526904967568" target="_blank">said on X</a>.</p><div><p><span>STORY CONTINUES BELOW</span></p></div><p>The company, which holds more bitcoin than any other publicly traded company, has accumulated 714,644 BTC, worth roughly $49.3 billion at current prices, since adopting it as a treasury asset in 2020. </p><p>Over the years, it has stacked bitcoin via debt, a tactic echoed by peers such as Tokyo-listed Metaplanet (3350). It owes about $6 billion — equivalent to 86,956 BTC — against bitcoin holdings over eight times larger.</p><p>While these debt-financed bitcoin buys were widely cheered during the crypto bull run, they have become a liability in the wake of the token's crash to nearly $60,000 from its October peak of over $126,000. </p><p>If Strategy is forced to liquidate its bitcoin holdings to pay off the debt, it could flood the market and drive prices even lower.</p><p>In the Sunday post, Strategy assured investors its bitcoin holdings would still be worth $6 billion even at an $8,000 BTC price, enough to cover its debt.</p><figure><img alt="Details of Strategy's net debt and BTC holdings in bear scenarios. (Strategy)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F96f52d3f576dc95a88423f9da0c79586cc57c085-3200x1800.jpg%3Fauto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><p></p><figcaption>Strategy's finances. (Strategy) </figcaption><p></p></figure><p>The company noted that it doesn't have to pay all its debt at once, as the due dates are spread over 2027 and 2032.</p><p>To further assuage concerns, Strategy said it plans to switch existing convertible debt into equity to avoid issuing additional senior debt. Convertible debt is a loan that lenders can swap for MSTR shares if the stock price rises high enough. </p><h2>Not everyone is impressed</h2><p>Skeptics remain.</p><p>Critics like pseudonymous macro asset manager Capitalists Exploits <a href="https://x.com/capitalistexp/status/2021763431108628753?s=20" target="_blank">point out</a> that while $8,000 bitcoin might technically cover the $6 billion net debt, Strategy reportedly paid around $54 billion for its stash, an average of $76,000 per BTC. A slide to $8,000 would amount to a whopping $48 billion paper loss, making the balance sheet look ugly to lenders and investors.</p><p>Cash on hand would cover only about 2.5 years of debt and dividend payments at current rates, the observer argued, and the software business pulls in just $500 million a year. That's way too little to handle the $8.2 billion in convertible bonds plus $8 billion in preferred shares, which demand hefty, ongoing dividends like endless interest bills.</p><p>All this means that refinancing may not be readily available if bitcoin drops to $8,000.</p><p>"Traditional lenders are unlikely to refinance a company whose primary asset has depreciated significantly, with conversion options rendered economically worthless, deteriorating credit metrics, and a stated policy of holding BTC long-term (limiting collateral liquidity)," the observer said in a post on X. "New debt issuance would likely require yields of 15-20% or higher to attract investors, or could fail entirely in stressed market conditions." </p><h2>Dump on retail investors</h2><p>Anton Golub, chief business officer at crypto exchange Freedx, called the "equitizing" move a planned "dump on retail investors."</p><p>He explained that buyers of Strategy's convertible bonds have been primarily Wall Street hedge funds, who aren't bitcoin fans but "volatility arbitrageurs."</p><p>The arbitrage involves hedge funds profiting from discrepancies between the expected or implied volatility of a convertible bond's embedded options and the actual volatility of the underlying stock. </p><p>Funds typically buy cheap convertible bonds and bet against, or "short," the stock. This setup helps them bypass big price swings, while earning from bond interest, ups-and-downs volatility, and a "pull-to-par" boost where deep-discount bonds rise toward full value at maturity.</p><p>According to Golub, Strategy's convertible bonds were priced for small ups and downs. But the stock swung wildly, letting hedge funds mint money from the arbitrage: buying the bonds cheaply while betting against the stock.</p><p>This setup worked beautifully when shares traded above $400, the trigger for bondholders to convert debt into stock. Hedge funds closed their shorts, bonds vanished via conversion, and Strategy avoided cash payouts.</p><p>At $130 a share, conversion makes no sense. So hedge funds will likely demand full cash repayment when the bonds mature, potentially putting Strategy's finances under strain. </p><p>Golub expects the firm to respond by diluting shares. </p><p>"Strategy will: dilute shareholders by issuing new shares, dump on retail via ATM sales, to raise cash to pay hedge funds," he said in an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antongolub_i-will-explain-what-saylor-means-when-he-activity-7428888305724841984-u4CB/" target="_blank">explainer post on LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>"Strategy only looks genius during Bitcoin bull markets. In bear markets, dilution is real and destroys MSTR shareholders," he added.</p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>'We do not do illegal things': Inside a U.S.-sanctioned stablecoin issuer's race to build a crypto giant</p><div><p>7 hours ago</p></div><figure><img alt="Oleg Ogienko, director for regulatory and overseas affairs at A7A5, at Consensus in Hong Kong (provided)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F238e8417f724d49356943e426db32a2ff0a80efa-926x999.png%3Frect%3D0%2C192%2C926%2C521%26w%3D1920%26h%3D1080%26auto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><p>Oleg Ogienko, the public face of A7A5, pitched the ruble-pegged stablecoin as a fast-growing trade rail built to move money across borders despite sanctions pressure.

</p><p>The rumor traces back to a post from "America's Last Line of Defense," a network known for publishing fabricated stories presented as satire. Screenshots of the post circulated on Facebook and other platforms without the page's disclaimer, giving the false impression it was a legitimate report.
</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ALLODSatire/posts/apple-music-has-fired-jay-z-as-producer-of-its-super-bowl-halftime-shows-after-1/1231920582403564/">The original post</a> claims Apple Music "fired" Jay-Z after years of producing the halftime show. There is no supporting evidence from Apple, the NFL, Roc Nation, or any credible news outlet.
</p><h2>What Jay-Z's actual job is, and who could even "fire" him</h2><p>In 2019, the NFL named Roc Nation its Live Music Entertainment Strategist. Jay-Z, through Roc Nation, has been involved in consulting and producing the Super Bowl halftime show since then.
</p><p>Apple Music became the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/09/23/nfl-apple-music">title sponsor</a> of the halftime show beginning in 2022. Sponsorship branding, however, is not the same thing as production control. The NFL owns the event, and its partnership with Roc Nation governs the entertainment strategy.
</p><p>No statement from the NFL, Roc Nation, or Apple Music indicates any change to that relationship. If such a high-profile partnership ended, it would be announced formally and widely reported, not surface first as a viral meme.
</p><h2>The alternative halftime show and the 5 million claim</h2><p>The rumor gained traction alongside discussion of Turning Point USA's "All-American Halftime Show," an online counter-programming effort streamed during Super Bowl LX. Turning Point USA claimed its YouTube stream peaked at roughly 5.2 million concurrent viewers.
</p><div><p><a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66693-139836-IMG_5790-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66693-139836-IMG_5790-xl.jpg" alt="Man in an open-collared shirt and dark blazer tilts his head, holding a frayed straw hat on top, against a clear blue sky background"></a></p><p><span>Singer Bad Bunny headline the halftime show for Super Bowl LX</span></p></div><p>That figure, assuming it's accurate, represents a fraction of the main broadcast audience. According to Nielsen, Super Bowl LX averaged 124.9 million viewers across platforms and peaked at 137.8 million. The halftime window alone is credited for retaining 128.2 million viewers.
</p><p>Turning Point USA promoted its alternative show as "family-friendly" and rooted in traditional values. The featured performer who poorly lip-synced half of his most popular song, Kid Rock, built his career on provocation and explicit material, such as lyrics about sexually abusing minors — the opposite of family values.
</p><p>The culture-war framing likely boosted engagement around the event because of its political satire roots. People even started spreading unrelated claims about Apple Music and Jay-Z. </p><p>Viral stories often pop up during big moments like the Super Bowl, especially when celebrity politics are in the mix.</p> </div> </article> </main> </div></div>

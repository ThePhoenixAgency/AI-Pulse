The glove being studied appears to match one that was worn by a suspect who appeared in doorbell-camera footage taken the night Nancy Guthrie went missing.</p></div><div><p>Authorities believe the suspect in the video kidnapped Guthrie in the early hours of 1 February.</p></div><div><p>The FBI said on Sunday that investigators recovered the glove from a field near the side of the road about two miles (three km) from Guthrie's home in Tucson, Arizona. </p></div><div><p>The agency collected about 16 gloves from various locations near her home, though most turned out to have been discarded by people searching for Guthrie.</p></div><div><p>"The one with the DNA profile recovered is different and appears to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video," the FBI said. </p></div><div><p>The agency said it has received preliminary DNA test results on the glove and is still waiting for "quality control and official confirmation" before entering an "unknown male profile" into its database.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a9c1/live/02750170-0b14-11f1-b5e2-dd58fc65f0f6.jpg.webp" alt="NBC / Today via Reuters Nancy Guthrie is on the left and Savannah Guthrie on the right, on the set of NBC's morning show Today.

CBS also reported that the backpack is only sold at Walmart stores.</p></div><div><p>Officials have been reviewing surveillance footage from nearby Walmart locations, Nanos said, though a corporate spokesperson declined to comment to CBS.</p></div><div><figure><p></p><figcaption>Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's home</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Police have said the suspect description "remains a key focus", but added that "investigators are not ruling out any individuals or possibilities".</p></div><div><p>Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when a family member dropped her off at her home following a get-together at her other daughter Annie Guthrie's house. </p></div><div><p>Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.</p></div><div><p>In the two weeks since Guthrie's disappearance, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Office have conducted a <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c77e4n7p353o">massive search operation</a> involving helicopters, sniffer dogs and hundreds of officers, while taking in thousands of call-in tips. </p></div><div><p>Officials have warned that her health may be at severe risk without her medication. Nanos, the local sheriff, has said she is "not in good physical health" but has no reported cognitive issues.</p></div><div><p>Local officials have also said investigators found DNA at Guthrie's address that did not belong to her or anyone close to her.</p></div><div><p>The FBI has increased the reward for information about her disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.</p></div></article></div></div>

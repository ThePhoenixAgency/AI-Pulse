  <div class="content"><p>In today’s edition of the Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman shared a number of new details about Apple’s upcoming software release: iOS 27. The company is aiming to ‘tidy’ its codebase, upgrade older apps, and tweak Liquid Glass – and as a result, battery life should hopefully improve. It’s been previously reported that iOS 27 would mostly focus on performance improvements and stability. However, today’s report includes three key details on how the company will accomplish that: Removing ‘scraps’ of old code Some interface ‘tweaks’, but nothing massive Subtly upgrading old apps to ‘let them perform better’ In the report, Gurman describes iOS as ‘a bit of the mess under the hood’. If you’ve used any of Apple’s software in recent years – you’ve definitely noticed an uptick in bugs, poor performance at times, and less battery life. Apple’s software quality used to be one of its strong suits, so the recent decay has been disappointing at times to say the least. With all of this code cleanup across the board, Gurman reports that engineers are also working towards providing better battery life: The company hopes that underlying code changes will result in efficiency gains that will end up giving users more juice. If Apple does indeed pull off these improvements, it’s unclear if the company will market the changes —&nbsp;or if this is just a benefit of cleaning things up. Lastly, Apple is also focusing on improving its AI features in iOS 27. Recently, Bloomberg reported that some of Apple’s key Siri promises made at WWDC 2024 would be delayed to iOS 27. We’ve also heard Apple is working towards a Siri chatbot of sorts for iOS 27, though it’s likely there’ll be even more to come as we get closer to the keynote in June.

          <p>The gradual shift of technology from buying physical hardware to streaming and subscription has left us with <a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/digital-content-ownership-illusion/">very less ownership of anything</a>. It is quite the sad state of affairs, because even if you have paid for something, it is not you anymore who controls is. </p><p>As a result, more and more <a href="https://itsfoss.com/self-hosting-rising/">Linux users have been moving towards self-hosting services</a> for their media, ranging from films, software to books. </p><p>And that's exactly what we're talking about today: the best software to self-host your e-book library.</p><h2>What is an eBook server software?</h2><p>If you have a good collection of ebooks in various file formats, you probably organize them in various folders based on the genre, reading state and other critera. An digital library software helps you organize it automatically and beautifully with poper thumbnails, author name and other metadata. But this stays on a single computer. An eBook server software lets you access those ebooks from other devices connected to the server. You can read them via web browser, on a supported reader or download them on your eBook reader device. Some software even allows you to sync your reading progress across devices.</p><p>Think of it like <a href="https://itsfoss.com/media-server-software/">media server software</a> but for eBooks.</p><p>Now, self-hosting any open source software comes with its own set of challenges. Self-hosting ebook server is no different. But this article is not about setting up an eBook server. It's about presenting you with the various options that can be used for your self hosted ebook library.</p><h2>1.

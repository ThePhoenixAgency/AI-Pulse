<p><strong>Key Insights (AI-assisted):</strong><br />
By formalizing a multi-track partner structure around LoRaWAN and Massive IoT, Netmore is pushing the LPWAN market toward more platform-like, repeatable engagement models. This move signals that differentiation in IoT connectivity is shifting from pure network coverage to ecosystem orchestration and commercial predictability. It also reinforces consolidation dynamics following Actility’s acquisition, concentrating influence over device certification, pricing models, and reference architectures. Overall, this underscores a broader IoT trend where scalable growth depends on curated, interoperable partner networks rather than ad-hoc bilateral integrations.
</p>
<h2>Program continues Netmore’s drive to transform IoT market fragmentation into a new world of connections</h2>
<p>Netmore Group, the leading network operator and platform provider for Massive IoT, today announced the launch of the <strong>Netmore Pulse partner program</strong>, a comprehensive program designed to provide partners with early insight into opportunities, accelerate new use cases, and turn local expertise into scalable, joint success.</p>
<p>The program, available worldwide, addresses longstanding industry fragmentation by combining Netmore’s network services and commercial leadership with solutions and devices proven capable to scale in markets demanding predictability and high service levels. Program participants are positioned as a qualified, low-risk choice for large-scale IoT projects, while end customers searching for trusted, high-performing partners now gain a powerful advantage by knowing solutions and hardware are ready to run at scale on the Netmore platform.</p>
<p>With over 200 ecosystem existing partners and the unification of world-leading partner ecosystems through its recent acquisition of Actility, Netmore’s introduction of the Pulse program is a natural evolution to a more systematic approach of driving innovation and streamlining the deployment of end-to-end IoT solutions.</p>

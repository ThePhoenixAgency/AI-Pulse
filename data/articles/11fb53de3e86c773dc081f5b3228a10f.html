<div> <p>The impending inauguration of New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani invites coverage of the usual safety information. At the event, no large bags, drones, strollers, or, remarkably, Raspberry Pis or Flipper Zero devices are allowed. The last two entries on the list are the popular single-board computer (SBC) and the Swiss Army knife of hacking tools. The latter, sure, that could be used for some nefarious deeds, but the Raspberry Pi? That would take some work.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GLWBEYw8FwtDkokQmoFUzW.jpg" alt="Invitation to the inauguration">

Whether it's an inauguration, concert, or large-scale event, everyone has the right to feel safe, and that is where event <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security">security</a> comes into play. In an open invitation to New Yorkers, the Mayor-Elect invites everyone to attend the inauguration on January 1st, bring a hat and scarf to keep warm, and some snacks to share, but you'll have to leave your Raspberry Pi at home. Why? Is this more "Security theater" than actual security?</p><p>No reason is given; attendees are just told not to bring them. So if you wanted to set up a time-lapse camera or make some cool LED lights to celebrate the inauguration, you are out of luck. The Flipper Zero, which is legal to carry, does have the capability to monitor and interfere with many different signals, but if that were the only reason to prohibit the devices at the event, then organizers would also have to prohibit other, more powerful portable electronic devices — your smartphone being one of them.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero both have programmable GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins that could be used with "devices" to cause injury or interference, but naming them directly is unusual. Laptops are not prohibited, despite offering much more power and portability than a Raspberry Pi. Your laptop has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and even a GPIO that could be exploited. Putting Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero on the same list as "Weapons, fireworks or explosives" doesn't tell us why they are prohibited, but it does put them in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>Could they be used as nefarious, criminal devices that cause terror? Yes, if one were to put their mind to it, most objects could be used for such purposes. Perhaps the list of prohibited items should really focus on using terms to describe the use or intent of the prohibited item? Rather than Raspberry Pi or Flipper Zero, we should see "Single Board Computers", "Microcontrollers", "Signal Interception", or "Electronic Hacking tools". As Adafruit's <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/12/30/nyc-mayoral-inauguration-bans-raspberry-pi-and-flipper-zero-alongside-explosives/" target="_blank">blog post</a> so eloquently states, "Public safety is a beacon, a flashlight, not a fog machine."</p><p>The world of television and movies has already used the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-films-tv/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> as the "McGuffin," a device that moves the plot forward, in shows such as Mr Robot (the Raspberry Pi changes from a model B to B+ between shots), Person of Interest, and even Big Hero 6.</p><div>

</div><p>Are the names "Raspberry Pi" and "Flipper Zero" being used in the same way that we often use the brand to identify an object? For example, in the UK, we often say "Hoover" to mean "vacuum cleaner", "Biro" for a pen. US readers will often use "Band-Aid" for a plaster, "Velcro" for a hook-and-loop fastener, and "<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/google">Google</a>" for an internet search. If the Raspberry Pi and Flipper Zero products are being used in that manner, then it is unfortunate, and a little education is required. I can almost guarantee that there will be a Raspberry Pi powering some device or installation inside.</p><div><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><p>So could we just take an Arduino-powered LED light show to the inauguration? In theory, yes. Your ESP32, Wemos D1 Mini, and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/arduino-uno-q-review" target="_blank">Arduino Uno Q</a> are all <em>technically</em> allowed at the inauguration, and those are very similar devices with similar capabilities.

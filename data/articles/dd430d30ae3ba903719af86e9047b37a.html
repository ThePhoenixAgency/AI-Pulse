A copy of the letter can be <a href="http://insidermonkey.com/blog/wasatch-global-investors-small-cap-growth-strategys-q4-2025-letter-1682242/" target="_blank"><strong>downloaded here</strong></a>. The Wasatch Small Cap Growth Strategy experienced a challenging fourth quarter as small-cap equities lagged broader market indices, reflecting investor caution and a continued preference for larger, more liquid stocks. During the period, the Russell 2000® Growth Index gained 1.22%, while the strategy finished the quarter in negative territory, with performance driven by stock-specific factors rather than macroeconomic stress. Results contrasted with strength in select areas of the small-cap market, as biotechnology emerged as one of the strongest segments, with the biotech component of the Russell 2000® Growth Index rising nearly 27%. For the 2025 calendar year, the Russell 2000 Growth Index advanced 13.01%, while the strategy posted a loss, highlighting the impact of earnings volatility and valuation compression across several holdings despite management citing improving fundamentals and easing financial conditions as potential longer-term supports.

(NYSE:FOUR) in its Q4 2025 investor letter:</p>    <blockquote><p><strong>Shift4 Payments, Inc. (NYSE:FOUR)</strong> was the largest detractor from strategy performance for the fourth quarter. A longtime holding in many of our small cap strategies, Shift4 is a U.S. company that provides payment processing solutions for hospitality, retail and e‑commerce businesses. Fundamentals for the company remain solid, in our view. But the stock was down after a competitor reported disappointing results, raising concerns for the industry. While there are concerns that consumer spending could soften and affect some of Shift4’s end markets, we still like the firm’s long-term growth potential.</p> </blockquote>  </div></div> <span> </span>  </article>      <section><header> </header>  <div><ul> <p>Weʼre unable to load stories right now.</p>  </ul></div> </section></div>        </main> </div></div>

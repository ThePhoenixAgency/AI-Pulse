"I was like, no way. Oh my God."</p></div><div><p>Sides, who has been dancing for 60 years and teaches ballroom dancing classes, said she had signed up for TV extra work with an agency, and responded to a call-out for senior dancers on behalf of an "unknown artist". </p></div><div><p>After being shortlisted, Sides received a call confirming she had been specifically chosen by the artist out of hundreds of applications.</p></div><div><p>But she had no idea record-breaking Swift was behind the request.</p></div><div><p>Sides said the whole experience was "hush-hush" and all she had been told was that the job involved recreating a dance competition.</p></div><div><p>It was only ten minutes before filming began that she found out the video was for a track from Swift's latest album, The Life of a Showgirl.</p></div><div><p>Sides, a Swiftie herself, said she was in shock when the singer walked in.</p></div><div><p>"I still feel excited now [remembering it]," she said.</p></div><div><p>Sides said Swift, who sang in and directed the video, put everyone at ease during filming and thanked dancers for their time. </p></div><div><p>"She knew exactly what she wanted. She'd say, 'try this, try that,' and she was really nice about it," said the dance teacher.</p></div><div><p>"Some can be a bit abrupt but she wasn't. She was lovely and so talented."</p></div><div><p>In the video, Sides can be seen wearing a royal blue ballroom dancing outfit she has owned since becoming a professional dancer in 1988.</p></div><div><p>She said Swift complimented her outfit and said: "I love your dress. It really fits the set."</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e9c6/live/edd590e0-0366-11f1-bab5-81d0d0b0abce.jpg.webp" alt="TAS Rights Management Graham Norton, Taylor Swift and Domhnall Gleeson in the video for Taylor Swift's Opalite"><span>TAS Rights Management</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Graham Norton's chat show played a role in the video's casting</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>When Sides saw the video, which was filmed in November but released earlier this month, she said she was gobsmacked.</p></div><div><p>"You just can't believe it's you," she said.</p></div><div><p>It was difficult to keep the experience a secret too, she added: "It was hard, I only told a few people in my dance class and my family."</p></div><div><p>Opalite features Domhnall Gleeson, Lewis Capaldi, Greta Lee and a cameo voiceover from Cillian Murphy, all of whom appeared on the Graham Norton show with Swift in October.</p></div><div><p>It tells the story of a lonely woman who uses a magical spray to improve her life and finds romance with a fellow loner.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2fff/live/b0ae7700-0365-11f1-b5e2-dd58fc65f0f6.jpg.webp" alt="Matt Crossick / PA Media The cast of Taylor Swift's Opalite video on Graham Norton's sofa"><span>Matt Crossick / PA Media</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The video's cast all featured on Graham Norton's chat show last October</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Despite dancing her whole life and with decades of acting experience, Sides said the shoot with Swift was the most important of her career. </p></div><div><p>She said she hoped her experience would inspire others to try dancing.</p></div><div><p>"Maybe people will think, 'Well, if Taylor chose her, why don't we?'," she said.</p></div><div><p>"You're never too old.

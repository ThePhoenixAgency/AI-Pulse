    <div><div><article><div><p>Apple's autocorrect on iPhone and iPad always aims to help when you're typing a message, but it's by no means perfect, and some of the replacements it continually spews out can be frustrating. Fortunately, Apple's software includes a feature called Text Replacement that allows you to specify what word or phrase replaces the specific text you type in. </p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/20WuT67suyZryJWcPBdEJKwppPk=/400x0/article-new/2026/02/on-my-way-text-replacement.jpg?lossy" alt="On my way" /><br />Even if you haven't set up Text Replacement, you can try it out with Apple's pre-set example: In any app that accepts text input, type "Omw" followed by a space, and it will change to "On my way!" automatically.</p>
<p>The following steps guide you through the process of setting up your own handy shortcut phrases with text replacements on both iOS devices and Mac.<br />
</p>
<h2>How to Set Up Text Replacement on iPhone</h2>

</li><li>Tap the plus (<strong>+</strong>) button in the top-right corner of the screen.</li>
<li>On the next screen, fill in the "Phrase" field with the text you want to appear every time you type your shortcut.</li>

</li></ol>
<h2>How to Set Up Text Replacement on Mac</h2>
<p>The following steps work on Macs running macOS Ventura and later.</p>
<ol>
<li>On your Mac, click the  logo in the top-left corner of the menu bar at the top of the screen and select <strong>System Settings...</strong>. </li>
<li>Scroll down and select <strong>Keyboard</strong> in the sidebar.</li>
<li>Under "Text Input," click <strong>Text Replacements...</strong>.<br /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/seCxUxYG_y21ADbdW61bTKRTWmM=/400x0/article-new/2026/02/macos-text-replacement.jpg?lossy" alt="settings" /><br />

</li><li>Click the <strong>+</strong> button to add a text replacement.<br /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/bjuNsxSP6L2c6E_ghbmpqEmqPro=/400x0/article-new/2026/02/macos-add-text-replacement-1.jpg?lossy" alt="settings" /><br />

</li><li>In the "Replace" column, enter the text that you want replaced with something else.</li>
<li>In the "With" column, type the replacement text that you want it to change to.<br /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/k4JY43ux1f8WXV4hQ_7gy6CsmfY=/400x0/article-new/2026/02/add-macrumors-text-replacement.jpg?lossy" alt="settings" /><br />
</li></ol>
<p>If you're using the same Apple account across all of your Apple devices, any Text Replacements that you add on your Mac will be automatically synced to your iPhone and/or iPad, and vice versa.</p>

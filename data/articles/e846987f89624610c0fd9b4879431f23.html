<p>I've tried dozens and dozens of PS5 games now that we're into the console's sixth year, and there really is a vast range of titles to choose from now. I've played and reviewed a whole host of titles on both of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>'s PS5 consoles, and have spotted a few to recommend today.</p><p>When you're looking to add to your library (or backlog), holiday sales days are the perfect time to pick up PS5 games at cheaper rates, giving you bombastic, thrilling, and memorable experiences without breaking the bank.</p><div><p><span>Chosen by</span></p><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xzLvmTAxDomnqnHMVyQsZN.jpg" alt="A headshot of TechRadar Gaming managing editor Rob Dwiar" /></div></figure></div><div><p><span>Chosen by</span></p></div><p>I'm a PS5 and PlayStation enthusiast, collector, and mega fan, and have played and reviewed dozens of games for the console.

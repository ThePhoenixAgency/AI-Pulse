And he signed the decision memorandum on the US’s deeply controversial new vaccine schedule.</p><p>He’s also a longevity enthusiast. In an exclusive interview with <em>MIT Technology Review</em> earlier this month, O’Neill described his plans to increase human healthspan through longevity-focused research supported by ARPA-H, a federal agency dedicated to biomedical breakthroughs. Fellow longevity enthusiasts said they hope he will bring attention and funding to their cause.</p></div>  <p>At the same time, O’Neill defended reducing the number of broadly recommended childhood vaccines, a move that has been widely criticized by experts in medicine and public health. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/13/1132889/us-deputy-health-secretary-vaccine-guidelines-longevity-arpa-h-cdc-nih/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*">Read the full story</a>.</p>

 <p><strong>The myth of the high-tech heist</strong></p>  <p>Making a movie is a lot like pulling off a heist. That’s what Steven Soderbergh—director of the <em>Ocean</em>’s franchise, among other heist-y classics—said a few years ago. You come up with a creative angle, put together a team of specialists, figure out how to beat the technological challenges, rehearse, move with Swiss-watch precision, and—if you do it right—redistribute some wealth.</p>  <p>But conversely, pulling off a heist isn’t much like the movies. Surveillance cameras, computer-controlled alarms, knockout gas, and lasers hardly ever feature in big-ticket crime. In reality, technical countermeasures are rarely a problem, and high-tech gadgets are rarely a solution. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/13/1132397/myth-of-high-tech-heist/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*">Read the full story</a>.</p>  <p><em>—Adam Rogers</em></p> </div><div> <p><strong>This story is from the next print issue of<em> MIT Technology Review</em> magazine, which is all about crime.

That doesn’t mean you should.</strong></p>  <p>Americans have a new set of diet guidelines. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken an old-fashioned food pyramid, turned it upside down, and plonked a steak and a stick of butter in prime positions.</p> 

 <div><p>Kennedy and his Make America Healthy Again mates have long been extolling the virtues of meat and whole-fat dairy, so it wasn’t too surprising to see those foods recommended alongside vegetables and whole grains (despite the well-established fact that too much saturated fat can be extremely bad for you).</p><p>Some influencers have taken the meat trend to extremes, following a “carnivore diet.” A recent review of research into nutrition misinformation on social media found that a lot of shared diet information is nonsense. But what’s new is that some of this misinformation comes from the people who now lead America’s federal health agencies. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/02/13/1132848/rfk-jr-carnivore-diet-maha-social-media/?utm_source=the_download&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_download.unpaid.engagement&amp;utm_term=*%7CSUBCLASS%7C*&amp;utm_content=*%7CDATE:m-d-Y%7C*">Read the full story</a>.</p></div>  <p><em>—Jessica Hamzelou</em></p>  <p><strong>This article first appeared in The Checkup, <em>MIT Technology Review</em>’s weekly biotech newsletter.

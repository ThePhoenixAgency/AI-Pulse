    <div><div> <figure><p><img src="https://blog.arduino.cc/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/setup_completo-1024x660.jpg" alt=""></p></figure> <p>Control theory is beautiful on paper – elegant equations, perfectly modeled systems, textbook-perfect responses. But between the mathematical ideal and the physical system lies a gap that trips up many engineers: noise, timing constraints, actuator limits, and the stubborn reality of hardware that refuses to behave exactly as the model predicts.</p> <p>Cristian Castro Lagos, a Chilean electronics engineer with nearly a decade of industrial experience and part-time professor at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, has made bridging that gap his specialty. His <a href="https://github.com/CrissCCL">GitHub portfolio</a> is packed with meticulously documented projects that show exactly <strong>how control theory becomes embedded reality</strong> – complete with system identification, controller design, discretization, and real-time validation. And Arduino has been his platform of choice for <strong>rapid prototyping and experimentation</strong> throughout that journey.</p> <p>We caught up with Cristian to learn more about his approach to making advanced control engineering tangible, reproducible, and accessible.</p> <h2>Closing the gap between theory and hardware</h2> <p><strong>How did you first get interested in electronics and embedded systems?</strong></p> <p>My interest in electronics grew from a realization during my engineering studies: control theory only becomes truly meaningful when it interacts with physical systems.</p> <p>The first time I implemented a digital controller on a microcontroller and observed the physical response match the mathematical model, everything connected. That experience showed me that embedded systems are the bridge between theory and reality – and I decided to focus my work on building that bridge properly.</p> <p><strong>What role did Arduino play in your academic training, and how do you still use the platform today?</strong></p> <p>Arduino played a crucial role in my education because it allowed me to prototype control algorithms quickly and focus on system behavior rather than low-level hardware barriers.&nbsp;</p> <p>In my projects today, I combine academic training and industrial experience. The former provides structured thinking and mathematical rigor, while the latter forces you to deal with uncertainty, noise, and constraints.&nbsp;</p> <p>I design controllers analytically, but I validate them under real-world conditions. For this, I use Arduino compatible platforms as experimental control laboratories, allowing me to implement real-time digital controllers, validate models, analyze disturbances, and test robustness. It’s not just a learning tool –&nbsp;it is a rapid-development platform for serious embedded control experimentation.</p> <p><strong>You maintain an active GitHub with documented projects that others can learn from and build upon. What motivated you to start sharing your work publicly?</strong></p> <p>I realized that many engineers understand control theory conceptually but struggle to see how it is implemented in real hardware.</p> <p>By documenting complete workflows – from system identification to embedded deployment – I aim to make advanced control engineering tangible and reproducible.</p> <p>Sharing also improves my own thinking. When you explain something clearly, you refine your engineering process.</p> <p><strong>Is there a particular project you’re especially proud of?</strong></p> <p>One project I’m particularly proud of is <a href="https://github.com/CrissCCL/Temp_ControlMod">a closed-loop temperature control platform</a> that integrates ARX system identification, digital PI design, discretization, and real-time embedded validation.</p> <p>It represents a complete engineering cycle: data acquisition, model identification, controller design, discretization, embedded implementation, and experimental verification.</p> <p>The platform uses an <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-leonardo-with-headers">Arduino Leonardo</a> board to manage real-time sampling, implement the discrete PI algorithm, handle actuator saturation, and log performance data – all while maintaining deterministic timing. It demonstrates how mathematical models become physical, measurable system behavior – which is the essence of control engineering. This workflow reflects how real-world control systems are developed in professional engineering environments.</p> <p>You can see the full workflow documented on my GitHub, including hardware schematics, firmware implementation, and experimental validation data.</p> <figure><p><img src="https://blog.arduino.cc/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/esquema_control_temp-1024x576.png" alt=""></p></figure> <p><strong>What do you think is ahead for the field of embedded systems?</strong></p> <p>The future of embedded systems lies in combining classical control rigor with intelligent edge computation.</p> <p>We will see more real-time intelligence at the edge, stronger integration between data-driven modeling and control design, accessible hardware platforms enabling serious experimentation, and greater alignment between academic training and industrial deployment.</p> <p>Platforms that allow engineers to prototype, validate, and iterate quickly will shape the next generation of embedded systems.</p> <h2>Building bridges, blurring boundaries</h2> <p>Cristian’s work embodies something we see across the Arduino community: the belief that powerful tools should be accessible. Just check out his projects online: from <a href="https://github.com/CrissCCL/FLotation_Column_control_HMI">flotation column control systems</a> to <a href="https://github.com/CrissCCL/UAV_Dual_IMU">dual-IMU evaluation boards for UAVs</a>, each repository is a complete reference that other engineers can study, reproduce, and build upon.</p> <p><strong>Have your own Arduino powered engineering projects to share?</strong> Post them on <a href="https://projecthub.arduino.cc/">Arduino Project Hub</a> or reach out to us at creators@arduino.cc. We love celebrating the community members who are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with accessible hardware.</p> </div></div>

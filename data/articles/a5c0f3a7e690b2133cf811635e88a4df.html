At press time, the sector stood at $6.12 billion.</p>   <p>More than 1.2 million ounces of physical gold are now locked in custody to back these digital tokens, highlighting growing demand for blockchain-based representations of bullion.</p>   <figure><div> <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zir48KRakIFFiOk0hJ4lUg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUyNA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/beincrypto_us_662/4c97fc142607940d5fe76ea2ca56d564" alt="Tokenized Gold Market" /></p></div> <figcaption>Tokenized Gold Market. Source: Dune  </figcaption> </figure>   <p>Tether Gold (XAUT) remains the dominant player, with a market capitalization of $3.5 billion. It accounts for over half of the total tokenized gold market.</p>   <p>According to Token Terminal data, its market cap has surged more than 50% over the past month alone. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino previously stated that the company plans to increase gold exposure to 10–15% of its overall investment portfolio.</p>        <p>The firm has significantly accelerated its gold accumulation strategy, reportedly outpacing sovereign buyers such as Greece, Qatar, and Australia. In the last quarter of 2025, Tether added 27 metric tons of gold to its fund exposure.</p>   <p>Furthermore, Tether made a $150 million strategic investment in the precious metals platform Gold.com. The transaction gave Tether approximately 12% ownership of the company.</p>   <p>This partnership will also allow Tether to integrate XAUT into Gold.com’s platform. The collaboration is designed to broaden “access to gold across digital and traditional distribution channels.”</p>   <blockquote><p>“The companies are also exploring options to enable customers to purchase physical gold using digital currencies such as USD₮, the world’s largest stablecoin, and USA₮, the newly launched, federally regulated, dollar-backed stablecoin,” Tether wrote.</p> </blockquote>   <p>In addition to its expansion efforts, Tether also launched Scudo, a measurement unit representing 1/1,000 of an XAUT (Gold Ounce)</p>       <p>Paxos-issued PAX Gold (PAXG) ranks second in the sector with a market capitalization of $2.3 billion, following a 33.2% increase over the past month. Together, XAUT and PAXG account for the majority of activity within the tokenized gold ecosystem.</p>  </div></div> <span> </span>  </article>      </div></div>

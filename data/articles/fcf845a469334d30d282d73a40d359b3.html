<p>The UAE Tour is the finale of the early season stage races held in the Middle East and is the longest, hardest and most prestigious. Three time winner Tadej Pogačar isn't on the start list but 2023 winner Remco Evenepoel rides and in the Slovenian's absence will assume the role of favourite.</p>
<h2><span>2026 UAE Tour event preview</span></h2>
<p>The UAE Tour returns for its 8th edition without World Champion Tadej Pogačar but with a whole host of top talent ready to take his title. With the Slovenien choosing to start his season at Strade Bianche, Team UAE, in its home race are pinning their hopes on the young Mexican <strong>Isaac del Toro</strong>. UAE's heir apparent certainly has the talent to take the race but with have to deal with a rampant <strong>Remco Evenepoel </strong>who already has an incredible six wins under his belt this year.</p><p>Also in the mix will be the likes of Adam Yates, Felix Gall, Michael Storer, Ilan Van Wilder, Ben Tulett and favourite for the flat time trial, Josh Tarling.</p><p>The race kicks off with a sprint stage then heads into the 12.2 km time trial on stage 2 where Remco will be looking to take time on all his GC rivals. Up next is the first of two giant summit finishes, the 15km ascent to Jebel Mobrah on stage 3, followed by a pair of sprint stages before the final showdown on stage 6. The legendary slopes of Jebel Hafeet will certainly decide the winner before proceedings are wrapped up with a final sprint showcase along the Abu Dhabi Breakwater on stage 7.</p><p>Aside from the big name GC favourites there are plenty of top sprinters looking for bragging rights lead by the giant Italian Jonathan Milan who will be looking to add to his tally of wins this year.</p><p><strong>Stage one</strong> is dubbed the 'Desert Stage' as it heads to the Moreed Dunes with its purpose built cycle path which features some nasty double digit gradients. The stage will almost certainly come down to a sprint though in front of Liwa Palace.</p><p>Coverage starts at 10.45 (GMT) 05:45 (EST) 02:45 (PST)</p><p>Read on for everything you need to know to <strong>watch a 2026 UAE Tour live stream from anywhere.</strong></p>

Although not having what it took to beat the best, he found his forte was racing up hills and so began his fascination with steep roads. This resulted in his 2010’s best-selling <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0711231206/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0711231206&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=100climbs-21&amp;linkId=a6703b717464318f393dc0227862606d" target="_blank">100 Greatest Cycling Climbs</a>, followed to date by 14 more guides to vertical pain. Covering the British Isles, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain he has been riding and racing up hills and mountains for over 30 years now. He hosts talks, guides rides, has written columns for magazines and in 2020 released his first book of cycling routes, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ride-Britain-Inspirational-Dartmoor-Highlands/dp/1472144546" target="_blank">RIDE BRITAIN</a>.

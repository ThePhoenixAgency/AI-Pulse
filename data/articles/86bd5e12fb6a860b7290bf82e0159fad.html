If you do so, you cannot hide from us — we will find you, arrest you, and prosecute you," Bondi wrote on social media Friday. "This Department of Justice STANDS for Christians and all Americans of faith."</p></div><div><p>All 39 people arrested are charged with conspiracy against religious freedom at a place of worship and injuring, intimidating and interfering with the exercise of the right of religious freedom at a place of worship.</p></div><div><p>"A group of approximately 40 agitators, including all of the defendants named in this Indictment, entered the Church in a coordinated takeover-style attack and engaged in acts of oppression, intimidation, threats, interference, and physical obstruction alleged herein," the indictment says. </p></div><div><p>In the 18 January incident, protesters interrupted a service in the church by chanting "ICE out" and "Justice for Renee Good", the mother of three who was fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last month in Minneapolis. </p></div><div><p>Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other.</p></div><div><p>Lemon was live-streaming the incident when it happened, and he has defended his decision to enter the church, saying he was simply carrying out his duty as an independent journalist covering a protest.</p></div><div><p>"I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now," he said soon after he was arrested.</p></div><div><p>But the indictment alleges that Lemon and the other co-defendants "entered the Church in a coordinated takeover-style attack and engaged in acts of oppression, intimidation, threats, interference, and physical obstruction".</p></div><div><p>Doug Wardlow, the lawyer representing Cities Church, celebrated the news of additional arrests, saying it "sends a clear message: houses of worship are off limits for those who would use chaos and intimidation to advance a political agenda".</p></div><div><p>In the statement posted to social media, Wardlow said the protest "placed congregants, including children, in fear for their lives".</p></div><div><p>Three weeks after Good's death and a week after the church protest, federal agents fatally shot a second person, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti. </p></div><div><p>Both Pretti and Good were killed as they were protesting against the Trump administration's immigration-enforcement efforts in Minnesota, an operation that has since ended.</p></div></article></div></div>

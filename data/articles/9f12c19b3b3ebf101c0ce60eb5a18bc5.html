The result outperformed all previous quarters, breaking the previous record of 1.3GW added in the third quarter of 2021, according to the Clean <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/energy-australia">Energy</a> Council’s latest quarterly investment report.</p><p>Four new utility-scale batteries were deployed in Q4 – totalling 1GW/2.3GWh – tripling the record set in the previous quarter (Q3 2025).

Sixty-three per cent of total renewable generation capacity that was switched on in 2025 was delivered in Q4.</p> <p>The seasonal rush to close out on projects before years’ end, together with more political stability in the second half of 2025, ended the year on a stronger note than where it started.

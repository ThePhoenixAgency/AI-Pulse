A breathtakingly beautiful family."</p></div><div><p>Ashton Kutcher, who starred alongside Dane in 2010's Valentine's Day, also paid tribute on social media: "Miss you, buddy. Let's keep fighting the fight to solve ALS."</p></div><div><p>Nina Dobrev separately said he "led with kindness and made everyone on our set feel seen". The pair starred together in 2022's Redeeming Love.</p></div><div><p>"He was warm, generous, prepared, and so passionate about what he did," she wrote on Instagram. "ALS is a cruel and unforgiving disease.

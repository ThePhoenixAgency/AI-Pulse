                    <p>News that the improved <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/siri">Siri</a> is delayed don't fully ring true, but tales of Apple Health+ being at least trimmed down do. Plus one in four smartphones is now an iPhone, and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-creator-studio">Apple Creator Studio</a> continues to have surprises, all on the AppleInsider+ podcast.
</p><p>Sometimes news can be too bad to be true. While there is a report that all of the key new Siri features have been delayed, it doesn't quite hold water. 
</p><p>Whereas longer-term reports of Apple cutting back on its plans for a Health+ subscription service seem more likely. Or at least <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-health">Apple Health+</a> is sufficiently far off that nobody will remember these claims when it finally launches.
</p><p>But then speaking of launches, Apple's most recent one has had some ups and downs. Apple Creator Studio's launch on the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/app-store">App Store</a> was rocky, the apps have had issues, and now there's a question over how much users can actually use its AI features.
</p><p>Where there's a question, there's often also an answer and in this case, it's that we can't use the AI features remotely as much as Apple promises.

This time, Apple is looking like the bad guy over the App Store but maybe there is a way it could end all of its legal cases with developers and governments, in a single move. Or maybe not.

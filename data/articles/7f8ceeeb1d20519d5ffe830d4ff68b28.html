    <p>Hi HN,
I am the solo developer behind this.
The Pitch:
It is a card-based resource management game (inspired by Reigns) where you work IT support for a corporation taken over by eldritch horrors. You have to balance ticket resolution, budget, and entropy while dealing with printers that violate causality.
The Architecture:
The entire game is built in React/JavaScript. Under the hood, it is basically a giant state machine. I chose this stack because it allowed me to iterate quickly on the UI and text-heavy elements, which are 90% of the gameplay. I've published other games that were more run of the mill and made in Godot, but I'm a full stack developer by day and most of my day-to-day is in nextJS. I just... I just missed easy state work, ok? Don't shoot me. I was half afraid that building executables/binaries for Steam would be a nightmare but it turned out (after a bit of futzing about with Tauri for linux) to be not too bad.
The Build Pipeline (Tauri vs Electron):
Packaging a web app for Steam Deck was the biggest hurdle.
Windows: I use Tauri. It is lighter and creates a much smaller binary since it uses the OS webview.
Steam Deck / Linux: I had to use Electron.</p>

    function scrollToTop() {
      window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'auto' });
    }
    function scrollToBottom() {
      window.scrollTo({ top: document.documentElement.scrollHeight, behavior: 'auto' });
    }
    window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
      const data = event && event.data;
      if (!data || data.type !== 'AI_PULSE_SCROLL') return;
      if (data.direction === 'up' || data.direction === 'top') scrollToTop();
      if (data.direction === 'down' || data.direction === 'bottom') scrollToBottom();
    });
  </script>

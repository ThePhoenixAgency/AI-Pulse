<p><strong>Key Insights (AI-assisted):</strong><br>
Southeast Asia’s accelerating fleet management adoption signals a rapid maturation of commercial vehicle IoT in emerging markets. Growing penetration from basic tracking to richer telematics and video capabilities will increase data volumes, driving demand for analytics, edge processing and secure cloud connectivity. The strong role of white-label platforms indicates a modular, OEM-agnostic ecosystem where local service providers focus on integration and compliance rather than core technology. This evolution aligns SEA with global trends toward data-driven, safety-centric, and regulation-influenced connected fleet operations.</p>
<h2>Southeast Asia Fleet Management Market Set for Double-Digit Growth as Adoption Accelerates Across the Region</h2>
<p><strong>The market for fleet management (FM) solutions in Southeast Asia (SEA)</strong> has been in a growth period for several years. The market experienced quite significant setbacks during the pandemic, but the current outlook is positive due to several factors such as general economic growth, increasing competition in the transportation and logistics sector as well as a growing awareness of fleet telematics. The total number of FM systems in active use is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.3 percent from about 3.6 million units in 2024 to over 6.4 million units by 2029. The penetration rate in the total population of fleet vehicles used by businesses is at the same time estimated to increase from 17.5 percent in 2024 to 27.1 percent in 2029.</p>
<p>The report covers the following key markets in Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam. The report also includes an overview of the Rest of SEA. The <strong>fleet management markets in Southeast Asia</strong> to a large extent resemble each other but are also affected by different regulations and general economic growth levels in the respective countries. Common characteristics between the markets include being less developed than other regions of the world and having comparably low penetration rates from an international perspective. </p>
<p>Far from all deployments are full-scale advanced fleet management solutions and a notable share of the total installed base is represented by relatively basic tracking systems with fairly limited FM functionality. The adoption of more feature-rich fleet management systems is however increasing across the entire region. One country that stands out from the crowd is Singapore, where more advanced fleet management solutions with a higher price point have had a higher adoption also historically. </p>
<p>William Ankréus, IoT Analyst, Berg Insight, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“While the fleet telematics industry in Southeast Asia is in many respects still nascent, video telematics have in the last few years experienced significant interest and adoption across the region, driven by government initiatives to improve driver and road safety. Video telematics is now a strategically important part of most vendors’ offerings in Southeast Asia.”</p>

<p>Berg Insight ranks Jimi IoT, Cartrack (Karooooo) and TransTRACK as the largest providers of fleet management solutions in Southeast Asia. These three companies all have total installed bases of over 200,000 fleet management units in SEA on their respective platforms. Included in the top-5 are also Italian Tierra through its Indonesian subsidiary Weeo and DTC from Thailand. Other top-15 vendors with estimated installed bases of more than 40,000 active units in the region include local and regional solution providers such as Vietnamese BA GPS, Lithuania-based Gurtam, Onelink and GPSiam based in Thailand, WanWayTech from China, SquareGPS (Navixy) headquartered in the US, Indonesian EasyGo and McEasy, VIETMAP from Vietnam and Geotab from Canada. </p>
<p><em>“Notably, international providers of white-label solutions have done particularly well in Southeast Asia as telematics service providers in the region have opted for faster time to market and the flexibility of readymade solutions”</em>, concluded Mr. Ankréus. </p>
<p>Additional vendors moreover include Astrata Group, V3 Smart Technologies and Overdrive IoT based in Singapore, the Malaysian companies Gussman Technologies, Total Dynamic, Katsana and Safetruck, EUPFin from Taiwan, Swedish GpsGate, Radius Telematics from the UK, Thailand-based Nostra Logistics and Tramigo headquartered in Finland.</p> </div></div>

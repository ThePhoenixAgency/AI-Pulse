<div> <p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> has just announced a press event – well, technically an 'experience', which suggests something slightly lower-key – taking place on March 4, 2026, in New York, as well as <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023408889644118375" target="_blank">London and Shanghai</a>.</p><p>As ever, the company is keeping tight-lipped about what product launches we might see at the event, with nothing specific mentioned in the press invite itself.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jHNgJpi8yeKTSP3XqUsZ6Q.jpg" alt="A person using Apple&amp;#039;s M5 MacBook Pro laptop.">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's break down the likely revelations for the March event, which <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023413534076678349" target="_blank">Gurman believes is going to consist of online announcements</a> and hands-on previews at the three locations. Then we'll look at what we might <em>not</em> see at this event (sorry – 'experience', which again hints at a hands-on feel).</p><hr><h2>1. MacBook Pro with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips</h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7M553kQPKzXrQgSaQYL9B7.jpg" alt="The MacBook (2016) 12-inch sat on a bush">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There have been strong rumors that Apple will release new MacBook Pro models with more powerful processors early this year, and tipster Mark Gurman has previously suggested these laptops would debut in the first week of March. Obviously, that lines up perfectly with this event.</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><p>Also, don't forget that we've recently seen that new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/macbooks/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-buyers-beware-you-might-face-huge-delays-getting-your-laptop-but-its-not-because-of-the-ram-crisis">MacBook Pro M4 Max orders are delayed substantially</a>, which is normally the case with an outgoing model, as stock is run down to prepare for its successor. So, all signs point to these new portables being imminent.</p><p>Of course, the new processors in the MacBook Pro will be the M5 Pro and M5 Max, but there might be something very different about them this time around – namely that both CPUs may be built on the same base chip. The M5 Max, a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/macbooks/the-m5-pro-and-m5-max-macbook-pro-could-be-here-in-weeks-and-a-new-leak-suggests-theyll-have-a-big-change-in-store">recently aired theory runs</a>, would effectively be the higher-binned silicon, and the M5 Pro would be a lower-binned variant with a lesser amount of CPU and GPU cores based on the configuration chosen.</p><p>Take that with some seasoning, but it might mean MacBook Pro buyers are going to benefit from more customization options with these higher-end processors.</p><h2>2. A cheaper MacBook with A18 chip</h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8HgZttLtFd75a56TgB8HzM.jpg" alt="MacBook Air 2019">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another much-rumored possibility is a new bottom-tier MacBook that's much more affordable than the MacBook Air.</p><p>Apparently, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/apples-rumored-cheap-macbook-could-be-powered-by-an-iphone-chip-here-are-6-things-to-expect">Apple's plan with this is to use an iPhone processor</a> – the A18 Pro, seemingly – to cut the cost of making such a device, as well as dropping down to 8GB of system RAM. (Which notably would defy its recent stance to deploy 16GB with all its Macs).</p><p>The idea with the price is obviously to make it affordable, possibly around the $699 to $799 mark in the US, or so runs the latest speculation – which has also put forward the belief that Apple's going all-in with this one. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/macbooks/apple-could-defy-the-ram-crisis-with-a-rumored-cheaper-macbook-which-sounds-like-its-biggest-laptop-launch-for-years">We're told shipments could be in the order of 5 to 8 million units</a>, which would represent about a quarter of last's years total sales for Macs.</p><p>The clue I mentioned at the outset, <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023411510194905425" target="_blank">flagged by Gurman on X</a>, is that the colors on the press invite are light green, blue and yellow – which just happens to be the same colors seen on the test laptops for the affordable MacBook. It could mean nothing, of course, but I think that's a pretty heavy hint.</p><h2>3. iPhone 17e</h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yJQcVeaFXRrXsanPJgoiQ8.jpg" alt="The Apple iPhone 16e held at a slant at a window">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Zachariah Kelly / TechRadar)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As noted at the outset, the iPhone 16e arrived at a press event a year ago, and there were already firm rumors that the iPhone 17e is 'imminent' – <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-17e-could-land-imminently-with-no-price-rise-but-it-might-barely-be-an-upgrade">in fact we heard that last week</a>. With this press event now revealed, we can put two and two together and, erm – actually, maybe we should be putting 8.5 and 8.5 together to get 17.</p><p>Again, it's Mark Gurman who believes this mid-range iPhone is close on the horizon, but the bad news is that the leaker isn't anticipating the device to be much of an upgrade on the existing model.</p><p>The main move will simply be upgrading the engine from the A18 chip to A19, which will obviously help the smartphone to be peppier – and another neat extra could be the introduction of MagSafe support.</p><p>While it may not be a hugely exciting new launch, and more of an iterative upgrade, the better news is that Apple is expected to hold the price of the iPhone 17e steady at $599 / £599 / AU$999 for this punchier handset. That's particularly good to hear given that we're in a full-blown RAM crisis (and storage is facing serious price hikes, too).</p><h2>4. iPad Air (8th-gen)</h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BN5MzaihErGQSGi3xaNP2h.jpg" alt="A person using the 2024 iPad Air with an Apple Pencil.">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're expecting a couple of new iPads, including a refreshed Air model. A bit like the rumored iPhone 17e, this iPad Air is not supposed to be a major step forward, but it will get a chip upgrade – from the M3 in the current model to the M4. A tablet packing the M4 chipset would be quite something in terms of power and portability, of course.</p><h2>5. iPad (12th-gen)</h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ki3iEMDn46KXpQaU5r6hjH.jpg" alt="11th Gen iPad (A16) Review">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Jacob Krol/Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Along with the iPad Air, we're expecting a new iPad (which would be the 12th-gen incarnation). Again, this is expected to be a modest revamp, with the key move being Apple upgrading the A16 chip to an A18.</p><p>That's a sizable leap, and one that should see the iPad incorporate Apple Intelligence – with the current model not able to do so. Those keen on AI, then, will be glad to see that happen – if it does.</p><p>As ever, take all these rumors – <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tablets/ipad/dont-buy-a-new-ipad-just-yet-two-new-models-are-set-to-launch-soon-with-future-proofing-upgrades">all this iPad speculation again comes from Mark Gurman</a> – with a suitable dose of seasoning.</p><h2>What we're less likely to get – although you never know…</h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JiD9GiV677Z4cWGunpj7dh.jpg" alt="Studio Display on wooden desk">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A revamped Studio Display, or Mac Studio, is a possibility that some people are certainly keeping their fingers crossed for. These devices are <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/macs/the-apple-mac-roadmap-for-2025-and-2026-may-have-leaked-through-macos-tahoe-26">rumored for a refresh in the first half of 2026</a>, but I'm not sure we'll see them just yet.</p><p>The same is true for the MacBook Air M5, which has also been rumored for early this year. But the new MacBook Pro models, and affordable MacBook, feel like more likely inclusions – and Apple surely won't be launching too many MacBooks at once.</p><p>Some folks are hopeful for a new Apple TV, but that seems unlikely to happen just yet, and <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023410166432137720" target="_blank">Gurman explicitly pours cold water</a> on the idea of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/ios/siris-new-gemini-powered-brain-is-almost-here-find-out-how-to-try-it-in-ios-26-4-this-month">Siri's big AI overhaul</a> taking center stage here (though we'll likely hear something about it, or be treated to some teasers at least – or maybe a bit more).</p><hr><p><em></em><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

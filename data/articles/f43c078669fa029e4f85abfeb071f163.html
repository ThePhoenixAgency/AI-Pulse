    <div><div><div><h4>In brief</h4><ul>
<li>Harvard cut its IBIT stake by 1.46 million shares in Q4, now valued at about $265 million.</li>
<li>It moved in with an $86.8 million position in BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF.</li>
<li>The move could signal rotation into Ethereum, broader diversification, or compliance-driven positioning, Decrypt was told.</li>
</ul></div><p>Harvard Management Company has reduced its stake in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF by roughly a fifth in the fourth quarter and started a new position with a spot Ethereum ETF.</p><p>According to a <a href="http://edgar.secdatabase.com/87/119312526051702/filing-main.htm" target="_blank">filing</a> with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the previous quarter, the endowment manager reported lower holdings of the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust and disclosed a first-time position in the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF.</p><p>It held 5,353,612 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust as of December 31, down from 6,813,612 shares in Q3, and reported a market value of about $265.8 million for that position at year-end.</p><p>Notably, the same filing lists 3,873,044 new shares of the iShares Ethereum Trust, valued at roughly $86.8 million, bringing the combined spot crypto ETF exposure to just over $352 million at quarter-end.</p><p>Harvard first <a href="https://decrypt.co/334366/harvard-116-million-blackrock-bitcoin-etf" target="_blank">disclosed</a> a $116 million position in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust in August last year. By November, it had <a href="https://decrypt.co/348838/harvard-triples-bitcoin-position-emory-expands-btc-etf-holdings" target="_blank">tripled</a> those holdings to roughly $350 million in market value at the time.</p><p>Harvard’s latest adjustments to its crypto ETF holdings come amid choppy conditions from late 2025, when spot Bitcoin ETFs saw bouts of net outflows continuing through <a href="https://decrypt.co/353832/bitcoin-etfs-shed-243m-as-crypto-market-rally-cools" target="_blank">January</a> and <a href="https://decrypt.co/358008/bitcoin-etfs-shed-410m-amid-btcs-ongoing-slump" target="_blank">February</a> this year.</p><h2>Diversification and positioning</h2><p>Industry observers are divided over whether the reallocation reflects relative value positioning, diversification, or institutional constraints shaping Harvard’s digital asset strategy.</p><p>Harvard is likely “making a relative value trade with the belief that ETH is undervalued relative to BTC,” Sean Bill, co-founder and chief investment officer at Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, told <i>Decrypt</i>, adding that the endowment may have “a limit on the initial exposure that it can maintain in digital assets” and could have reduced its Bitcoin stake “to make room for a short-term trade in ETH.”</p><p>Still, he said the 13F is “a good tool to track the general sentiment of the filing entity,” noting that HMC "initiated a long position in BTC in Q2 2025, grew that position and held it through the downturn,” which in his view signals sustained long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s place in institutional portfolios.</p><p>“Harvard’s decision to trim its Bitcoin ETF exposure while initiating a position in an Ethereum ETF likely reflects a more differentiated view of opportunity across digital assets,” Jennifer Ouarrag, Head of Legal at institutional staking provider Twinstake, told <i>Decrypt</i>.</p><p>While Bitcoin remains “the primary institutional store-of-value proxy,” Ethereum “offers exposure to a broader smart-contract ecosystem.” Such a differentiation could signal that “a recalibration toward assets with multiple return drivers,” is in line, she added.</p><p>The move “mirrors recent institutional behavior, where allocators have rotated capital between Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and shown increased interest in staking-enabled products that offer both price exposure and network participation income,” she said.</p><p>“One functions as immutable money. The other is programmable infrastructure,” Nima Beni, founder of Bitlease, told <i>Decrypt</i>. “Both belong in institutional portfolios, but treating them as substitutes risks misunderstanding their structural differences.”</p><p>Harvard’s trade “likely reflects regulatory clarity and ETF accessibility, optimizing for near-term compliance comfort rather than long-term structural positioning,” Beni added.</p><h2>‘The thesis works’</h2><p>Some have described the move as a “textbook allocator move,” with Iva Wisher, founder of Bitcoin-native execution environment Midl, arguing that it reflects a move away from “single-asset crypto exposure” rather than a loss of faith in Bitcoin.</p><p>Someone at Harvard’s committee “might've just said 'the thesis works, now let's build a real portfolio around it’,” he said. “When a $50 billion endowment starts treating digital assets as an asset class rather than a single bet, that's a maturity signal.”</p><p>The trim “doesn’t mean they prefer one over the other, they’re a long-term investor and it’s more of a nuanced view of risk and opportunity,” Abdul Rafay Gadit, co-founder of Zigchain, told <i>Decrypt</i>. “The more meaningful signal isn’t the precise ETF weighting in a single quarter, but whether institutions are incrementally expanding their comfort with on-chain infrastructure over time.”</p></div></div>

Shane is wearing a blue shift and Ilya is wearing a black shirt."><span>Enid Din/@enid.din</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Fans inspired by Heated Rivalry have created their own Boys Love-style art of iconic scenes</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>It's an age-old story: boy meets boy. </p></div><div><p>Charged glances catch across a crowded room. Fingers gently graze against a shared water bottle. </p></div><div><p>What begins as a series of secret trysts swells over a decade into fervent, undeniable love. Ginger ales and tuna melts are had. A cottage becomes a home.</p></div><div><p>These have become deeply familiar references as there's not a recess of the Internet - and most of the world - that hasn't ravenously consumed the queer romance between elite hockey stars Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov in Heated Rivalry.</p></div><div><p>When Anna, a self-described "Heated Rivalry obsessive", watched the show it reminded her of a world she already knew - the Chinese male-male romance stories she had grown up reading.</p></div><div><p>Branded as "danmei" - or indulgence in beauty - the genre is part of a beloved lineage of gay romance that has long catered to female fantasy.</p></div><div><p>Anna calls Heated Rivalry the "best Western danmei show I've seen in a long time".</p></div><div><p>The show's meteoric success has caught industry insiders, critics, and even the creators and stars themselves, off-guard. What has surprised so many, at least in the West, is how women - straight, queer, trans, "wine moms", daughters and your grandmother's Facebook group - have embraced Heated Rivalry's intimate portrait of queer love.</p></div><div><p>But in Asia, the genre of romance between men, broadly known as Boys' Love (BL), has a long history: for decades it has thrived as a subculture haven of romantic fantasy and escapism for women and the queer community.</p></div><div><p></p><h2>'It's their own paradise'</h2><p></p></div><div><p>Heated Rivalry has an undeniable kinship with Asian Boys' Love stories, says Anna, a BL enthusiast since she was a teen. </p></div><div><p>"Yes, the sex is hot, but the way it's used to show intimacy and the characters' internal lives is so unique. I think that's why I, and a lot of women, love it - it's the emotional slow burn."</p></div><div><p>That is also what she enjoys most in Boys' Love stories: "The tenderness, the yearning and the emotional connection between the two male leads."</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b6a2/live/044e7d70-07d4-11f1-9972-d3f265c101c6.jpg.webp" alt="Po/@polarts_ Fan art of Shane and Ilya wearing black tuxedos in a scene from Heated Rivalry."><span>Po/@polarts_</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>A memorable encounter between Shane and Ilya in the show</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Boys' Love emerged in Japan's manga scene in the 1970s with comics that explored same-sex male relationships. It evolved into the "yaoi" genre of fiction and art centered around male/male erotic love stories, largely written and consumed by women.</p></div><div><p>Some fans of Heated Rivalry have even affectionately dubbed the show, which is partly funded by public money "Canadian government-funded yaoi". </p></div><div><p>"The story shares themes often found in BL, such as the desire to love freely despite internalised homophobia and the contrast between... vulnerable emotions and a hyper-masculine environment," says Chicca, an illustrator and BL fan. </p></div><div><p>She has since recreated Heated Rivalry's swoon-worthy moments in the style of Japanese manga. Enid, an illustrator based in the Philippines, has also recast the show in anime, inspired by that feeling of "I want what they have" which first drew her to BL, she says. </p></div><div><p>Over the decades, Boys' Love spread through online forums as the internet bloomed, gaining a fiercely loyal fanbase across East and South East Asia, often conservative cultures where queer love still carries stigma.</p></div><div><p>There, BL fans can indulge in a buffet of build-your-own love stories: a chaste campus romance between teen boys, the duelling passions of a pair of mythical martial arts warriors, or gay spirits that get a shot at a happily-ever-after.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f2f/live/01ab7c10-1208-11f1-9120-a910fc22c6ac.jpg.webp" alt="Enid Din/@enid.din Fan art of Shane and Ilya lying on a sofa during an iconic scene at the cottage. Shane is wearing a blue shift and Ilya is wearing a black shirt."><span>Enid Din/@enid.din</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Ilya and Shane at the cottage inspired by Japanese anime</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Venturing into this world as a teen had an alluring "cool" factor for Dr Aiqing Wang, now a senior lecturer in Chinese at the University of Liverpool. She likened it to being part of a secret community. </p></div><div><p>It was a space where she and her female friends could engage with Boys' Love in a way that afforded them more agency over their own pleasure. Through "feel-good writing", they could depict the men and relationships they longed to see, but "can't have in real life".</p></div><div><p>"They can cast the female gaze against those male characters and challenge the traditional norms on women," Wang says.</p></div><div><p>"It's their own paradise… to create a safe world, an ideal world that they create for themselves, and they enjoy themselves."</p></div><div><p>Women who grow up in more conservative Asian societies tend to begin their sexual lives later than their Western counterparts, Wang says. So BL and the male vulnerability it displays empowers them to enjoy sex in a "safe way" until they're ready. </p></div><div><p>That sense of safety also comes from the level playing field in gay romance - it does not have the fixed gender roles and stereotypes present in heterosexual love stories. "The focus is entirely on the emotional dynamics between the characters, their vulnerabilities, and their psychological depth," Chicca says. </p></div><div><p>A sprinkle of sporting rivalry gives you the heady alchemy of why Heated Rivalry resonates with long-time BL fans.</p></div><div><p>"I get the tension and rivalry between the characters," Enid adds, "plus the romance that I love." </p></div><div><p></p><h2>The power of Boys' Love </h2><p></p></div><div><p>Boys' Love is often celebrated as a female-driven literary space, but increasingly queer writers and readers who feel underserved by mainstream culture are also engaging with the genre.</p></div><div><p>What really strikes a chord for queer audiences is not just the aspiration or fantasy, but how much these stories can blur into lived experience, says Dr Sam Chan, a lecturer in digital cultures exploring gender and sexuality at the University of Sydney.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9276/live/9b0d22d0-0819-11f1-b5e2-dd58fc65f0f6.jpg.webp" alt="Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams seen in a still from Heated Rivalry facing each other, head and shoulders, in a steamy shower scene."><span>Sabrina Lantos/HBO Max</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Storrie and Williams in one of Heated Rivalry's many steamy scenes</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>When they cannot find role models in real life, they hope they can see them in films or television, he explains. And when they discover those narratives, they see them "as some kind of power or resource for their lives". </p></div><div><p>"The first thing they think about is whether those narratives are authentic or not, whether [they] can help them in their life, or just make them feel better in a heteronormative conservative society."</p></div><div><p>The power of Boys' Love and Heated Rivalry lies in their ability to show what love could - and does - look like for those who live on the periphery. </p></div><div><p>It inspires in them the belief that they will one day build their own version of that cottage. It gives them what many underrepresented communities desire: hope.</p></div><div><p></p><h2>Gay romance (and sex) sells</h2><p></p></div><div><p>For decades, the Asian entertainment industry has recognised the market for Boys' Love. A wave of film and TV adaptations have brought what was once a niche genre into the spotlight.</p></div><div><p>In Thailand alone, it is a multi-million dollar industry, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationthailand.com/blogs/life/entertainment/40045102" rel="noopener noreferrer">projected</a> to generate more than 4.9 billion baht (£114m; $155m) by the end of 2025. </p></div><div><p>Chinese streaming platforms have optioned dozens of danmei novels, with the most expensive IP reportedly sold for 40 million yuan ($5.6 million; £4.1 million), launching the careers of some of the country's biggest stars.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2552/live/5744f8a0-07bc-11f1-9972-d3f265c101c6.jpg.webp" alt="Chicca Art/@chicca_art A fan drawing of Shane and Ilya from Heated Rivalry facing off in their hockey gear. Shane is on the left wearing a blue jersey and helmet and Ilya is on the left wearing a white jersey and helmet."><span>Chicca Art/@chicca_art</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Shane and Ilya face off in a recreation of Heated Rivalry's famous poster</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Unlike in Thailand, which recently legalised gay marriage, homosexuality is not as openly accepted in Japan and Korea - but that hasn't stopped an ardent social media following there from sharing stills, art and fan edits of Heated Rivalry's every frame in the thousands. </p></div><div><p>The show has not officially aired in Japan and South Korea, but dedicated linguists have translated star duo Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie's countless interviews into Korean.</p></div><div><p>The pair's palpable chemistry has also elevated them to idol-like status in Vietnam and the Philippines, with fans even buying out LED billboards and hosting Heated Rivalry-themed festivities to celebrate Williams and Storrie's birthdays.</p></div><div><p>In a time where <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lgbtq-representation-film-three-year-low-glaad-1236257646/" rel="noopener noreferrer">LGBTQ+ stories and diversity in Hollywood</a> have plummeted, Heated Rivalry's breakout success has unearthed the hunger for not only an unabashedly queer story, but also a universally, endearingly human one. </p></div><div><p>That hunger appears no closer to waning. With a second season of Heated Rivalry not due until 2027, fans are already flocking to the Boys' Love universe to tide them over during the drought. </p></div><div><p>A flurry of recommendations for BL shows and fiction have been exchanged across social media, with the hopes of recapturing the fervour Heated Rivalry ignited. </p></div><div><p>"Sometimes, it can be enough to just be able to see something you haven't experienced, or aren't ready to experience yet," says Anna. </p></div><div><p>"That's hopeful, and moving."</p></div></article></div></div>

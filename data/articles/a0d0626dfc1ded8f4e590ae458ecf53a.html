<p><img alt="Criminal IP + IBM QRadar integration" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/posts/2026/02/11/criminal-ip-ibm.jpg"></p>

<p>Criminal IP (criminalip.io), the AI-powered threat intelligence and attack surface intelligence platform, is now integrated with IBM QRadar SIEM and QRadar SOAR.</p>

<p>The integration brings external, IP-based threat intelligence directly into IBM QRadar’s detection, investigation, and response workflows, enabling security teams to identify malicious activity faster and prioritize response actions more effectively across SOC operations.</p>

<p>IBM QRadar is widely adopted by enterprises and public-sector organizations as a central platform for security monitoring, automation, and incident response.</p>

<p>By embedding Criminal IP intelligence into QRadar SIEM and extending it into SOAR workflows, organizations can apply external threat context across the incident lifecycle without leaving the QRadar environment.</p>

<h2>Real-Time Threat Visibility from Firewall Traffic Logs</h2>

<p>With the Criminal IP QRadar SIEM integration, security teams can analyze firewall traffic logs and automatically assess the risk associated with communicating IP addresses.</p>

<p>Traffic data forwarded into IBM QRadar SIEM is analyzed through the Criminal IP API and reflected directly inside the SIEM interface.</p>

<p>Observed IP addresses are automatically classified into High, Medium, or Low risk levels from a threat intelligence perspective.</p>

<p>This allows SOC teams to quickly identify high-risk IPs, monitor inbound and outbound traffic, and prioritize response actions such as access blocking or escalation within the familiar QRadar SIEM workflow.</p>

<p>Access Criminal IP's Threat Intelligence needed to proactively identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats.</p>

<p>Powered by AI and OSINT, it delivers threat scoring, reputation data, and real-time detection of a wide array of malicious indicators, ranging from C2 servers and IOCs to masking services like VPNs, proxies, and anonymous VPNs, across IPs, domains, and URLs. Its API-first architecture ensures seamless integration into security workflows to boost visibility, automation, and response.</p>

<h2>Interactive Investigation Without Leaving QRadar</h2>

<figure><img alt=" Integrated Criminal IP lookup within IBM QRadar SIEM enables analysts to investigate suspicious IPs directly from traffic logs." src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/security/c/criminal-ip/ibm-qradar/criminal-ip-integrated-ibm-qradar.jpg"><figcaption><strong>Integrated Criminal IP lookup within IBM QRadar SIEM enables analysts to investigate suspicious IPs directly from traffic logs.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Beyond high-level visibility, the integration supports fast, in-context investigation. Analysts can right-click on IP addresses displayed in QRadar Log Activity to open a detailed Criminal IP IP report.</p>

<p>These reports provide additional context, including threat indicators, historical behavior, and external exposure signals, enabling analysts to validate risk and intent without switching tools. This streamlined workflow supports faster decision-making during time-sensitive investigations.</p>

<h2>Extending Intelligence into QRadar SOAR Workflows</h2>

<p>Criminal IP is also integrated with IBM QRadar SOAR to support automated threat enrichment during incident response. Using pre-built playbooks, Criminal IP intelligence can be applied to IP address and URL artifacts, with enrichment results returned directly into SOAR cases as artifact hits or incident notes.</p>

<p>This integration includes two playbooks:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Criminal IP: IP Threat Service</strong> – Enriches IP address artifacts with Criminal IP threat context.</li>
	<li><strong>Criminal IP: URL Threat Service</strong> – Performs lite or full URL scans and returns results as artifact hits or incident notes.</li>
</ul><p>By embedding Criminal IP threat intelligence directly into SOAR workflows, analysts can reduce manual lookups and respond to incidents more efficiently.</p>

<h2>Advancing Intelligence-Driven Detection and Response</h2>

<p>By integrating Criminal IP with IBM QRadar SIEM and SOAR, organizations can combine QRadar’s correlation, investigation, and response capabilities with context-rich external threat intelligence derived from real-world internet exposure.</p>

<p>This approach improves detection accuracy, shortens investigation cycles, and enhances response prioritization across SOC operations.</p>

<p>As alert volumes continue to grow, Criminal IP helps QRadar users make faster, more informed decisions by bringing external threat context directly into SIEM and SOAR workflows without adding operational complexity.</p>

<p>AI SPERA CEO Byungtak Kang commented that the integration highlights the growing importance of real-time, exposure-based intelligence in modern SOC environments and underscores Criminal IP’s focus on improving detection confidence and operational efficiency through practical, intelligence-driven integrations.</p>

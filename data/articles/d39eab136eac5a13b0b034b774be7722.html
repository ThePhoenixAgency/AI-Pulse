Is that fair to say, Bill? …you are expert at Wikipedia.</p> </div> <div> <p>I will not deny it.</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>So it’s a yes?</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s a yes, but as I was saying before the show, the thing is, Wikipedia is so big that even the most veteran of veterans don’t know everything that happens there. So I will do the best I can, and if I don’t know, I’ll just say “That requires more research.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. It really is kind of like the eighth wonder of the world at this point. The fact that it exists, it’s so huge, it’s editable by anybody, it’s got all kinds of intrigue and politicking and interestingness around it… I mean, it really is a fascinating creation that exists in the digital world, isn’t it?</p> </div> <div> <p>There’s nothing else like it. For many years – I would say that even Google has competitors, even Amazon, I guess… Even Amazon has competitors, right? Walmart… But Wikipedia, until maybe, maybe very recently, if we want to go in this direction, there’s really there’s no other substitute. And so it’s also the thing that all of the other big tech giants can agree on, that they use it to underpin information… It’s the canonical source of information on the internet.</p> </div> <div> <p>What does it mean, practically, if you could just flex a little potentially right here at the top, what does it mean to be an expert, or a self-professed expert in Wikipedia? What does that mean?</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, gosh, probably everybody is self-professed if they say they are…</p> </div> <div> <p>Right.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s the same thing as being a Wikipedia editor in the first place. What does it mean to be a Wikipedian? Because to some extent, it is just you have an account, you make edits, you want to advance Wikipedia’s mission, and you just kind of demonstrate it day by day. And when it comes to being an expert - I mean, I guess you could ask my friends who are Wikipedia editors if I’m a Wikipedia expert, and I think they would say yes. That said, though, it is not hard – just like on Wikipedia, because it is so vast, it is diffuse, the community is very… The borders are porous. People come and go. You can just say you are, but then you have to back it up, and anyone can dispute anything. And I’m not an expert on certainly the technical side of how the squid servers work and all that, but… The community dynamics, the guidelines that underpin the content, that’s where I’m strongest.</p> </div> <div> <p>Does Wikipedia have things like RFCs, or specifications for how you – is there protocols that you can just like flex on and say “You know what? I know RFC 525, and on line seven it says X.”</p> </div> <div> <p>I mean, RFC is very much a thing on Wikipedia. It’s a request or comment. Is that what your RFC is?</p> </div> <div> <p>I think there’s a couple of different flavors of it, but pretty much. Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>So an RFC would be a formal call – semi-formal. Nothing is completely formal on Wikipedia. Call for editors to give comment on a difficult issue that editors are trying to resolve. And there certainly are policies that people will cite, and they’ll do so in shorthand… Probably one of the more famous rules is neutrality; the policy that says you have to write with a neutral point of view. And so the shorthand for that is wp:npov. Or oftentimes it’s just npov. And so if you’re in a discussion with Wikipedia editors and you drop some of these terms, that’s one way to demonstrate you are speaking the language.</p> </div> <div> <p>You’re in the know. You’re in the circle.</p> </div> <div> <p>Right.</p> </div> <div> <p>What are some other things? Npov makes sense… What are the other shorthand principles that all the editors know about?</p> </div> <div> <p>I’ll tell you one that’s even more obscure. Probably many people have learned about npov over time. I’ll give you another one that is used by editors really in the know, and that is called NOTHERE. All caps, N-O-T-H-E-R-E. And this is when you’re dealing with a problem editor. Wikipedia tries to give benefit of the doubt to new editors coming in; if they mess something up, you want to assume good faith. And there’s actually a policy that says “Assume good faith.” But at a certain point, that could be abused, and you have to no longer do that. And so NOTHERE is shorthand for “Not here to build an encyclopedia.” So if two veteran editors are discussing a third editor, and one says the other is not here, that is a signal that someone’s getting ready to break out the band hammer, or put someone on suspension.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:08:03.00">00:08:03.00</a>] What are the official rules? I know there’s something like no first-party sources, or like there’s specific things where if I’m just going to become an editor, I assume I go read a document that tells me “Here’s how it’s going to work.” Can you just lay the base foundation for how pages come to be, or edits come to be? Principally, not technically.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. Let me start with the superstructure of the rules, and we can get into some of the more specifics. So there’s not one document you’d be reading; it’s many, many documents. And when I got into Wikipedia, 20-some years ago, I was a much younger man then. I was single, and I had free time, and I would spend my hungover Sunday mornings just reading endless policy pages on Wikipedia.</p> </div> <div> <p>Because the hangover wasn’t bad enough for you? You had to submit yourself to more…?</p> </div> <div> <p>It slowed me down enough that I could just like read… They’re so long. These pages are so long.</p> </div> <div> <p>Okay.</p> </div> <div> <p>But there are policies that are absolutely mandatory. There are guidelines which are very strongly advisory. There’s even a third level of rule, and that would be essays, community essays where they describe perspective points of view, but they don’t necessarily carry the weight of a policy or a guideline. And so the policies tend to be focused on editor behavior, such as not creating multiple accounts, no sock puppetry, things like that neutral point of view… Some of the core policies are content-focused. But once you get outside those core policies into the guidelines, then you have things like “How do you write titles of nobility? Do you put spaces in between, say, the name J.R, like J.R. Ewing? Do you put spaces in between that?” Last time I checked on this - don’t come after me if it’s no longer the case, but yes, you always put spaces in between those two letters, even if the person themselves does not.</p> </div> <div> <p>How about the Oxford comma? Are they pro or against?</p> </div> <div> <p>I think more pro, but it’s also not uniform.</p> </div> <div> <p>Really?</p> </div> <div> <p>Because the site is so vast. Again, I reserve the right to be wrong on this one, but…</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s interesting, because the Associated Press has a similar nature. Is there any overlap between the Associated Press’s version of that and how it shows up in journalism, to Wikipedia’s?</p> </div> <div>
<p>There may be, but it would be more incidental. They’re not following Chicago style or anything like that. They’ve developed their own style over time. And by the way, another thing that they have to contend with is English comes in multiple flavors. There’s American English. There is British English. And so, for example – I’ll tell you what, some of my very earliest edits to Wikipedia back in the late aughts was changing British spellings in the articles about the Sopranos TV show back to English… Because the show had a huge following in the UK. And British editors really punch above their weight in terms of contributing to Wikipedia. But if it is an American subject, it should be written in American English, and vice versa.</p>
<p>By the way, if there is not a clear country of origin… Yogurt is one topic that there was an endless edit war many years ago about whether there should be an H in yogurt.</p> </div> <div> <p>There’s no H in yogurt… Is there an H in yogurt?</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, it depends on where you are. [laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>Like gas versus petrol. They say petrol over there. And I could be wrong, but the last I checked I thought it was still saying petrol. In that case, it’s just whoever created the page first, and now that was so long ago that no one remembers.</p> </div> <div>
<p>Crazy. And you actually created a company around this, because anytime you have a website as massive, that becomes kind of the standard of record. When things are on Wikipedia it doesn’t mean they’re true, but it means they’re at least vetted to a certain extent, and people accept it as true.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:12:03.24">00:12:03.24</a>] And so PR is a huge aspect of that, because you are in control of your page, or a topic’s page. If you’re a public figure, you want to be painted in a good light. Maybe you want a scandal hidden etc. If you’re a business, you may want to just maintain your reputation… I’m not saying you’re doing scandalous PR stuff. I’m not sure what you’re doing, but I assume you’re helping businesses engage correctly with Wikipedia. How’d you get into that?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, I mean, the last part is definitely correct. We help our clients influence how Wikipedia writes about them, but also while following the rules of engagement for PR. So my career goes back to the early 2000s. I was a political journalist early in my career, working in Washington D.C. And around this time, the political blogosphere, which - I don’t know if that even really still exists. It’s all kind of like coalesced into – Substack has kind of made a little bit of a comeback…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, true.</p> </div> <div>
<p>…but the political blogosphere was exerting influence, and so around 2004 I was writing a column about political blogging for this insider tips sheet, sort of like a forerunner of Politico. And - well, Wikipedia kept showing up in the blog posts… It was the one thing that editors of the left and right and center all seemed to agree on, that “This is an interesting resource that can help explain concepts, so I don’t have to write them out.” And I got out of journalism and went to go work at a public affairs firm, digital public affairs firm, and I was the person in the office who talked about Wikipedia the most, just because I thought it was fascinating… Although the truth of the matter is I’d never actually edited the site myself at this point in time. What I had done was I was going to try to stand up my own wiki site. And naturally, I was going to create Blogopedia. It was going to be a directory, an encyclopedia of all the blogs out there. This thing never got off the ground, and then one day the CEO of the company asked if I would make a change to his… He had a friend who’s a member of Congress. Would I make a change to his page? And so I kind of looked into it, I was like “Alright, he’s got a point here.” And I’ll tell you what I did first, that really did set the stage for the rest of it. And that was – like, I didn’t just go make the change… I kind of like read up on the policy, and then I went to the Talk page, the discussion section for that article, and explained what I was about to do. And then I did it, and it stuck. And I got a thank you from another editor for it.</p>
<p>I probably wouldn’t have done it exactly the same way today, but this was like showing some foresight, showing some kind of respect for the fact that other people had views about how things were done on Wikipedia… It put me in a good headspace to kind of diplomatically work through issues. And in particular, the company I worked for at the time, it had clients like – you know, one they had back then was Domino’s Pizza. And there’s this teeny tiny - scandal’s even the wrong word, but a negative news story from way back then, where someone at a Domino’s somewhere, an employee, was doing disgusting things with the pizza, like blowing snot into it, or whatever. And it made the news. So someone had added it to Wikipedia, it was it was true, it had a source in theory… That’s all you need for Wikipedia. But I was able to make the case that these were just some random, low-level employees. This was not something that had buy-in from the corporate structure. In fact, the company responded quickly. And I got editors to agree that, “You know what? This is trivial.” It was not something that needed to be in the Domino’s page.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:15:56.14">00:15:56.14</a>] And so that was probably one of the big a-ha moments, was if I make a good enough case, I can persuade editors that the Wikipedia article should say something different, in part, as you said, because it has the power… And even more so now than then, it has the power to affect the reputations of the subject it covers.</p> </div> <div> <p>Is there a maximum length, or there’s a point where it’s like – because you could just put everything about Domino’s you could possibly gather, and at a certain point it becomes too much information.</p> </div> <div> <p>Not here.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:16:28.28">00:16:28.28</a>] adding too much. Not here.</p> </div> <div> <p>How do you know when “not here” comes into play, and when just people have to make a call?</p> </div> <div> <p>I’ll tell you what, I don’t think they come into play there, because if you’re adding too much, you’re like here to build too much of an encyclopedia. And that’s –</p> </div> <div> <p>Too much.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s definitely such thing as too much. So there is answer to your question, and I believe it is around a hundred thousand bytes. There’s rarely hard and fast rules… This one says as an article gets closer to a hundred thousand bytes, you should consider splitting it. And so this is why you have articles that have like – there’s a parent article, and there will be a child article. There’ll be Microsoft is the article, then there is Criticism of Microsoft, which is - it could be nearly as long as the actual Microsoft article.</p> </div> <div>
<p>Well, they’ve been around so long… I mean, at a certain point there’s just a lot. There’s a lot of history for a lot of these - either whether it’s an organization, or a topic, or… I mean, it’s overwhelming sometimes to think about how you would even manage the information architecture of such a thing. And it sounds like it’s somewhat organic, and has grown over time…</p>
<p>How many editors are there? So we had a friend of ours, Andrew Nesbitt, on the show a couple of weeks ago, talking about ecosystems in open source, and how he found that when it came to certain popular open source packages, there are about 15,000 people who are kind of underpinning the entire software world, so to speak.</p>
<p>There’s the old trope from the XKCD comic, like it’s one person in Nebraska who’s like running all the dependencies… Well, it turns out 15,000 around the world is pretty close to that. And I think with Wikipedia, I assume there’s a – I don’t want to call them a cabal, but there’s got to be a core group of N editors who are kind of in charge. Do you know that number? Are you one of that group? Do you know that group?</p> </div> <div> <p>I am not personally in that group, but I know plenty of people in that group. It’s funny… Did you pull the word cabal out of thin air, or did you pull that from doing some reading?</p> </div> <div> <p>I just thought of it because it seemed like appropriate at the time…</p> </div> <div> <p>It is. Well, so there is even an essay on Wikipedia called “There is No Cabal.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, really?</p> </div> <div>
<p>And the reason why that essay exists is because – the cynical take on it is yeah, there’s not one cabal. There’s many cabals. And that meaning there are kind of groups of editors who will talk together offline. And offline coordination is frowned upon… But let’s not pretend it doesn’t happen. It can happen in good ways, it can happen in bad ways. I think it’s kind of value neutral.</p>
<p>But to your question about like – because it’s similar to the open source communities, for sure… Which it is - it’s an open to open knowledge community. Open source is certainly a component of it. I know it follows a power law, where there is a small number of highly active editors up at the very top, and a long tail of contributors who might contribute here and there.</p>
<p>So the numbers I’m going to give you are going to be very approximate, and they’re just kind of offered for demonstrative purposes, not to be quoted as accurate… And these numbers are very findable. But let’s say that there’s 3000 editors who are editing every single day, often hours a day. And they are really like the core group that keeps Wikipedia going. And a lot of them are not always writing the articles that you read. They are kind of arguing over policy, banning problem editors, and kind of working out kind of the structure of the behind the scenes; all the behind the scenes stuff, janitorial stuff at best. I don’t know about at best… But you know, Wikipedia has an arbitration committee that is sometimes considered to be Wikipedia’s Supreme Court… They’re in that 3000.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:20:18.25">00:20:18.25</a>] And you’ve got maybe 30,000 editors who are editing in a given month. I’m in that group. I don’t edit as often as I used to in the early years… And there’s also definitely a lifespan. There’s… I’m forgetting the term I’m looking for here, but like a course of events, where…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, like a lifecycle.</p> </div> <div> <p>Lifecycle. That is what I’m looking for. A lifecycle to being an editor, where you kind of get in, you get real excited, and you add a lot of material… And then you kind of like drift away, as you’ve already –</p> </div> <div> <p>Burn out.</p> </div> <div> <p>Burn out is totally one thing. Shared all the knowledge you wanted to share is another… There’s a lot of editors who really don’t create content. They just kind of shuffle around categories, and poke around here and there… And then to finish out the down at the long tail end, there’s about 100,000 editors who are - and this one I’m a little more certain about… There are 100,000 editors who make one edit, minimum one edit per month. And so that’s great, that it is really the people at the very top who are doing the most of it.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s kind of crazy. So going back to your work and how that works, how your work works, is like - when a company engages with you, do you then advise them how to engage with Wikipedia? Or is it like “Hey, we really want Bill’s edits, and he has clout…”? Because there’s like a clout system that’s just part of humanity, that’s built into this, as you edit, to a certain extent… Like “This guy’s reliable because he’s been not just doing this one company or this one topic… There’s clearly people that just come with their agenda, and then there’s people who are just there to edit and then they may also have it… There’s so many different angles.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>How do you tell brands to engage?</p> </div> <div>
<p>So we’ll do both, by the way, myself or members of our strategy team. We have a six-person strategy team. Or seven, I suppose… But folks who are working on Wikipedia all day, every day. And we will, using our disclosed business accounts that say “I’m Bill and I work at Beutler Inc, and my client is such and such, and I’d like to propose a change on this page.” We’ll do that. We also will coach our clients through leading outreach themselves. For large companies, where they have a corporate comms division, and they have more resources, they more – I don’t know if they have time for it, but they… Like, if a big company shows interest in Wikipedia and cares enough to put an employee on it, and share information, and talk with editors - that can be a good look. And so that is certainly a thing we do for certain, especially like Fortune 50 clients. But also, we will represent clients ourselves.</p>
<p>If you’re having us do it, then we’re going to decide what we’re going to be willing to ask for or not. If the company is the one who’s out there with the disclosure, it’s all on them. If they want to push a little harder on something that’s in the gray area, we might be willing to do that… But the fact is - yes, there is an aspect of reputation where we’re likely to get faster replies, myself or my colleagues, because editors will be more likely to recognize us. On the other hand though, there’s thousands of editors out there, and they don’t all know us. So there are projects where we work on the Talk page, communicating for a company, and we’ll be talking to editors we’ve never run across before. So there’s no – Wikipedia is all shades of gray. There’s never any one right way to do everything.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:23:55.02">00:23:55.02</a>] So a lot of sites or a lot of tech companies, because of their location and their employee base and stuff, they tend to lean to the left side of the political spectrum here in the United States. And there’s lots of claims that Wikipedia also is captive to that. And I’m curious your perspective from a “in the trenches” kind of guy who’s getting changes done… Do you see overwhelming political leanings, generally speaking, in Wikipedia? Do you think that that’s bonk? What are your thoughts on that?</p> </div> <div> <p>So the point about companies and their lean - I mean, they certainly did, I would say, in the Obama administration, Obama era… But especially now, in Trump too, I think that they kind of blow which way the winds are going.</p> </div> <div> <p>Sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>They’re very malleable. They’ll go where the dollars tell them they need to.</p> </div> <div> <p>Right. They have shareholder value to worry about.</p> </div> <div>
<p>A hundred percent. Wikipedia, I would say - and just for the record, I’m pretty centrist myself. I was a little more on the right when I was in my 20s, I’m a little centrist, not quite the left, in my 40s… But I’ve kind of seen the full gamut. And Wikipedia definitely has a center left, even maybe a little bit left bias. And I would say that that has something to do with the fact that a lot of the contributors, many have an academic background, and that obviously leans heavily left… They have journalistic values, which sometimes do have, often have at least, even if not, I would say, a left wing bias, they are at least parallel, there’s a parallel perspective there… That said, right now there’s probably more right wing criticism of Wikipedia than there has been in ever, really. And it’s been kind of rising over the last few years… And it’s not to say that there aren’t some decent criticisms of the handling of certain topics… But I think a lot of them kind of willfully misunderstand how Wikipedia uses sources.</p>
<p>So one of the big complaints would be “Well, we can’t use Breitbart, or The New York Post, or The Daily Mail to cite sources.” And kind of blow right past the fact that these are all publications that are not known for their journalistic scrutiny, integrity… No one’s going to flag you for using The Telegraph, or using the Wall Street Journal. But the fringier sources… And now there are more fringy sources on the right. I think there’s a whole interesting thing to be written, or many things to be written about why that’s the case. Why the right does not have kind of journalistic values as part of its animating values, and the left does more. That’s a huge topic, and it could be the rest of the show, if you want it to be. And I’ve written about this…</p> </div> <div> <p>I don’t want it to be. I just wanted to tiptoe into it and then move on, but…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>…this is an interesting perspective from you.</p> </div> <div> <p>I think the way to maybe approach that without going left, right or center is to talk about how power is distributed. Because you mentioned there’s no cabal, right? So if there’s no cabal, how is power distributed? How do you acquire power? How do editors squash other editors? How are there clicks? …things like that. I think that’s kind of like maybe a version, Jerod, of what you’re talking about… Because it’s not quite that, but it’s how do you leverage your own bias and your own power.</p> </div> <div>
<p>Yeah. I mean, you can definitely discuss it in terms that are not explicitly left/right political. There’s kind of a truism that if there is no visible hierarchy in an organization or a community, then it becomes an invisible hierarchy. And so that is 100 percent true at Wikipedia. And to my knowledge, nobody has ever, say, mapped out exactly what that looks like…</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:27:54.27">00:27:54.27</a>] If you were to look at Wikipedia’s own maintained list of the most active editors in Wikipedia, within that top 50 or so, you’re going to find some of those editors who are, just by virtue of being there all the time, the ones who they know the most policy, they have the most connections… And in certain topic areas - there are topic areas that do get captured by the contributors. Most of those are not necessarily the most active pages. A lot of times that’s in a little out of the way places where most editors don’t care to spend any time there… And so - you know what? When I talked about the rules of Wikipedia, I mentioned the policies and the guidelines. I didn’t mention that there are five pillars of Wikipedia, which are like Wikipedia’s encyclopedia, Wikipedia has no firm rules, etc. etc, things like that. There’s a sixth pillar that people sometimes refer to, and that is “The person who cares the most ends up getting their way.” [laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>Wow…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, it’s not perfect.</p> </div> <div> <p>That can be life sometimes, too. Yeah. Just like “Well, you care more than the rest of us, so go ahead, man… Just go ahead.” [laughs] That can be shaky when it comes to what’s true or not. Like, the person that cares the most gets their edit… It’s like “Well, how about the most truthful thing?” But when we all disagree about what’s true - I mean, those are really hard problems, aren’t they?</p> </div> <div>
<p>It is. I mean, you remember Stephen Colbert back in the early days of his Comedy Central Show coined a word… It was wikiality. And wikiality was – it’s the truth that we all agree on, because we just agreed with the case. And so it was couched as a criticism of Wikipedia, but also was more broadly intended to comment on shared delusions… In his case, he was definitely criticizing the American right… But certainly, shared delusions have no political home. They could be all over the place. And so there’s a bad version of that, and there’s a good version of that.</p>
<p>And one of the things about Wikipedia that I find really to be fascinating, probably one of the reasons why I got drawn to the project in the first place, was life does not have a black and white answers for many, many things. One plus one equals two, yes… But the right form of government is something that can change over time, even. As democracy works in the United States, it has had a harder time in other countries… It’s not because democracy itself is bad or wrong in some other place, it can be about what the culture around it is. And so there’s just no way that you can set it and forget it with Wikipedia, or with all the topics it covers. There’s no substitute for the daily task of rolling up your sleeves, getting in there, and making sure that things stay correct. And that’s why Wikipedia’s job will never be done. It’s an ideological informational battle that rages on around us, and never will go away. If it goes away, then there’s a problem. If Wikipedia calms down, that is when I get worried. As long as people are arguing about it, you know it’s healthy.</p> </div> <div> <p>So one of the things I’ve been telling people who don’t understand how all these new AI chatbots are doing what they do - just as a mental model, I know it’s not actually true. I just say “Just imagine that they’re kind of reading Wikipedia to you.” Like, they basically read the page so you don’t have to, and then they summarize it. I mean, obviously that’s a simplification and not always true, but certainly, these things have all read Wikipedia and continue to, right?</p> </div> <div> <p>That is probably the most succinct way of putting it, that they have read it, and continue to.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, I’m trying to think of like why it might go away, is because maybe there’s a demand for the information, but not for the website, so to speak.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>And then there becomes either a perverse or inverse incentive to even edit, if there’s no demand for the website. I mean, I feel like a lot of our internet underpinnings are kind of up in the air right now, of like “Where will they be in 10 years?” And I’m not so sure about Wikipedia. Because it’s certainly – it’s tantamount to these things right now, and new things they need. But why edit it if there’s no there there?</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s a really fascinating question, because it’s the conversation that Wikipedia editors are having themselves. And the foundation that runs Wikipedia also is very much focused on this issue. I am a little more bullish. I’ve been around for Wikipedia about 20 years, and I’ve seen many predictions of its demise.</p> </div> <div> <p>Okay.</p> </div> <div> <p>I remember I was even interviewed for an Economist story back in, I want to say like 2012… It was called WikiPeaks… You know, a play on WikiLeaks, but WikiPeaks. It was like a “Has it reached its zenith?” thing.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, that’s like a Twin Peaks thing. Okay. They peak of Wiki. Gotcha.</p> </div> <div> <p>Right. Or like Peak Oil, you know? That concept.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, exactly.</p> </div> <div> <p>And so I’ve seen – rumors of its death have been greatly exaggerated in the past. And I will say that I do think that the core community doesn’t do it for the clicks. They do it because it’s a hobby. It is something that – I oftentimes will liken editing Wikipedia, especially the people who are just recategorizing things, and kind of going about their way, just working through multiple articles and making the same kind of change over and over… It’s like knitting. It’s a repetitive, soothing…</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s a way to relax.</p> </div> <div>
<p>A hundred percent. I have friends who will sit down after a hard day’s work and just kind of click through the edit lists and make the same change, over, over, over. And there’s a weirdly satisfying thing in doing that. And that’s one mode of motivation for Wikipedia editors. Of course, there are many. And as long as Wikipedia itself continues to underpin what Google, what ChatGPT is putting out there, its influence is going to be continued.</p>
<p>I would say that because of the rise of AI search and the widespread awareness that AI has read, and continues to read - I love that formulation. I’m going to steal that.</p> </div> <div> <p>Please do.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:36:00.19">00:36:00.19</a>] Yeah. That it’s more important than it was two years ago. Or people have realized that, and so it’s more front of mind. So not to get too much into my business specifics, but this has been a really interesting year. It was kind of a rocky first half of the year, and I think that had something to do with the election, and brands kind of sitting on budgets, waiting to see… But then by the middle of the year, the AI – like, this is really the year, in multiple ways, where AI became part of business workflows. People had to figure out how to make use of it, even outside of technical circles. And so the second half of the year has been crazy for us. We really have not seen this kind of interest in a long time… Because all of a sudden there’s now – it’s not just Google as a driver. But that was historically the driver of clients to us, because Google relies on Wikipedia, it shows up at the top of some of these search results… Now there’s a whole second driver, and that’s ChatGPT.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s interesting to think about that though, because you’ve got these non-interfaces interfaces to Wikipedia… Like you said, the website not being there, Jerod. I think we still need – I think what you’re saying is we need this source of truth. I think so long as we have that centralized and societally elected source of truth, then Wikipedia still has a pretty good underpinning in terms of its foothold to being just that. I can’t imagine that the LLMs extracting that, and being trained on that supplants that, because you still need – those are distributed. You’ve got various frontier models. They’re not all controlled by one… And so they’re disparate sources of truth, if you want to call them that. And they’re really just copies of the truth, not the actual source.</p> </div> <div> <p>Right.</p> </div> <div> <p>I still value, personally - this is where I’m personally at… I still value the original database, which is Wikipedia. So I’m bullish as well.</p> </div> <div> <p>What if you’re extracted from that for 5 or 10 years? Are you still going to value that? Or are your kids going to value that?</p> </div> <div> <p>How do you mean?</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, your kids might not even know Wikipedia is back there, behind the scenes, doing its thing. Now, to your point - and I agree with you guys, that doesn’t mean that getting your information in there isn’t still important, because eventually it makes its way out of the GPTs, maybe. But they can also opt to not use your – so you’re kind of a degree of separation away from your edit actually being useful, because they may or may not use it in the final output. Whereas anybody who goes to the webpage, they’re going to read your sentence, as long as your sentence stays. Right?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>So there is like a decreased value of an editor for those who are not editing because it relaxes them, but they’re editing because they want some sort of –</p> </div> <div> <p>For truth, yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>I have no problem with people editing for self interest. The only edits I’ve ever made on Wikipedia was adding links to our podcast…</p> </div> <div> <p>For self-interest… [laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>No, it’s fine. Because we are a source of information. There’s a public figure on our show, they said something interesting, you go put it in the page, you get a link back to your podcast… Like, that’s self interest, but it also is adding value to the wiki. And so it’s totally fine. I’ve got no problem with that.</p> </div> <div> <p>Did those edits stay? Have they remained?</p> </div> <div> <p>I don’t know. Well, the problem was… I think I realized – I thought maybe they were going to be… They’re all no follow links, aren’t they? Like, every link is a no follow…</p> </div> <div> <p>They are no follow, but it’s still value being there.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. I think there’s still value being there. It was kind of like an ROI question of like how worth it is it for me to go be doing this, and the answer was “Well, maybe I should call Bill Beutler Inc. and have them do it for me… Because okay, my personal use - I never look at the sources very often. And when I do, I even less often click through to a source. So if it was a follow link, I would at least be getting Wikipedia juice, and I think that was worth it… But without that, I was kind of like “Meh…” And then I think I got one denied, and I was like “Well, this sucks.”</p> </div> <div> <p>I mean, this is why they no-follow it. Exactly.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:39:53.25">00:39:53.25</a>] Yeah. I understand why they no-follow it. It would be so many more edits if they didn’t. But yeah, I just kind of gave up. I think I did two or three, and I was like “This is not worth the squeeze.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. And this is why we work with SEO firms a lot less than we work with PR firms.</p> </div> <div> <p>That makes sense.</p> </div> <div> <p>PR firms trying to tell a story about a client, and SEO trying to push a website up. I will say, though, that’s starting to change just a little bit in this AEO, GEO era. The links between – actually, less adding links, and I’m thinking more of like creating links between pages to strengthen the relationship between, say, a client’s page and a concept they want to be associated with. I’m not saying we’re seeing a lot of that, but it’s just a conversation that comes up more often than it did for a long time, which is it almost never came up.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, here’s a sustainability question, because we’re in the current time of year when Wikipedia grants us the awesome “Please donate” button with a picture…</p> </div> <div> <p>They sure do.</p> </div> <div> <p>…and the sob story… Which, for my money, I’d rather you just charge for the website and not do that, but I understand. People have their opinions on it. I like the fact that it’s free for everybody, so I understand why they go the route they go… But you know, what Reddit does is they let everybody contribute to Reddit, and then they take all the information and they sell it to Open AI, to be trained on.</p> </div> <div> <p>And Reddit has advertising. It’s a for profit company, right?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, true.</p> </div> <div> <p>Whereas Wikipedia is not. Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, exactly. But they’re sustainable in that way. Like, they’re not just sustainable, they’re actually like profit-generating. Do you think that Wikipedia could potentially just – I mean, they are the world’s source of truth on many topics… Couldn’t they just charge the model trainers for that, and not have to – like, wouldn’t humanity better off if Open AI and Microsoft and Google were paying Wikipedia, and then they wouldn’t have to take donations?</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, they would have to change their license, their creative commons license, that - you can use it. Anybody is free to use anything on Wikipedia, remix it, even use it for commercial purposes… And all you have to do is say you got it from Wikipedia, and you’re covered. And that’s a very kind of liberal license that they have chosen. Copyleft, as opposed to copyright.</p> </div> <div> <p>Permissive.</p> </div> <div>
<p>Very permissive. It’s kind of like Jimmy Wales. Jimmy Wales was profiled in the New York Times magazine about a decade ago with the unfortunate kind of demeaning headline “Jimmy Wales is not an internet billionaire.” Among the people who’ve founded top 10 global websites, those guys are all billionaires many times over, with the exception of Jimmy Wales. And the problem is - and it’s not a problem, honestly. Jimmy Wales’ wisdom - his smart decision at the time was that if he had tried to add advertising and make it a for profit site and then limit it that way, it would not have become, not have grown to be what it is. You know, contributors really were drawn to the altruistic nature of it, in the sense that they were all kind of collecting all the world’s knowledge. If they were trying to if they were trying to monetize it, then the whole thing would collapse like a house of cards.</p>
<p>So this is still true today… If they were to start charging for it, they could – and then you know what? I should be careful. There is a one part of the Wikimedia Foundation that is charging for some parts of it. So the Wikimedia Enterprise is a for profits company inside the Wikimedia Foundation. And I guess I should say they were a one-time client of ours a few years ago. Not now. But I still have friends there. And they do offer up a professional version of the Wikimedia API, which is much more reliable, it has guaranteed uptimes, and an SLA… Which the regular Wikipedia API, which my firm does use for monitoring software that we built and maintain - it’s an unwieldy API.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:44:00.16">00:44:00.16</a>] As Wikipedia’s knowledge is useful, but untamed, so too is their free API… And so they’re never, however, going to charge, say, the AI companies for the main unvarnished product. But what they did do a few months ago was they did – like, the Wikimedia Foundation was annoyed with the big AI companies for putting strain on their servers by crawling the pages, using up a lot of their server time. And so what they did is they put out a couple of different cleaned up versions of it that they were like “Hi, Open AI. Hi, Anthropic. Please, please, please crawl this one. Don’t crawl our main site. We’ll give this one away for free. You can crawl it.” But they can’t, due to their licensing, force them to use it. They’re not charging for it. Does anybody use it? I don’t know the answer to that, and I’m not even sure the foundation knows the answer.</p>
<p>So there’s a lot of interesting questions like this that we won’t know the answer to, I suppose, for a long time. And to your question earlier about “Will people contribute if they don’t see the page show up in search results?”, so there’s not the same glory in their work being in the limelight of the top of Google search results. I will say that for the current generation of editors, for the people who built Wikipedia, that does not matter. They do it because they love it.</p>
<p>The real question - and this has been a conversation I’ve heard at a few Wikipedia conferences in the last few years, as Wikipedia approaches its 25th birthday anniversary in January… It’ll be celebrating 25. You know, the people who started Wikipedia - they are all 25 years older now. And obituaries for Wikipedia editors have been – I don’t know if it feels like it’s been getting more common. It would make sense, as they all get older…</p> </div> <div> <p>Sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>I know a handful of people who’ve been editors, who passed away, from even old age… And so the real question is, will there be the next generation of editors? Will they come on and continue the work? That is a source of anxiety, for sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, I don’t know the answer to that. I don’t think any of us do. I certainly know that Adam and I, and perhaps you are as well, Bill - we’re kind of raising up the next generation currently… And sometimes the ignorance of the way things work strikes me. And then I realize “Well, you’re their dad, Jerod. You’ve got to teach him about this stuff.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>But I think a lot of people don’t realize Wikipedia is user-generated content. They just think it’s like this encyclopedia that lives on their phone…</p> </div> <div> <p>Magically there…</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s just magically there. I mean –</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s like the Internet not being run by Linux, Jerod. It’s like the same question. I couldn’t believe that people don’t understand that the internet doesn’t run on Linux. Like, who doesn’t know that? Well, I guess a lot of people.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>A lot of people. So it doesn’t surprise me that this fact about Wikipedia is largely unknown by the general population. I mean, you’ve got harder issues in your life. Affording your mortgage, being able to actually even buy a house, affording the college degree you just got, or even being able to put your kids through college, or afford the grocery bill you just have to pay for. We were just shopping for groceries, and I was like, everything is up dramatically. Wow. Thanksgiving this year has gotta be like “Okay, all we can do is turkey and potato. That’s it. Okay?” I’m being facetious, but… My grocery bill this time, I was like “Wow, that’s dramatically more than I’m remembering.” So…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. Well, my son is four and a half years old… Adam, I heard you mentioned on a recent episode that your kiddo is doing one of those ninja classes…</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, yeah. He’s an up and coming ninja. He’s competing in everything. He’s loving it.</p> </div> <div> <p>Little Billy Beutler is also now a ninja in training, as of just a few weeks ago.</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] Nice.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:48:10.02">00:48:10.02</a>] Wow, good. Amazing.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. It’s super-fun.</p> </div> <div> <p>Especially at the age of four. I mean, if he keeps up with it… One, my son’s back is what I call swole, if that translates. I think it does.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, it does.</p> </div> <div> <p>And I’m like, “I’ve hugged this child for my whole entire life, and now when I hug him, I’m envious.” I’m like “Dang, man. I want my back to be swole like that.” You know?</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s never too late to become a ninja, Adam.</p> </div> <div> <p>I know. I know. [laughter]</p> </div> <div> <p>But yeah, will he edit Wikipedia? I mean, someone of his generation will, even if my son does not, exactly…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>You know, Jerod, you mentioned the point that it’s your job. I think that’s exactly why this kind of podcast exists, and also why we bleep all the curse words… Because we truly want to - and I guess for a while it’s been the hacker generation, but I guess it’s now becoming beyond just simply hacker, with shows like this… But I feel like that’s the job of content creators like us, and guests like you, to come on and share this truth, and this depth of our world, and the things that are important, and the reasons to show up and how to do them. Because if not, then who else is going to do it, besides the folks like us, who are in their 40s and nerds? That’s our job, righ?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s right.</p> </div> <div> <p>I mean, it’s more than a job for me. I got interested in Wikipedia before I realized that there was going to be a career in it for me. Certainly, at Beutler Inc, for the clients that we take on, the work that we do, one of our core values is just “Will our work make the encyclopedia better for its readers?” And one, I think that’s a good moral position to have… It also happens to have the advantage of like that’s what makes for successful projects. Editors will agree with us to make changes if what we bring to the table makes it better for the readers. That’s the thing. It’s like “Can Wikipedia service readers well?” And sometimes there are challenges where the rules themselves get in the way of making Wikipedia better. And I’ll give an example of a current one, with a client who’s a semi-retired venture capitalist who was divorced some years ago, but his Wikipedia page says he’s still married. And he’s like semi-retired. He’s not out there making news anymore… So what’s he going to do? Go do an interview just where he can say he’s divorced? He won’t do that. But there’s a novelist, the woman who wrote the novels the “Station Eleven” TV show is based on… She gave an interview to Slate back in 2012 to say “I’m not married anymore”, just so Wikipedia would change it.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, wow.</p> </div> <div> <p>So the fact that it’d be so hard to change things like that because of Wikipedia’s standard of sourcing… We couldn’t use the court documents to verify his marital status, for reasons that I could explain, but I don’t want to bore your audience. It’s like, Wikipedia runs into these limitations where trying to do the right thing can sometimes produce a worse encyclopedia.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. See, that I think is kind of weird. So at the risk of boring everybody, if there’s a court document that says that this thing is true, and Wikipedia’s desires to be a source of truth - or I’m not sure what the desires are; it seems like that would be what it is… It’s like “Well, you have evidence that this is true. Why is it invalid evidence? Like, what is the rule?”</p> </div> <div> <p>Alright, so I’ll cite some more policy at you… Let’s see. So there’s going to be the primary sources, there’s going to be the biography of living persons… And then there’s going to be another one that’s actually an essay, but it’s very influential. I’ll start with the essay. And this one really throws people for a loop oftentimes, that Wikipedia’s goal is verifiability, not truth. And this owes something to the fact that truth is a really difficult subject. Again, one plus one equals two - true. Matters of perspective - much harder to say what the truth is. So that’s one thing - Wikipedia is not a place to write down things that you know are true.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:52:24.28">00:52:24.28</a>] Verifiability is the most important thing.</p> </div> <div> <p>Verifiability.</p> </div> <div> <p>But isn’t a court document verifiability? Like, it’s a court document that says they got divorced.</p> </div> <div> <p>Here’s where we get to the primary sources part of it… Which is - there are primary sources, which would be court documents, government reports… Then there are secondary sources, which would be like news articles. The coverage of those primary sources. There’s also tertiary sources, of which Wikipedia is one, or a textbook would be, like compilations of compilations…</p> </div> <div> <p>Sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>Anyway, back to primary and secondary sources.</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s why he said it would bore us, Jerod. It’s like, he warned us.</p> </div> <div> <p>I’m not bored. Let’s go. I want to I want the answer. I want the answer.</p> </div> <div> <p>These are the core. Like, we’re really like seeing the matrix here in terms of how the wiki sausage gets made.</p> </div> <div> <p>There’s a show title for you…</p> </div> <div>
<p>Yeah, yeah. [laughter] Perfect. Wikipedia really, really, really wants to be based on secondary sources. Wikipedia editors don’t want to be in the position of arguing about interpretations of primary sources… Because there may be like a government transcript, like a Senate hearing. How do you decide which sentences of like a three-hour Senate hearing do you quote in a relevant article? So Wikipedia editors avoid arguing all of that by outsourcing those judgments to professional journalists who are covering that material, who have context for it, and who apply editorial judgment. So no one has applied an editorial judgment in this case to even say that the divorce was noteworthy in itself. I mean, it kind of like – here’s where it’s perverse. It does kind of defy logic that “If the article says he’s married now, and we have a court case that says that he is no longer married - we should be able to use that.” Right? So Wikipedia editors are thinking about “Well, if we apply this rule broadly, can that get us into trouble if you cite–”</p>
<p>So back to the third item, it’s the biography of a living persons policy. And that says for information about living persons, if the information is contentious or poorly sourced, it should be left out. So this would be – I don’t know if you would say this is contentious, but it is poorly sourced according to Wikipedia’s guidelines. And so you don’t want to be using primary sources to make claims about living people, that could affect their reputation… In most cases, it is used to keep from adding information to – like, let’s say the person got pulled over for a DUI, and it was not in the news, but you could find a court record of it… Does that need to be in there? Wikipedia editors would say “If it wasn’t in the press, then it wasn’t that important, so we don’t need to cover it.” Of course, if it was in the press, then it’s going to be added, and that could be hard to get out. But in this way – because this is kind of a perverse outcome, that it’s keeping Wikipedia from being fully accurate, because it is following rules that are well intentioned, and work out right most of the time… But then there are these edge cases.</p>
<p>And I will say, there is actually a very unpopular and a very little followed policy… It’s basically a dead letter today, that’s called “Ignore All Rules.” It says if the rules of Wikipedia are making it harder to improve the encyclopedia, then ignore the rules.</p> </div> <div> <p>I like that one.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:55:55.27">00:55:55.27</a>] It seems great. It seems like a good, helpful thing. But then you get back into applying editorial judgment calls, and I think here we are, Wikipedia being a quarter century old, everybody knows how important it is… There’s a lot of like caution around sticking your neck out. And so there are so many arguments about all kinds of issues, large and small in Wikipedia, that sometimes editors can be just cautious, and you know, if I don’t have to get involved in this thing, I don’t really care about it, I’m going to excuse myself from the conversation, or just never show up. I’ve been kind of working on this guy’s Talk page for a couple of years, and not constantly, but trying different angles every now and then, and still hasn’t got there.</p> </div> <div> <p>Is that to remove or to add?</p> </div> <div> <p>So I think that either one could be an acceptable outcome.</p> </div> <div> <p>Gotcha.</p> </div> <div>
<p>If we can, use the court record, which is publicly available, to say that he’s divorced, that would be fine. Also, the reason why he is notable has nothing to do with his family life. So you could remove that, and I think it would not affect the public’s understanding of this person’s accomplishments. Gotta get a Wikipedia editor who cares enough about it to see it my way. It hasn’t happened yet.</p>
<p><strong>Break</strong>: [<a href="#t=00:57:17.29">00:57:17.29</a>]</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s interesting, how your edits, given your depth and length there, still get pushed back by the non-cabal, that you said it’s not there…</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] That’s right.</p> </div> <div> <p>Because you’ve tried. You’re making attempts. You know the protocols, you know the RFCs, you know the rulings etc. The one piece of advice you could go back to is the one you gave before, which was go do some media coverage and just say it in media, and then you’ve got your golden ticket.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. I mean, I have yet to press the ignore all rules case. That’s sort of like the break glass in case of emergencies; it’s kind of the last ditch. And I might do that at some point, and almost more to kind of - I don’t want to say prove a point, because there is also a rule on Wikipedia that says “Don’t break the rules just to make a point.” That would be wp:point.</p> </div> <div> <p>I’m not a fan of people who say double click necessarily. I like those people, so I’m not going to say double click, I’m going to say zoom in, which is my other take on it… Can you zoom into the practicality of the edit? So you write it up, you submit the edit… How does that work? What is the interface you see? Is there a discussion possibility? Do you know the name of the editor who’s denying your request? Help me get into the double click version of that, if you don’t mind. I had to… I love those people, by the way. They’re the coolest double clickers.</p> </div> <div> <p>Wait, are you saying you love people who say double click [unintelligible <a href="#t=01:03:24.10">01:03:24.10</a>]</p> </div> <div> <p>Let’s double click in on that. Let’s close that tab.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s all you had to say, Adam, was double click on that [unintelligible <a href="#t=01:03:29.18">01:03:29.18</a>] Alright, Bill…</p> </div> <div> <p>Anyways…</p> </div> <div> <p>…what’s it feel like? What does it look like?</p> </div> <div>
<p>We’re zooming in now, and double clicking… You know, every Wikipedia article that you read, every page that’s part of the encyclopedia has right behind it, metaphorically speaking, a Talk page. This is the place where Wikipedia editors hash out their disagreements, and this is where as a paid editor, as a conflict of interest contributor, this is where I am invited to come participate. They don’t really want me making direct changes, and that’s fine. As long as I can get a fair hearing, no problem with that. That can be a bit of an issue sometimes.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=01:04:11.03">01:04:11.03</a>] You go to the Talk page, and you get the top of the page, you can click Add Topic, or Edit This Page. In terms of what you see, Wikipedia has a markup editor, Wikitext. It’s kind of like HTML, it has certain code that’s similar… It’s very simple coding language, markup language, which I’m pretty proficient in, my team is proficient in. But there is also a visual editor that they rolled out many years ago, where you can do a WYSIWYG version. It’s not as powerful, but for most purposes it’s suitable.</p>
<p>We’ll use the markup editor, and we will write a message, [unintelligible <a href="#t=01:04:53.10">01:04:53.10</a>] write an explanation of “Here’s what I want to change. Here’s why. Here’s what I think it should change to.” I will cite policies and guidelines that are relevant, but I also don’t want to overdo it. I trust that editors can see through the way that I am writing, that they know that I’m not some rando off the street, but I know what Wikipedia’s rules are all about… And I try to make a – start off like a simple request that is kind of undeniable, fact-based edit requests, much easier to make than… Again, matters of perspective are more challenging. And I embed links to the relevant section of the page I want to change, and all that.</p>
<p>I will even put into like block quotes with formatting to make it as legible as possible. So people can go look me up and find my user account and see me doing this. It’s all public. Obscure, but public. And then I add four squiggly – four tildes at the end, and that applies my signature. I hit Preview, check it… I hit Preview several times, just to get it just right.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>You guys wanted to double click… We’re like triple clicking now.</p> </div> <div> <p>Triple click. Is it now a thing?</p> </div> <div> <p>A triple tilde, at this point.</p> </div> <div> <p>Triple tilde clicks, and all.</p> </div> <div> <p>Quadruple tilde. If you do a triple tilde, it’s going to leave off the date. But you want to have the timestamp there.</p> </div> <div> <p>And they’ll know you’re a [unintelligible <a href="#t=01:06:22.16">01:06:22.16</a>]</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s better…</p> </div> <div> <p>Bro, do you even wiki?</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>And I hit Publish. And then – do you know what else I do, actually? This is a tip for anybody who themselves is representing a brand and wants to actually get someone to reply to their request eventually… It’s to add a template to the top of the message, below the heading, above the body of the message… It’s the Edit COI template. It opens up – do you know those squiggly brackets? You open with two squiggly brackets, you write Edit COI, and then you close up two squiggly brackets… And it creates a template that says “The user writing below has asked someone to review this change, because they have a conflict of interest.” And this puts your request into a queue on another part of the site, where volunteer editors who are interested in reviewing paid editor requests, which is too few editors from my perspective, of course… It’s just not what editors got into Wikipedia to do in the first place. Some people do find it fun, but not enough. And it can be a pain in the ass. My team takes pride in getting right to the point, not wasting anybody’s time, not asking for things that you can’t have. I almost cut myself there. And not everybody does. A lot of people will show up and try to do it, and they don’t really know how to ask, or they’ll write like a big wall of text that makes it – if it’s TL;DR, your request will sit there for a long time. As it is, your request will probably sit there for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks anyway, just because of the backlog, and because it does not work in chronological or reverse chronological order. There’s no first in/last out. It’s like, people just grab the edits, like “Oh, that’s interesting.”</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=01:08:23.02">01:08:23.02</a>] So it could sit there for a long time if it’s not of interest to somebody.</p> </div> <div> <p>You know what? I actually happen to have the page – okay, here we go. There are currently 243 requests as of <a href="#t=4:07">4:07</a> PM Eastern on November 19th, 2025. That’s higher than I’ve seen it in a while. Probably not the highest it’s ever been…</p> </div> <div> <p>407?</p> </div> <div> <p>243 open edit requests. Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>243.</p> </div> <div> <p>For paid edit requests. Yeah. Where somebody asking about their brand, their boss, their employer, their client.</p> </div> <div> <p>I see.</p> </div> <div> <p>Is that worldwide, or is that coming from your firm specifically?</p> </div> <div> <p>Worldwide for the –</p> </div> <div> <p>For the paid.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, so it is the edit request queue for the Edit COI template, COI being conflicts of interest.</p> </div> <div> <p>Gotcha.</p> </div> <div> <p>So it’s worldwide for the English language. Wikipedia has many different language editions. English is by far the largest and the one that gets the most attention. This is where the significant majority of our work is done. We do some work in other languages, but Wikipedia is the one that people in other countries care about. The business language of India is English. So that’s the Wikipedia that Indians care about.</p> </div> <div> <p>So if you had to get the editor’s interest, is there the equivalent of edit bait? Like, something you can put in there where it’s like “Hey, this is going to be a fun one for you to review” or anything like that?</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s a really good question. I don’t think I have a good answer for it, because we’re not choosing, for the most part… We will take on clients that we think have a good point to make, and that we are willing to work for… And the things they want to change are the things that they ask for, that we agree are feasible. So probably the closest thing would be if we have a client with a page that needs a lot of work, we will start off – I said a version of this earlier. We’ll start off with something real simple. We don’t want to barge in and ask “Can you change the most controversial element of this page?” We want to start off with something that everybody could agree on. Let’s let’s build some trust. Let’s show that we’re here, that we are here to build the encyclopedia, even though we’re doing so from a paid perspective. That’s about the best I could say.</p> </div> <div> <p>What about bad actors? I’m sure as a contributor you’re not necessarily the one who’s charged with this, but certainly, there are people that aren’t like yourselves. Even if you have conflicts of interest, you’re trying to make the encyclopedia better. There’s people that are trying to destroy it, there’s people that are trying to defame it, there’s people that are trying to just completely take over certain pages, certain topics, spam…</p> </div> <div> <p>Right. Promote themselves, win an argument… Those are the –</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, there’s tons of interests that are against the betterment of the encyclopedia. How does that usually play out?</p> </div> <div>
<p>So there is another group of editors - it sometimes overlaps with the editors who answer edit requests from the disclosed rule following paid editors like my team… But there is another group that runs a page which is worth a look. It could be fascinating. It’s called “The conflict of interest notice board”. This is where editors will go to report what they see as suspicious activity. Like “I’ve seen the pattern of edits on this editor. They’ve made 30 edits and they’re all to this one businessman. That’s a crystal clear pattern that this is someone working for that businessman.”</p>
<p>And so editors will go in and investigate, and they may roll back edits… They usually will not just block someone for conflict of interest editing… And some of this has to do with that fear that we won’t have editors in the future. Anybody who chooses to open up the browser window and make an edit, even if it is not immediately constructive, is a better bet to become a Wikipedia editor down the line than someone who’s never edited in the first place. It’s kind of the same principle why you buy a pair of shoes on the internet, on Amazon, and then the ads follow you around for the next couple of days, asking you to buy shoes again. If you’ve already shown interest in this topic, you’re more likely to buy that thing, even if “I just did that. Don’t show me shoe ads.”</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=01:12:35.28">01:12:35.28</a>] Well, I have a friend who is a longtime Wikipedia editor, and her very first edit to Wikipedia was vandalizing it, because she thought it was funny. She was also a teenager at the time, and a lot of people don’t realize, “Wow, I actually was able to edit this, and it went live.” That little a-ha moment… Sometimes people show up and they don’t know what they’re doing… They might write a page about their best friend to impress their best friend. And then the page gets taken down, but they’re like “Oh. Well, what else could I do?” At least that’s what they’re hoping for.</p> </div> <div> <p>How does a page become a page, and how does a page not become a page? I assume it’s similar to an edit, but it’s like a much bigger thing, because now it’s like, this deserves a page. I think that’s probably a bigger decision than “This sentence should be modified.” Or maybe it’s the same exact rules. How does that work?</p> </div> <div>
<p>Yeah. If we’re talking about regular Wikipedians who are contributing without any kind of conflict of interest, they can just like click on – like, if you see a red link on Wikipedia… You see fewer of them today than you did years ago, but a red link on Wikipedia means there’s no page behind that. You could click on that and just start creating the page. Or you could figure out how to create the new space and post it up. If you don’t really understand how all that works, or if you have a financial interest in the topic, there’s a project you can go to called Articles for Creation. This too has quite the backlog, but this is where you could write a draft entry and submit it for volunteer editors to review. And if you hit all the right points, if the subject is notable - and that’s the term of art on Wikipedia, because there’s a guideline called Notability. That’s a whole kettle of fish. If you want to get into it, we can. And if it’s approved, it goes on the live encyclopedia… Where it stays presumably forever, as long as it continues to be deemed notable.</p>
<p>But yes, articles are deleted too, either because they were never notable in the first place, or… That’s usually the main reason. The idea is once notable, always notable. But also, standards shift, opinions shift, and so there’s a process also called “Articles for deletion”, funny enough. And that’s also a really fascinating one to follow, because boy, that can get emotional. And people can come in and like try to desperately beg “Please, please leave my Wikipedia article.” And “Look here, I got mentioned in all these news articles.” And a lot of those mentions, they might not be the kind of sources or the kind of mentions – like, Wikipedia wants to have articles about, say, businesses that have really received true public attention, and not just within the industry vertical, a niche, but has been covered by major press more than once. Profile pieces, not passing mentions, and not like showing up in a listicle, or certainly not a paid placement.</p>
<p>The Forbes Contributor Network and all those blogs - a lot of them really are well-written and they look professional, but Wikipedia will not accept Forbes contributor pieces. If it’s from the magazine, now we’re talking. But if it’s from the Forbes Contributor - it’s an unpaid blog, really. Not truly professional, it has not been fact-checked or edited…</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=01:16:08.13">01:16:08.13</a>] And so yeah, deletion of pages – at my company, we do sell a service that is creating pages. We’re very selective about whom we sell it to, because we don’t want to sell something we can’t deliver on. And that’s a real challenge. We don’t really sell a service that’s saving your page from deletion. We’ll be like “This will run its course in two weeks. If it survives, we can help you improve it. But if it’s not, then you probably need more sources.”</p> </div> <div> <p>I think it’s kind of wild that – I’m assuming that there’s a lot of PR companies like yours… How many would you say there are in the world, that are like you?</p> </div> <div> <p>You mean the focus on Wikipedia?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div>
<p>So there is a very limited universe of what I would call guideline-compliant, rule-following… It’s like, on one hand I can count the number of agencies that do what we do. And we were the first. I started the company back in 2010. There are a handful of big PR firms that have someone on staff who does this work credibly… But then here’s one of the challenges of operating in this space - if you were just to go do a Google search for “Wikipedia help”, or “Wikipedia editor for hire”, “how to create a Wikipedia page”, you’re going to find these really hard sell, aggressive, fly by night companies that many of them are the same person, or small network, operating overseas… They will offer “100 percent guaranteed results”, and they will claim to have all kinds of testimonials, but they’re never from real people. And they will take your money and run. And at best, they will do – at best, they’ll take your money and run. At worst, they might create a page you hate, and then create an issue.</p>
<p>And I guess there’s a middle category. There’s a handful of agencies that will do this work, and they’ll either claim to be following the rules, but I’ve seen their work. I know they’re not. Or they just hope their clients don’t know any better. Because Wikipedia is still an esoteric thing. But clients don’t know what the rules of engagement are… So that’s sort of three categories, and we’re in the smallest one.</p> </div> <div> <p>I guess – I don’t really have a question, but more like an area where I’m hovering here, because I’m thinking… I’m back to like Jimmy Wales is not a billionaire… Maybe you’ve got a large swath of PR folks like you all, some that are credible, some that are less credible… But certainly a cottage industry of economics around editing and contributing to Wikipedia. And I’m just thinking like how that plays out in terms of maybe - do you all even give back to Wikipedia as part of your revenue model to maintain the source of truth being there? And I guess just the – again, not really a question, but just more around the economics of it… Because you guys are making money. Jimmy’s not making billions [unintelligible <a href="#t=01:19:18.14">01:19:18.14</a>] I don’t know.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. The money doesn’t go to him anyway, would it?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, don’t cry for Jimmy. He’s doing well.</p> </div> <div> <p>I’m getting asked right now to donate two bucks, or something like that, to Wikipedia. I don’t know, I’m just looking at the economics around Wikipedia; I’m like zooming into that, I suppose.</p> </div> <div> <p>Double-clicking.</p> </div> <div> <p>No double clicks.</p> </div> <div>
<p>[<a href="#t=01:19:40.11">01:19:40.11</a>] The topic of fundraising came up earlier, and I didn’t really go at it. Wikipedia - it’s about to be donation season again, fundraising season… And that hard sell, their own hard sell that you mentioned is contentious among Wikipedia editors. And not just because the money doesn’t go to them. It does not go to them, of course… But because Wikipedia – those fundraisers are extremely successful. Wikipedia’s budget is like 100 million dollars every year. And they raise what they spend, and it goes in and out, and there are over 100 employees, not counting contractors at the foundation… And it’s not clear that a lot of the work they do actually makes the encyclopedia better. It’s almost kind of its own thing. It’s this NGO that is – I don’t know, conservatives would say that it supports woke causes. And that’s an interesting thing to unpack. But a lot of it is just trying to improve the ecosystem of editors, but the money – it’s difficult to spend the money well, because they can’t directly pay for content. That’s in their charter as well.</p>
<p>So editors in the past have – a couple of years ago there was an editor revolt of sorts, where they pressured the foundation to tone down some of that alarmist rhetoric about how Wikipedia will go away. And guess what? The fundraising tanked that year, and they had to lay off a bunch of people. And I mentioned that Wikimedia Enterprise was a client of ours… That was really the reason why they had to let us go, because they didn’t [unintelligible <a href="#t=01:21:22.03">01:21:22.03</a>] I hope they don’t get mad about me saying that if they hear this. No hard feelings, truly, but… I mean, that is what happened.</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] Now it’s clear.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, now it’s clear. The truth comes out, an hour and 15 in…</p> </div> <div> <p>Ha-hah! Get the transcript, put it on Wikipedia.</p> </div> <div> <p>Right. The economics, though. I wanna get to the economics, or the ecosystem. So I have wished in the past that Wikipedia had developed an ecosystem like, say, Linux. And I’ve tried making this argument in the past, that there’s no such thing as the Red Hat of Wikipedia. If there was, I think we would be it. But there is this – and this also gets to Wikipedia having kind of like a left-leaning disposition… I’ve mentioned the academics, but there is also kind of an anti-corporate atmosphere around Wikipedia, which is a principle challenge to the work that we do, but it’s also a reason why our service is viable to begin with… Because it is difficult to work on company topics.

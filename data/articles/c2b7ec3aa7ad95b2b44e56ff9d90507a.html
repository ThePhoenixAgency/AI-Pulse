    <pre><code>Apple has four products showing signs of being discontinued imminently, with supply reportedly drying up at the Apple Store ahead of successors launching soon. iPhone 16e Last February, Apple launched the iPhone 16e as a new budget-friendly model. But all signs point to the iPhone being discontinued shortly as the iPhone 17e nears. Per Mark Gurman in a post on X, Apple retail employees tell him that inventory of the iPhone 16e has “basically dried out.” With the iPhone 17e launch expected in the next couple of weeks, it seems Apple has no plans for the iPhone 16e to stick around at a lower price point. Instead, it will be completely discontinued. M3 iPad Air Apple’s M3 iPad Air launched last March, and rumors increasingly indicate that its successor is almost here. A new M4 iPad Air is in the works, with a launch expected in the weeks ahead. And like the iPhone 16e, existing inventory of the M3 iPad Air seems to be running short. Mark Gurman wrote last night that “the iPad Air is seeing shortages as well. I’ve been expecting new versions of both (iPhone 17e and M4 iPad Air) in the coming weeks.” Apple Studio Display It’s been four years since the first Apple Studio Display arrived. But the long wait for a new model is nearly over. Per Bloomberg, the current Studio Display is showing signs of an imminent refresh: Apple’s entry-level Studio Display is also in short supply, both online and in stores, with new shipments not expected until late February or early March. Dwindling supply is a strong indication of what we already suspected: that Apple’s new Studio Display will lead to the discontinuation of the current model. MacBook Pro with M4 Pro and M4 Max The MacBook Pro is currently offered with three different chip options spanning two generations. You can buy: MacBook Pro with M5 MacBook Pro with M4 Pro MacBook Pro with M4 Max But soon, those M4 models are expected to be replaced by new M5 Pro and M5 Max versions. Bloomberg reported this week that “M4 versions of the high-end laptops remain in short supply, a telltale sign that new models are coming.” The report says Apple has a product launch planned for “as early as the week of March 2,” but prior rumors indicated the new MacBook Pros could arrive even sooner.

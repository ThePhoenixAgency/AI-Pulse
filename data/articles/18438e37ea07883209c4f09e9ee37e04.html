<p>Spotify has started rolling out another round of price increases in the United States, and the timing has opened the door for a public jab from Apple Music. As February <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/spotify-price-increase-starts-this-month-for-premium-users/">renewals begin at higher rates</a>, Apple Music has taken to social media to remind subscribers that its pricing has not changed. At the same time, it is promoting a limited three-month free trial.</p>



<p>Last month, Spotify <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/spotify-raises-us-subscription-prices-again-with-increases-across-all-premium-plans/">confirmed</a> that several of its plans would cost more. The new pricing now affects Premium, Duo, Family, and Student subscribers. The company says the increase will help it “keep delivering a great experience.”</p>



<p>According to Spotify, the updated monthly prices in the United States are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Spotify Premium</strong>: $12.99, up from $11.99</li>



<li><strong>Spotify Duo</strong>: $18.99, up from $16.99</li>



<li><strong>Spotify Family</strong>: $21.99, up from $19.99</li>



<li><strong>Spotify Student</strong>: $6.99, up from $5.99</li>
</ul>



<p>Spotify last raised prices in June 2024, when Premium moved from $10.99 to $11.99. Before that, the service increased its standard plan in 2023 from $9.99 to $10.99, marking its first price hike.</p>



<h2>Apple Music Responds Publicly</h2>

<p>As subscribers reacted online to the new Spotify rates, Apple Music stepped in with a pointed message. On X, Apple Music <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/AppleMusic/status/2022453948901400589">posted</a>, “<strong>BTW, we’re still the same price</strong>.” The message clearly targeted users frustrated by the increase.</p>



<p>In another post, Apple Music added, “<strong>Breaking up is hard… unless they don’t have Spatial Audio</strong>.” It followed that with a third message aimed at switching users: “<strong>Ready to move on? Bring everything with you… even your playlists. Try 3 months on us. Terms apply. Don’t look back</strong>.”</p>



<p>Apple Music currently charges the following monthly prices in the United States:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Apple Music Individual</strong>: $10.99 per month</li>



<li><strong>Apple Music Family</strong>: $16.99 per month</li>



<li><strong>Apple Music Student</strong>: $5.99 per month</li>
</ul>



<p>Apple Music currently charges $10.99 per month for its Individual plan. The Family plan costs $16.99 per month, and the Student plan costs $5.99 per month. Apple raised its price once in October 2022, moving the Individual plan from $9.99 to $10.99. It has not changed pricing since then.</p>



<p>That leaves a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/spotify-price-increase-vs-apple-music-price-compared/">clear gap between the two services</a>. Spotify Premium now costs $2 more per month than Apple Music’s Individual plan. The difference is even wider for families, where Spotify charges $21.99 compared to Apple Music’s $16.99.</p>



<p>Apple Music is also offering a free three-month trial until February 24. In addition, the service comes bundled in Apple One plans, which include Apple TV, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+.</p>



<p>With Spotify’s latest increase now in effect, pricing has become a central part of the streaming competition again. Apple Music has chosen to highlight stability and value, while Spotify argues that the higher rates support a better experience. Subscribers will decide which approach matters more.</p>

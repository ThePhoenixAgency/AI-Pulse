    <pre><code>From 10h agoTrump is 'deeply committed to your success', Rubio tells OrbánRubio said the personal connection between Trump and Orbán is behind the strong relationship between the US and Hungary. He said: We are entering this golden era of relations between our countries and not simply because of the alignment of our people. But because of the relationship that you have with the President of the United States. I don’t think it is any mystery and it should not be a mystery to anyone here how the president feels about you, how he interacted with you in his first term as president and now in his second term as president that relationship has grown even closer … I can say to you with confidence that President Trump is deeply committed to your success. Because your success is our success. Because this relationship we have here in central Europe through you is so essential and vital for our national interests in the years to come. If you face financial struggles, if you face things that are impediments to growth, if you face things that threaten the stability of your country, I know that President Trump would be very interested because of your relationship with him and because of the importance of this country to us.

At a news conference in Budapest, Rubio said US-Hungary relations - which both he and Orbán described as experiencing a “golden age” under Trump - go beyond mere diplomatic cooperation. “I’m going to be very blunt with you,” Rubio said. “The prime minister and the president have a very, very close personal relationship and working relationship, and I think it has been beneficial to our two countries.” German finance minister Lars Klingbeil said on Monday the European Union was at a turning point in which countries should not hide behind national interests but accelerate progress to strengthen EU influence and sovereignty. “We want to cut through knots, we want to find solutions always with the goal of strengthening Europe’s sovereignty and making Europe strong,” Klingbeil said in Brussels. “This is a very European moment.” Germany’s foreign minister Johann Wadephul suggested that France needs to boost its defence spending. “He repeatedly and correctly refers to our pursuit of European sovereignty,” Wadephul said of French president Emmanuel Macron. “Anyone who talks about it needs to act accordingly in their own country.” The Kremlin has dismissed assessments from five European countries that concluded that the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a poison developed from a dart frog toxin administered by the Russian state two years ago. The assessment was made from the foreign ministries of the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands after analysis of material samples found on Navalny’s body. Senior Ukrainian and Russian officials are to meet this week in Switzerland for a second round of talks brokered by the Trump administration, days before the fourth anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The two-day meeting, kicking off on Tuesday, is expected to mirror negotiations held earlier this month in Abu Dhabi, with representatives from Washington, Kyiv and Moscow in attendance. Avalanches from heavy snowfall in the European Alps claimed more lives over the weekend, as a train was derailed by a snow slide in Switzerland on Monday and roads and villages around Mont Blanc were closed or placed under evacuation orders. As large areas of the western Alps remained under a high risk of avalanche – following a week in which alerts reached category 5, the highest level – Swiss police said a train derailment caused by an avalanche injured five people near the town of Goppenstein. Authorities in Cyprus have urged residents to reduce their water intake by 10% – the equivalent of two minutes’ use of running water each day – as Europe’s most south-easterly nation grapples with a once-in-a century drought. The appeal, announced alongside a €31m (£27m) package of emergency measures, comes as reservoirs hit record lows with little prospect of replenishment before the tourist season starts. Spain announced earlier this month that it would seek to ban under-16s from using social media platforms, following Australia’s ban for under-16s in December and French lawmakers passing a bill that would ban social media use by under-15s. To enforce the ban, the Spanish government will reportedly seek to order platforms to put stringent age verification methods in place.

Times are critical and every drop now counts.”It was, she told the Guardian, the Mediterranean island’s worst drought in living memory with dam inflows at their lowest since 1901, when hydrological records first begun. Vast tracts of land across the country have been baked dry, with prime forest areas desiccated and dying fast.As other parts of Europe have this winter been lashed by rain, the sight of the church of St Nicholas in the Kouris reservoir, where water levels are reported to have dropped to just 12.2% of capacity, offered further proof of the worsening crisis.Donald Trump is committed to the success of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán because his leadership is crucial for US national interests, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has said.“President Trump is deeply committed to your success, because your success is our success,” Rubio said, standing next to Orbán at a joint press conference in Budapest.Taking questions from journalists, Rubio also said that the US seemed to be the “only nation on Earth” that can get Ukrainian and Russian representatives “to the table to talk” to try to bring an end to the war.Trump is committed to Hungarian PM Orbán's success, says Rubio – videoSpain announced earlier this month that it would seek to ban under-16s from using social media platforms, following Australia’s ban for under-16s in December and French lawmakers passing a bill that would ban social media use by under-15s.To enforce the ban, the Spanish government will reportedly seek to order platforms to put stringent age verification methods in place.Similarly, the Danish government announced last year it had secured an agreement in parliament to ban access to social media for under-15s.The flurry of legislative activity is in response to growing concerns about young people’s mental health, ability to concentrate and their easy access to harmful content online.Australia’s under-16s have lost their access to major digital platforms.

The Albertville prosecutor, Benoît Bachelet, said the ski instructor, who avoided injury, tested negative after taking blood and drug tests. He added that another British person had sustained minor injuries.In another incident on Sunday, an avalanche claimed the lives of two skiers on the Italian side of Mont Blanc.The incident occurred about 11.00am in the Couloir Vesses, a popular off-piste route in Courmayeur, located in the upper Val Veny, near the border with France and Switzerland.The incidents come on top of the record 13 off-piste skiers, climbers and hikers who died in the Italian mountains over a week ending 8 February, Alpine Rescue said last Monday, including 10 in avalanches triggered by an exceptionally unstable snowpack.Luke HardingSenior Ukrainian and Russian officials are to meet this week in Switzerland for a second round of talks brokered by the Trump administration, days before the fourth anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The two-day meeting, kicking off on Tuesday, is expected to mirror negotiations held earlier this month in Abu Dhabi, with representatives from Washington, Kyiv and Moscow in attendance. Despite renewed US efforts to revive diplomacy, hopes for any sudden breakthrough remain low, with Russia continuing to press maximalist demands on Ukraine.While the Abu Dhabi discussions were largely focused on military ceasefire proposals, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday the Geneva talks would address a “broader range of issues”, including territorial questions and other demands put forward by Moscow.Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a meeting with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.

He will be joined by Igor Kostyukov, the chief of Russian military intelligence, and the deputy foreign minister Mikhail Galuzin, among nearly two dozen officials, Moscow has said. Ukraine is expected to send the same delegation as in earlier rounds, to be led in Geneva by Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council.The choice of Switzerland marks the first time the talks will be held on European soil after earlier rounds in Abu Dhabi and Istanbul.The choice of Geneva appears to have been pushed by Washington. The Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who are expected to lead US engagement with Russia and Ukraine, are scheduled to hold separate meetings with Iranian officials in the city later this week.Talks between German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron over creating a joint European nuclear deterrent are at an early stage and not aimed at diminishing the role of the US, a German government spokesperson was quoted by the Reuters news agency as having said earlier today.“The aim of the talks is to explore how closer cooperation on nuclear deterrence can be achieved … The talks are still in the very early stages,” the spokesperson told reporters.“This is not about replacing the US protective shield, but rather supplementing and strengthening it … The United States plays a central role in Nato’s nuclear deterrence. That is the case now, and we want it to remain so in the future,” he added.European leaders are increasingly looking to carve an independent path after a year of unprecedented upheaval in transatlantic ties, while also striving to maintain their alliance with Washington, which is still so important for the operation of the continent’s current defence systems as well as intelligence and security apparatus.While Germany is banned from developing a nuclear weapon under international agreements, France is the EU’s only nuclear power, after the UK’s departure from the bloc, and has the world’s fourth-largest stockpile.Emmanuel Macron (L), Friedrich Merz (C) and the UK’s prime minister Keir Starmer (R) during their trilateral meeting at the Munich Security Conference on 13 February 2026. Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesFor an analysis of what Marco Rubio’s speech at the Munich Security Conference really meant, you can read this insightful opinion piece by Nathalie Tocci, a Guardian Europe columnist:To read more about the political mood in Hungary and the campaigning tactics ahead of the country’s consequential parliamentary elections in April, you can read this informative opinion piece by András Bíró-Nagy, a senior research fellow at the ELTE Centre for Social Sciences in Budapest and author of ‘The Path of Hungary’s EU Membership’.Here is an extract from the piece, which examines the campaign promises of both Viktor Orbán and Péter Magyar, the opposition challenger leading the polls and riding a sense of momentum ahead of the vote: Everything Orbán presents as dangerous – European military support for Ukraine, migrants, expanding LGBTQ+ rights – is lumped together as the “Brussels path”. By contrast, peace, a migration-free country and the rejection of “gender ideology” are framed as the uniquely “Hungarian path”. The choice, voters are told, is civilisational, a message that echoes the Trump administration’s warning about European liberal democracy.</code></pre>

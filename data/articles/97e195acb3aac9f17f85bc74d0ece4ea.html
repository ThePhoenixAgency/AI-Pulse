          <p>Like how a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/slang/canon-event?ref=itsfoss.com">canon event</a> must happen, we now have a new Linux release that brings better hardware support, improved peripheral handling, and some news on how development would continue in case the main <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/?ref=itsfoss.com">torvalds/linux.git</a> repository was to go away.</p><p>Needless to say, even if some key people weren't around anymore, or were preoccupied with more urgent matters, the development of Linux wouldn't come to a standstill.</p><p>Anyhow, no new Linux release goes without Linus Torvalds <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wh0Fj7yE7iuW8awFCFt53s9T186qNbZX673E+oNCeQSFg@mail.gmail.com/?ref=itsfoss.com">having something to add</a>:</p><blockquote>No big surprises anywhere last week, so 6.19 is out as expected - just as the US prepares to come to a complete standstill later today watching the latest batch of televised commercials.<p>The betting man would expect them all to be AI-generated, but maybe some enterprising company decides to buck the trend? Doubtful, but there's always a slight chance.</p></blockquote><div><p>This coverage is based on the detailed reporting from <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-619-features-changes?ref=itsfoss.com" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>.</p></div><h2>Linux Kernel 6.19: What's New?</h2><p>This release ushers in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=102606402f4f5943266160e263c450fdfe4dd981&amp;ref=itsfoss.com">a formal continuity document</a> for the kernel project. Basically, it's a plan for what happens if Linus Torvalds' Git repository becomes unavailable for whatever reason.</p><p>Linux kernel engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/djbw/?ref=itsfoss.com">Dan Williams</a> put this together after discussions at the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/features-add-ons/maintainer-summit/?ref=itsfoss.com">2025 Maintainer Summit</a> and says the idea is quite straightforward. If the person (<em>usually Linus)</em> or people handling the mainline repository can't continue, the project needs a way to move forward quickly.</p><p>Unlike last time, <strong>Linux 6.19 is not an LTS release</strong>. <a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/linux-kernel-6-18/">Linux kernel 6.18</a> remains the 2025 <a href="https://itsfoss.com/long-term-support-lts/">long-term support release</a> with maintenance upgrades until December 2027.</p><h2>Intel Changes</h2><p>Intel's <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html?ref=itsfoss.com">Trust Domain Extensions</a> code received a major rework for KVM. These changes address issues that were causing the confidential computing feature to behave unpredictably in <a href="https://itsfoss.com/why-linux-virtual-machine/">virtual machines</a>.</p><p>Then there's the <strong>audio support for Intel's upcoming Nova Lake processors</strong>. The kernel's sound drivers can now handle <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/111047-intel-confirms-nova-lake-core-ultra-400-cpus.html?ref=itsfoss.com">Nova Lake</a> and Nova Lake S processors without needing much additional config work.</p><p>Linear Address Space Separation finally lands with this release. <a href="https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/design/products-and-solutions/processors-and-chipsets/core-ultra-200h-and-200u-series-processors-datasheet-volume-1-of-2/linear-address-space-separation-lass/?ref=itsfoss.com">Intel LASS</a> is meant to tackle specific classes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack?ref=itsfoss.com">side-channel attacks</a> that exploit processor vulnerabilities.</p><p>Similarly, Intel Xeon 6 processors get better <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access?ref=itsfoss.com">NUMA</a> handling. Granite Rapids and Clearwater Forest chips now have proper distance calculations when running in <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/fourth-generation-xeon-scalable-family-overview.html?ref=itsfoss.com#:~:text=from%20the%20nearest.-,Sub%2DNUMA%20Clustering,-Figure%202%20%E2%80%93%20Block">Sub-NUMA Clustering 3</a> configuration.</p><h2>AMD Refinements</h2><p>Virtual machines powered by AMD chips can now handle up to 4096 virtual CPUs with extended x2AVIC support. The previous limit was 512 vCPUs, so this is <strong>a substantial jump for enterprise-grade virtualization workloads</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@pravallikayakkala123/understanding-aes-encryption-and-aes-gcm-mode-an-in-depth-exploration-using-java-e03be85a3faa?ref=itsfoss.com#:~:text=encryption%20and%20decryption.-,AES/GCM%20Mode,-AES%20can%20be">AES-GCM encryption</a> gets major speed improvements on AMD Zen 3 processors. The optimizations deliver <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.19-AES-GCM-AVX2-Faster?ref=itsfoss.com">up to 74% faster performance</a> in some cases, with AVX-512 systems also benefiting from the work.</p><p>Then there's the <strong>Smart Data Cache Injection support </strong>(SDCI), where AMD EPYC 9005 Turin and newer chips <strong>can now inject data from I/O devices directly into L3 cache</strong>, skipping system memory entirely.</p><p>And, for users of older Radeon graphics cards (<em>Radeon HD 7000 to RX 300 series</em>), the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/amdgpu/index.html?ref=itsfoss.com">AMDGPU driver</a> is the default for you. This should result in better performance and Vulkan support through RADV, replacing the legacy Radeon driver.</p><h2>Storage Buffs</h2><p>EXT4 gets optimized online defragmentation by using folios instead of buffer heads. The file system now supports block sizes larger than the kernel page size, bringing some welcome performance improvements.</p><p>NTFS3 can now handle timestamps from before the year 1970. The driver <strong>switched to signed 64-bit timestamps</strong> after the issue showed up during file system testing, fixing pre-epoch date handling (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31708622/how-to-represent-dates-before-epoch-as-a-unix-timestamp?ref=itsfoss.com"><em>an example</em></a>).</p><p>F2FS brings performance optimizations across multiple areas, including sysfs, debugfs, and garbage collection. The release also fixes many bugs caught by xfstests and issues related to 16KB page support.</p><h2>Better Handheld, Laptop, and Peripheral Support</h2><p>ASUS gaming handheld users will be glad to know (<em>or not?</em>) that <strong>the Armoury driver is now supported</strong>, bringing proper hardware control for ROG Ally gaming handhelds and other ASUS <a href="https://rog.asus.com/?ref=itsfoss.com">gaming hardware</a> under Linux.</p><p>I said "<em>not"</em> earlier because the Windows implementation, <a href="https://rog.asus.com/content/armoury-crate/?ref=itsfoss.com">Armoury Crate</a>, has been a nightmare for many. It is known to trigger antivirus false positives, suffers from security vulnerabilities that can grant system-level access, and refuses to go away even after an uninstall (<em>basically bloatware</em>).</p><p>Moving on, there's now <strong>rapid charge support for Lenovo IdeaPad laptops</strong>, with the driver handling faster USB-C charging.</p><p>Several <a href="https://www.logitech.com/?ref=itsfoss.com">Logitech</a> devices get improved support too. The G Pro X Superlight 2 wireless gaming mouse works properly now, along with a new Lightspeed receiver version being included. The G13 gaming keypad also gains mainline support.</p><h3>Miscellaneous Changes</h3><p>We end this coverage with an overview of some other notable changes:</p><ul><li>Removal of the "<em>gen*cide</em>" <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.19-Drops-Genocide?ref=itsfoss.com">function</a>.</li><li>Inclusion of the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Arm-MPAM-LInux-6.19?ref=itsfoss.com">Arm MPAM driver</a>.</li><li>Early GPU support for the Snapdragon X2 Elite.</li><li>Parallel CPU hotplugging support for RISC-V chips.</li><li>Initial enablement work for 32-bit Loongson CPUs (<em>LoongArch3</em>2).</li><li>The <a href="https://tenstorrent.com/en/hardware/blackhole?ref=itsfoss.com">Tenstorrent Blackhole</a> and <a href="https://www.blacksesame.com/en?ref=itsfoss.com">Black Sesame</a> series of SoCs are now supported.</li></ul><h2>Installing Linux Kernel 6.19</h2><p>For people running <a href="https://itsfoss.com/rolling-release/">rolling distros</a> like Arch Linux or distros like Fedora and <a href="https://itsfoss.com/best-fedora-linux-distributions/">its derivatives</a>, Linux 6.19 will be available very soon. Those on other distros like Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, MX Linux, etc., could wait for it, but I wouldn't hold my breath on it.</p><p>There is, however, <strong>a way to get it early</strong><em> </em>(<em>linked below</em>) on such computers, but that involves some manual labor and a knack for risk-taking (<em>if you nuke your system, we are not to blame </em>☠️).</p><p><strong>Suggested Read 📖:</strong> <a href="https://itsfoss.com/upgrade-linux-kernel-ubuntu/"><em>Go Down the Rabbit Hole of Installing Mainline Linux Kernel</em></a></p><figure><a href="https://itsfoss.com/upgrade-linux-kernel-ubuntu/"><div><p>Install the Latest Mainline Linux Kernel Version in Ubuntu</p><p>This article shows you how to upgrade to the latest Linux kernel in Ubuntu.

						<p>Stone Story Ascension was recently revealed as the full standalone follow-up to the impressive Stone Story RPG.</p>
<p>What makes it interesting is not just the animated ASCII artwork, but you <em>don't</em> have direct control over the character. It pulls in elements from different genres like idle games, but there's various ways you do have to interact with it like planning resources, equipment and where to explore as you follow the story and watch the game open up as you adventure. There's also an interesting in-game scripting system to do some really crazy things.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/603390/Stone_Story_RPG/" target="_blank">first game</a> is quite highly rated and has a demo you can check out which is well worth a go. See the trailer for the new game below:</p>

<p>Just like the first game it will have full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Some Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Guide your Stonehead avatar through the winding streets of Acropolis.</li>
<li>Encounter an oddball cast of characters, some friendly, others… not so much.</li>
<li>See lush ASCII text designs and animations (this isn't your grandpa's PC!).</li>
<li>Immerse in a deeply atmospheric chiptune soundtrack by Moonsailor.</li>
<li>Overcome enemies in deceptively simple combat.</li>
<li>Discover new weapon recipes and combinations.</li>
<li>Take down titanic bosses and other big nasties, masters of their domain.</li>
<li>Craft your ASCII armory through an addictively simple crafting system.</li>
<li>Grow your gear’s power to take on higher difficulty encounters.</li>
<li>Customize your Stonehead with Gemstones and Talents to give you an edge in combat.</li>
<li>Elevate your Stonehead's performance with the in-game scripting language.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rexgames/stone-story-ascension-a-deceptively-simple-idle-rpg/description" target="_blank">back it on Kickstarter</a>. It has already reached the initial $10,000 goal with 24 days left.</p>

    <pre><code>Apple's 50th birthday is coming up on April 1, and to celebrate, the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, is holding in-person exhibits and promoting online content about the company's history.
Apple rarely, if ever, looks back on its history — a mentality left behind by Steve Jobs. However, it is difficult to ignore a big number like 50, so even Apple CEO Tim Cook is considering how Apple will celebrate the anniversary.
An event with leaders in the tech space will be held on March 11 alongside an exhibit of Apple products, including the Apple I, Apple IIc, Lisa, Macintosh, Newton, iPod, and iPhone. Those interested will need to buy tickets or register their interest ahead of time.
There's also the official Apple@50 TechFest on March 28, which is an all-day event with special activities included with the price of museum admission.
The Computer History Museum has a massive wealth of information surrounding the early years at Apple. It is rare to see so much available on the web, let alone for public viewing.
Apple tends to be rather defensive of its history and videos, but being a museum has its privileges. One notable online collection is a series of interviews with various people from Apple history, including Mike Markkula, John Sculley, Joanna Hoffman, and most recently, Paul Terrell (owner of Byte Shop, the first Apple I retailer).
If you're interested in something a little more hands-on, the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California is holding multiple exhibits and events surrounding Apple's 50th anniversary. It is also promoting a treasure trove of photos, documents, videos, and interviews available on its website.
For those looking for something a little more physical and available in your home, the book, "Apple: The First 50 Years," by David Pogue, is due to release on March 10, 2026. Expect more celebrations, products, and reporting around Apple and its history during this significant milestone over the next few months.</code></pre>

                    <p>Dana Eden, a producer working on the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-tv">Apple TV</a> espionage drama "Tehran," has been found dead while filming for the show in Greece. 
</p><p>Filming of the fourth season of spy thriller <em>Tehran</em> was underway when Eden was discovered in an Athens hotel on Sunday. Discovered by her brother, Eden's death is being treated as a suicide initially, with an investigation underway to determine what happened to her. 
</p><p>Israeli public broadcaster Kan, which produces the show along with Apple TV, called Eden a senior figure in Israel's television industry, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/dana-eden-tehran-produer-dead-52-apple-tv-1236725820/">reports</a> <em>Deadline</em>. She played a central role in creating some of Kan's major productions in her career. 
</p><p>"Her professional and personal legacy will continue to shape Israeli television for many years to come," the obit says. 
</p><p>She served as the executive producer of <em>Tehran</em>, but has worked on many different shows over her career. This recently included producing roles for <em>Girl, Woman</em> and <em>The Prosecution</em>, with 34 IMDB credits as a producer, six as a writer, and one as an actress. 
</p><p>Eden passed away at the age of 52. 
</p><p>It is expected that this will cause some interruption to the fourth season, but it is unclear how much impact Eden's death will have on the production overall. 
</p><h2>Unknown causes</h2><p>While there is no official cause of death for the producer, an investigation will be carried out. An autopsy has been requested, with police collecting security camera footage and testimonies. 
</p><p>The connection to a show about an Israeli Mossad agent in Iran has led to some speculation online about interference by Iranian agents. Donna and Shula Productions, the production company making the show, insists that rumors about foul play are completely baseless and untrue. 
</p><p>Since Israeli citizens are banned from traveling to Iran, and due to cultural sensitivities, <em>Tehran</em> is filmed in Greece instead. 
</p><p>Season three of <em>Tehran</em> is <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/12/04/espionage-thriller-tehran-sneaks-back-onto-apple-tv-in-january">currently airing</a> on Apple TV. </p>

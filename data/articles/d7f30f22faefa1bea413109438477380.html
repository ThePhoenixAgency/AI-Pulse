    <div><div> <p>French&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;blockaded sites in <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/paris/" target="_self">Paris</a> on Thursday in protest against a <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260104-france-tightens-food-import-checks-as-farmers-protest-mercosur-deal" target="_self">sweeping trade deal</a> the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/european-union/" target="_self">European Union</a> is poised to sign with South American nations and other local grievances.</p> <p>The farmers overran police checkpoints to enter the city, driving along the Champs-Élysées avenue and blocking the road around the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/arc-de-triomphe/" target="_self">Arc de Triomphe</a> monument before dawn, before gathering in front of the National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament.</p> <p>National Assembly President Yael Braun-Pivet was booed and jostled when she stepped outside of the assembly's gates to talk with protesters.</p> <p>The rightwing Coordination Rurale union had called for protests in the capital amid anger against a free trade agreement between the European Union and South American bloc&nbsp;<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/mercosur/" target="_self">Mercosur</a>,&nbsp;which they fear may flood the country with cheap food imports,&nbsp;and the way the government is handling a cattle disease.</p> <p>"We are between resentment and despair. We have a feeling of abandonment, like with Mercosur. We have been abandoned in favour of a space shuttle, an Airbus, or a car," Stéphane Pelletier, the deputy president of the union in Vienne, in central France, told Reuters.</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/750fe1e4-ec5d-11f0-8f92-005056bfb2b6/w:980/000-89YN3M2.jpg" alt="French farmers rolled into Paris on tractors Thursday morning in a show of dissent against a free trade deal they fear will create unfair competition."> <figcaption> <span>French farmers rolled into Paris on tractors Thursday morning in a show of dissent against a free trade deal they fear will create unfair competition.</span> <span> Thomas Samson, AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>The action drew a swift from rebuke from the government, which warned it would "not stand by" and allow "illegal" actions.</p> <p>Blocking a motorway or "attempting to gather in front of the National Assembly with all the symbolism that this entails is once again illegal", government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon told France Info Radio.</p> <p>The protest comes days after the European Commission proposed making 45 billion euros of EU funding available earlier to&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;and&nbsp;agreed to cut import duties&nbsp;on some fertilizers in a bid to win over countries wavering in their support of Mercosur.</p> <h2>Italy poised to back deal</h2> <p>The EU-Mercosur deal would create the world's biggest free-trade area and help the 27-nation bloc to export more vehicles, machinery, wines and spirits to Latin America.</p> <p>But farmers fear being undercut by a flow of cheaper goods from agricultural giant Brazil and its neighbours.</p> <p>The deal is backed by countries such as Germany and Spain and the Commission appeared to have <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260107-eu-poised-to-secure-italy-backing-contentious-mercosur-deal" target="_self">won Italy's backing</a>, meaning it would have the votes needed to approve the trade accord with or without French support. A vote on the deal is expected on Friday.</p> <p>Even though Paris has won significant last-minute concessions, the trade deal is a political hot potato for the government, with municipal elections in March and the far right polling strongly ahead of elections to replace Macron in 2027.</p> <p>"This treaty is still not acceptable," Bregeon, the government spokesperson,&nbsp;told France Info radio.</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260107-eu-poised-to-secure-italy-backing-contentious-mercosur-deal" target="_self">EU poised to secure Italy's backing for contentious Mercosur deal</a></p> <p>Farmers&nbsp;are also demanding an end to cow culling prompted by a series of&nbsp;highly contagious lumpy skin disease, which they consider excessive and advocate for vaccination instead.</p> <p>In another protest near the southwestern city of Bordeaux, about 40 farm vehicles blocked access to a fuel depot, according to the local authorities.</p> <p>During earlier protests, farmer blocked roads, sprayed manure and dumped garbage in front of government offices to force the authorities to review their policy.</p> <p>Belgian farmers have also staged mass protests against the trade deal, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251218-farmers-to-protest-the-eu-mercosur-treaty-in-brussels-as-european-leaders-meet-in-summit" target="_self">rolling some 1,000 tractors into Brussels</a> in December.</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with Reuters)</em></p> </div></div>

<hr />

<p>Palantir Technologies just posted $1.41 billion in quarterly revenue. That is 70% higher than the same quarter last year. The stock is up 1,700% in three years. And the company has fewer employees than a mid-sized law firm.</p>

<p>We pulled financial data on every major defense technology and enterprise software company in our database. Then we asked a simple question: has any other defense-adjacent company doubled its revenue this fast?</p>

<p>The answer is almost nobody.</p>

<p>The Numbers That Broke the Pattern</p>

<p>Palantir reported full-year 2025 revenue of $4.48 billion. In 2023, that number was $2.23 billion. That is a clean double in two years — a 101% increase.</p>

<p>For context, here is how the major defense and defense-adjacent tech companies performed over the same period:</p>

<p>Company<br />
2023 Revenue<br />
2025 Revenue<br />
2-Year Growth<br />
Employees</p>

<p>Palantir<br />
$2.23B<br />
$4.48B<br />
+101%<br />
2,920</p>

<p>Lockheed Martin<br />
$67.6B<br />
$71.0B<br />

110,000</p>

<p>Boeing<br />
$77.8B<br />
$66.5B<br />

171,000</p>

<p>RTX (Raytheon)<br />
$68.9B<br />
$73.2B<br />
+6%<br />
180,000</p>

<p>Booz Allen Hamilton<br />
$9.3B<br />
$11.4B<br />
+23%<br />
35,600</p>

<p>CrowdStrike<br />
$3.1B<br />
$4.3B<br />
+39%<br />
8,600</p>

<p>Lockheed Martin grew 5%. Boeing shrank. CrowdStrike — one of the fastest-growing cybersecurity firms in the world — managed 39%. Palantir doubled.</p>

<p>The only company in our dataset that comes close is Nvidia, which tripled revenue over the same period. But Nvidia sells chips. Palantir sells software to governments. These are not the same business.</p>

<p>Revenue Per Employee: The Real Story</p>

<p>Palantir generates $1.53 million in revenue per employee. That is not a defense company number. That is a software monopoly number.</p>

<p>Here is how it compares:</p>

<p>Company<br />
Revenue<br />
Employees<br />
Rev/Employee</p>

<p>Palantir<br />
$4.48B<br />
2,920<br />
$1.53M</p>

<p>Nvidia<br />
$130.5B<br />
13,775<br />
$9.47M</p>

<p>CrowdStrike<br />
$4.3B<br />
8,600<br />
$500K</p>

<p>Lockheed Martin<br />
$71.0B<br />
110,000<br />
$645K</p>

<p>Boeing<br />
$66.5B<br />
171,000<br />
$389K</p>

<p>Salesforce<br />
$38.0B<br />
72,000<br />
$528K</p>

<p>Booz Allen<br />
$11.4B<br />
35,600<br />
$320K</p>

<p>Booz Allen Hamilton makes $320K per employee. That is the consulting model — you sell hours, you need bodies. Lockheed makes $645K per employee. That is the hardware model — you sell jets, you need factories and engineers.</p>

<p>Palantir makes $1.53M per employee. That is the platform model. You build the software once. You deploy it everywhere. The Pentagon, the Army, ICE, the NHS. Same codebase, different contracts.</p>

<p>The Government Dependency Question</p>

<p>Critics have called Palantir a government contractor dressed as a tech company. The numbers tell a more complicated story.</p>

On January 29, Bernstein analyst David Dai increased the price target on ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) from $1,642 to $1,911 and kept an Outperform rating.</p>   <p>This update comes after the company reported its 2025 fourth-quarter and full-year results. ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) reported very strong fourth-quarter net bookings of EUR 13.2 billion, which were far above market expectations.</p>   <figure><div> <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/USamTPhrMQNHNMJtO1qN5g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUzOA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/b36da0caf4f59d829430a8a0f203a758" alt="Bernstein and RBC Capital Raise ASML Price Targets" /></p></div> <figcaption>Bernstein and RBC Capital Raise ASML Price Targets  </figcaption> </figure>   <p>On January 29, RBC Capital also maintained its Outperform rating and raised its price target on ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) from $1,550 to $1,625 on the stock. This increase in price target came after the company reported record quarterly bookings of EUR 13.2 billion, which exceeded estimates of EUR 8 billion to EUR 10 billion.</p>      <p>RBC Capital pointed out that strong demand driven by AI is supporting orders for DRAM and Advanced Logic, which is more than offsetting slower business in the Chinese market. The research firm expects revenue to continue growing at a double-digit pace into fiscal year 2027. This growth will be supported by tight DRAM supply, adoption of more advanced nodes in AI processors, and renewed competition among foundries.</p>   <p>ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a Dutch company that designs and develops advanced semiconductor equipment systems, including photolithography machines, which are used to produce chips.</p>   <p>While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

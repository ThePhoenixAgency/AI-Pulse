  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>California is being blanketed by a winter storm that has brought the coldest air mass in three years to the state – along with heavy snowfall, road closures and power outages.</p><p>Two Pacific storms are expected to bring more than three feet of snow to the Sierra Nevadas and heavy rainfall to lower elevation parts of the state, including Los Angeles and San Diego, where flooding could occur in recent burn scars.</p><p>The National Weather Service <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd">predicts</a> “multi-day, very heavy snow totals of more than a foot” through the southern Cascades down to southern California and east into the Rockies. The heaviest snowfall is predicted in the Sierras.</p><p>Heavy snowfall of up to 3 to 5ft was predicted for locations above 6,000ft elevation, with snowfall up to 7ft expected at higher elevations, according to the National Weather Service Hanford office’s <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=HNX&amp;wwa=winter%20storm%20warning">winter storm warning</a> for regions near Yosemite national park. The warning was in effect until 10pm local time on Thursday.</p><p>The University of California Berkeley’s Central Sierra Snow Lab, near Donner Pass, <a href="https://cssl.berkeley.edu/">reported</a> 28in of snow on Tuesday, with another three feet expected in the next two days. I-80 is <a href="https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=80">closed</a> from Colfax to the Nevada state line due to snow.</p><p>Multiple backcountry skiers were missing on Tuesday afternoon after an avalanche, <a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/northern-california-storm-coverage-updates-february-17-2026/70392159?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Email%20-%20Local%20Breaking%20News&amp;utm_source=6994d07d4ecc5586021861664041fa7b&amp;brzu=fbcbebd70b232842e93f4689c998d314f0797356c0caa05938bd6cf7abe0d18a&amp;lctg=62da43effc13144f6948e305">local news</a> reported, citing the Nevada county sheriff’s office. The group was in the Castle Peak area, where an avalanche was reported around 11.30am.</p><p>The Sierra Avalanche Center <a href="https://www.sierraavalanchecenter.org/">issued an avalanche warning</a> for the Central Sierra Nevadas through 4am on Wednesday. In a statement it said: “A widespread natural <a href="https://avalanche.org/avalanche-encyclopedia/avalanche/">avalanche</a> cycle is expected over the next 24 hours.”</p><p>As a result of the weather, some Lake Tahoe area ski resorts had already announced closures, while others warned skiers to check road conditions before heading up the mountain. All lifts at Palisades and Alpine <a href="https://blog.palisadestahoe.com/operations/feb-16-operations-update/">closed</a> at about 12pm Tuesday “due to conditions, visibility, and wind”.</p><p>Yosemite national park remains open, with tire chain requirements and road closure warnings, although visitors hoping to see February’s Firefall at Horsetail Fall may be disappointed. The fleeting moment when the waterfall blazes golden in the rays of the setting sun will likely be obscured by weather conditions.</p><p>“Horsetail Fall is very unlikely to be illuminated at sunset due to the cloudy conditions for the next several days and possibly through the weekend,” the park said in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/YosemiteNPS/photos/most-of-yosemite-including-yosemite-valley-is-receiving-snow-with-stormy-weather/1434492571376972/">a social media post</a>. “Due to weather, the pedestrian route on the road to the viewing area has been taken down.”</p><p>Storm conditions were affecting the rest of the state, even where snow is not expected.</p><p>Stanford University closed for about two hours on Tuesday morning, following a power outage. In <a href="https://emergency.stanford.edu/">a statement</a>, the university said “One of the main PG&amp;E transmission lines feeding the campus is reportedly impacted, causing the outage.” According to the university’s website, the outage began around 9.16am local time, and campus had reopened by 11.39am.</p><p>Further south, sections of Highway 1 <a href="https://roads.dot.ca.gov/?roadnumber=1">remained closed</a> on Tuesday after Caltrans shut down a 45-mile stretch of the coastal highway Monday following a landslide. The road is still closed in two sections: from 2.3 miles north of Lucia to 16.3 miles south of Big Sur, and from 1.8 miles north of the junction of Route 135 and Soloman Road to 7.4 miles south of Guadalupe at Black Road.</p><p>Caltrans had reopened a section of the highway just weeks earlier, after three years of repairs caused by a landslide due to heavy rains.</p><p>In southern California, the National Weather Service Los Angeles/Oxnard office said heavy snow was “possible” along the I-5 and I-14 corridors, with wind gusts “up to 60 to 70 mph possible”.</p><p>Flood watches were in effect in Los Angeles, where the county had issued <a href="https://lacounty.gov/emergency/">an evacuation warning</a> in regions impacted by the Palisades, Eaton and other fires because of potential flooding in the burn scars.</p><p>“Areas near the Canyon, Bethany, Eaton, Palisades, Kenneth, Sunset, Lidia, Hurst, Franklin, and Bridge fires should prepare to evacuate in the event an Evacuation Order is issued,” the <a href="https://pw.lacounty.gov/wrd/forecast/index.cfm">county website</a> read.</p><p>Floodwaters on Monday had already engulfed parts of Los Angeles, causing havoc for even the non-human, as the local NBC outlet noted that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu0VTcDSkqU">a local food delivery robot</a> had gotten stuck in flooding in West Hollywood.</p></div></div>

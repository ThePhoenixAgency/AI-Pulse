<div> <div><p>The GHD Speed hair dryer offers precise control over both airflow and temperature, and the maximum settings are ultra-powerful and nice and hot. It's well-designed, making it easy to see which settings you're using at a glance, with thoughtful additions such as mode lock and a constant cool setting helping to elevate the model above the competition. However, I'm on the fence regarding the usefulness of the cool "halo" airflow design – and, overall, the GHD Speed is on the bulkier, heavier side for such a premium offering.</p> </div>

<h2><span>GHD Speed: two-minute review</span></h2><p>The GHD Speed is one of the most user-friendly hair dryers on the market. It offers a wide selection of temperatures and windspeed options, with the maximum mode delivering a hurricane of power that will blast your hair dry in ultra-quick time.</p><p>Other welcome additions include a mode lock, which allows you to wield the hair dryer confidently without worrying about accidentally pressing any buttons, and an always-on cool mode alongside the cool shot pulse option.</p><p>None of those are the USP, though. It's the "halo dual-airflow technology" that GHD is highlighting here, which the brands states will dry hair without heat damage, thanks to the "halo" of cool air that surrounds the heated airflow. GHD says this allows you to get closer to the scalp without fear of burning it, plus you can hold the dryer by the barrel if you want to, because it will never become hot. I'm not convinced the former is true, and the latter is possible but feels a little unnatural.</p><p>However, the main potential sticking point is really the lofty price tag. While it could be seen as being partially justified by the impressive power and generous array of control options, competitors such as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dyson">Dyson</a> offer much more in a very similar price bracket – particularly when it comes to attachments (the GHD Speed includes a concentrator in the box, while the diffuser is an optional add-on).</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iMvecJQGxVTuQtV8BnDuJc.jpg" alt="GHD Speed hair dryer">

It's significantly cheaper than Dyson's Supersonic Nural, which comes in at £399.99, but that model has the benefit of a number of flashy features such as automatic temperature adjustment and attachment memory – plus a much wider selection of attachments included as standard.</p><p>That's not to say the GHD Speed doesn't feel like a premium option. There's a wide selection of controls, the build quality is high, and it's ultra-powerful too.</p><ul><li><strong>Value for money score: 3.5 out of 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>GHD Speed specs</span></h2><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th colspan="1"><p>Model:</p></th><th colspan="1"><p>GHD Speed</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Wattage:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>1,800-2,100W</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Weight (without cord, appox):</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>1.4lbs / 620g</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Size (H x W x L, approx):</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>2.6 x 7.9 x 9.3in / 6.7 x 20 x 23.5cm</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Airflow settings:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Temperature settings:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Extra modes:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Cool shot, continuous cool</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Cord length:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>9.2ft / 2.8m</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h2><span>GHD Speed review: design</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Slightly bulky design</strong></li><li><strong>Lots of setting options, plus a mode lock, all intuitively designed</strong></li><li><strong>Delivers a "halo" of cool air at all times</strong></li></ul><p>The GHD Speed has a slightly strange, disjointed design that looks like the model should be foldable – but it isn't. It's both chunky and heavy, weighing in at roughly 620g without its cord (by contrast, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/home/hair-care/dyson-supersonic-nural-review-tech-packed-and-time-saving">Dyson Supersonic Nural</a> is around 455g).</p><p>Where this dryer shines is in its control options and design. On the rear of the handle you'll find an on-off slider switch, alongside the temperature and windspeed controls. There are four windspeed options, and four heat settings – in each case, one or two more settings than is usual.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HS9kerxBGVkg7wM2KD49vb.jpg" alt="GHD Speed hair dryer">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also a cool shot option, which you can activate using the heat button or via a separate button on the rear of the handle. You'd opt for the button on the rear if you wanted an extended period of cold air, whereas the button on the front will only deliver cool air for the length of time for which it's depressed.</p><p>Also on the front of the handle is a slider to lock the current settings, so that you don't accidentally change them as you handle the dryer. In my opinion, I'd appreciate such functionality on more hair dryers – it seems to be a struggle for manufacturers to position the buttons so that they're easy to access yet avoid accidental presses. GHD's solution is both neat and effective.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJdEJB8FhksxRkG7mqR5fb.jpg" alt="GHD Speed hair dryer">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When switched on, lights around the side of the dryer barrel illuminate to indicate the windspeed and heat settings (these switch from orange to blue when you're in a cool mode). It's understandable at a glance, with no confusion over which mode you're in.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E9wa7CDhcRdSdeeYLMXUob.jpg" alt="GHD Speed hair dryer">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Design score: 4 out of 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>GHD Speed review: performance</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Very hot and very powerful on max settings</strong></li><li><strong>Relatively easy to wield and mode lock switch is useful</strong></li><li><strong>Dual airflow isn't very noticeable, but my hair was left looking smooth</strong></li></ul><p>The GHD Speed's USP is the "halo dual-airflow technology", which essentially means that there's an always-cool ring of air encircling the main airflow. GHD states that this will enable you to get closer to your scalp – but in use I couldn't really feel the cool "halo", and nor could I position the barrel near my head without it becoming uncomfortably toasty. This was true even when angling the dryer side-on.</p><p>The halo feature is also meant to ensure the main barrel of the dryer remains cool throughout use, allowing you to hold the GHD Speed from there. While this is correct, the reality is that I didn't find this a natural position to grip the hair dryer – maybe in time this will change.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZZtHmHDHfHs5QroNgwwEc.jpg" alt="GHD Speed hair dryer">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Slightly confusing special feature aside, I was super-impressed with this dryer. In max modes the GHD Speed is both ultra-powerful and super-hot. In fact, it's the only dryer I've used where I haven't automatically bumped it right up to maximum settings every time. I welcomed the added control afforded by the extra settings options, as well as the mode lock for preventing accidental presses.</p><p>GHD claims the dryer "smooths and seals the cuticle" for a glossy look. I tried a half-and-half test with another hair dryer (the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/home/hair-care/dyson-supersonic-r-hair-dryer-review">Dyson Supersonic r</a>) and while the GHD's side was perhaps a touch smoother, I wouldn't say it had the 56% more shine promised by GHD.</p><ul><li><strong>Performance score: 4.5 out of 5</strong></li></ul><h3><span>How I tested the GHD Speed</span></h3><p>I used the GHD Speed as my regular hair dryer for a couple of weeks, to get a general feel for its performance and how it left my hair looking. I also timed how long it took me to dry my collarbone-length hair, and compared the results to other hair dryers I've reviewed. I also assessed how easy and comfortable it is to hold, and how easy it is to use in general, again comparing my findings to other hair dryers on the market.</p><ul><li>First reviewed February 2025</li></ul>

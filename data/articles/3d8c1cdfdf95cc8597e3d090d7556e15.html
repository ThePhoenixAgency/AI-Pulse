  <h1>iPads, MacBook Air, and Apple TV — everything Apple has ever launched in March</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <pre><code>Historically, Apple's March has been oddly busy in recent years, but as the company teases its newest "special Apple experience" happening on March 4, 2026, here's a look back at what we've seen before, and what we might see this time.
That March 4, 2026 event is invitation-only one in New York, London, and Shanghai, and won't be streamed. It's being called an Apple Experience, too, which is the term the company used for the January 2026 event around the Apple Creator Studio .
If this a product announcement, though, then there is a precedent for it. And while there weren't even any Apple March events at all until 2008, since then they have been wide-ranging.
The first March eventOn March 6, 2008, Steve Jobs took to the stage to unveil the iPhone Software Roundup. It was about features new to the iPhone, such as push email, but it really launched the App Store.
That App Store idea seems to have gone well. Yet it took Apple another three years before it tried a March event again. Compared to many Apple events, this time there was no secrecy Apple made it clear from the start that its March 2, 2011 event would launch the iPad 2. There was a surprise, though, as Steve Jobs hosted the event despite being on medical leave.
Less surprising was that one year later on March 7, 2012, it was the turn of the iPad 3.
There was nothing in March 2013, but in 2014 — there wasn't very much either. Instead of an event, Apple put out a press release unveiling an iPhone 5C that had been upgraded to 8GB.
Apple gets serious about MarchAfter that, there was an event in March 2015 and then either an event or a press release launch every March for five years. March 9, 2015 kicked it off with an Apple Special Event called "Spring Forward."
Apple used this event to launch a 12-inch MacBook Air with high-resolution display. But if you remember this event at all, it was for the first announcement of the Apple Watch.
That was released the next month, and the model continues to get updates to this day.
It also got updates the next year when Apple held a "Let us loop you in" event on March 21, 2016. Alongside those Apple Watch updates, this event included the first 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and the original version of the iPhone SE.
There was a 2016 update to that first iPhone SE, too, which had its entry-level storage doubled to 32GB. But that announcement came in a press release, as did the debut of a regular 9.7-inch iPad with A9 processor, and Apple raised the minimum storage for the iPad mini 4 to 128GB.
This was also when Apple sent out press releases announcing the video creation app, Clips. You never used it.
Come March 27, 2018, Apple was back to hosting live events — although this time at the Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago. Apple was launching a partnership with Chicago Public Schools then, but at the event itself, it unveiled the sixth-generation iPad, now with Apple Pencil support.
But speaking of partnerships, ultimately Apple may never have arranged as many as would come from what it did on March 25, 2019. Certainly Apple, for all its prior marketing work, has never partnered with as many celebrities.
For "It's Show Time" was the announcement of Apple TV (then Apple TV+), with the likes of Oprah Winfrey.

March in the 2020sOnce more in 2020, Apple launched multiple devices in March, but didn't give any of them an event. Instead, it was press release time again, as Apple unveiled:
New MacBook Air with scissor keyboard
Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro
iPad Pro 4th generation
Mac mini with increased storageThat was the first-ever Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro, described by AppleInsider at the time as a $350 iPad accessor launched during pandemic-fueled recession. But speaking of keyboards, the best feature of the MacBook Air was its return to a scissor-key design, and away from the unpopular butterfly keyboard. It wasn't a surprise, given the COVID pandemic, that these would be launched via press release instead of an event. The following year, 2021, saw neither.
But then on March 8, 2022, there was a live event called "Peek performance." This featured two new colors for the iPhone 13 range, although the two were both green.
There was also an update for the iPhone SE, and the iPad.
But most significant of all in this event, was Apple's surprise launch of an entirely new Mac. The Mac Studio was born in a March event — and so was the Apple Studio Display.
Maybe Apple needed a rest after that, because March 2023 was empty — and then March 2024 had press releases. Specifically, on March 4, 2025, Apple announced the M3 13-inch MacBook Air and 15-inch MacBook Air models.
Which brings us to the latest March launches so far, as on March 5, 2025, Apple issued some more press releases. It announced:
iPad Air (7th generation with M3)
iPad (11th generation with A16)
MacBook Air M4
Mac Studio M4Looking for patternsApple does seem to like releasing iPads in March, although it also does so at other times of the year. The lower-cost iPhone SE popped up in a couple of March months, so perhaps rumors of the equivalent iPhone 17e coming out in March 2026 are correct.
And, there's the M5 Max and M5 Pro MacBook Pros, which have been expected soon since October 2025.
As for the idea of a live event versus a press release, this time Apple may be going somewhere in the middle. Assuming that it does launch updated devices, it's launching them to an invited audience only.
Perhaps as some number of people in New York, London, and Shanghai get shown new iPads or the new iPhone, the rest of us will have wait a little while for the first reports.</code></pre>

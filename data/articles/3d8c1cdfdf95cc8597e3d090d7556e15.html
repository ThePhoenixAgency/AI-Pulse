  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <p>Historically, Apple's March has been oddly busy in recent years, but as the company teases its newest "special Apple experience" happening on March 4, 2026, here's a look back at what we've seen before, and what we might see this time.
</p><p>That March 4, 2026 event is <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/16/apple-is-having-an-event-on-march-4-in-new-york">invitation-only</a> one in New York, London, and Shanghai, and won't be streamed. It's being called an Apple Experience, too, which is the term the company used for the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/23/creators-invited-to-three-day-apple-creator-studio-event">January 2026</a> event around the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-creator-studio">Apple Creator Studio</a> .
</p><p>If this a product announcement, though, then there is a precedent for it. And while there weren't even any Apple March events at all until 2008, since then they have been wide-ranging.
</p><h2>The first March event</h2><p>On <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/08/03/06/apple_posts_iphone_software_roadmap_event_stream">March 6, 2008</a>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/steve-jobs">Steve Jobs</a> took to the stage to unveil the iPhone Software Roundup. It was about features new to the iPhone, such as push email, but it really launched the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/app-store">App Store</a>.
</p><p>That App Store idea seems to have gone well. Yet it took Apple another three years before it tried a March event again. </p><p>Compared to many Apple events, this time there was no secrecy Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/23/apple_sends_out_invites_for_ipad_2_media_event_on_march_2">made it clear</a> from the start that its March 2, 2011 event would launch the iPad 2. There <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/02/steve_jobs_surprises_with_return_to_the_stage_at_apples_ipad_2_event">was a surprise</a>, though, as Steve Jobs hosted the event despite being on medical leave.
</p><p>Less surprising was that one year later on March 7, 2012, it was the turn of the iPad 3.
</p><p>There was nothing in March 2013, but in 2014 — there wasn't very much either. Instead of an event, Apple put out a press release unveiling an iPhone 5C that had been <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/14/03/18/apple-releases-cheaper-8gb-iphone-5c-on-uk-carrier-o2">upgraded to 8GB</a>.
</p><h2>Apple gets serious about March</h2><p>After that, there was an event in March 2015 and then either an event or a press release launch every March for five years. March 9, 2015 kicked it off with an Apple Special Event called "<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/15/03/04/yerba-buena-center-getting-spring-forward-makeover-for-mondays-apple-watch-event">Spring Forward</a>."
</p><p>Apple used this event to launch a 12-inch <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/macbook-air">MacBook Air</a> with high-resolution display. But if you remember this event at all, it was for the first announcement of the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-watch">Apple Watch</a>.
</p><p>That was released <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/04/24/apple-watch-arrived-on-buyers-wrists-10-years-ago">the next month</a>, and the model continues to get updates to this day.
</p><p>It also got updates the next year when Apple held a "Let us loop you in" event on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/03/10/apple-plans-to-loop-you-in-at-march-21-event-with-expected-4-iphone-new-97-ipad">March 21, 2016</a>. Alongside those Apple Watch updates, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/03/24/hands-on-apple-takes-aim-at-pc-users-with-97-ipad-pro">this event</a> included the first 9.7-inch <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ipad-pro">iPad Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/16/04/08/strong-iphone-se-launch-suggests-15m-incremental-2016-sales-for-apple-rbc-says">original version</a> of the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-se">iPhone SE</a>.
</p><p>There was a 2016 update to that first iPhone SE, too, which had its entry-level storage doubled to 32GB. But that announcement came in a press release, as did the debut of a regular 9.7-inch iPad with A9 processor, and Apple raised the minimum storage for the iPad mini 4 to 128GB.
</p><p>This was also when Apple sent out press releases announcing the video creation app, Clips. You <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/10/11/apple-clips-social-video-app-killed-after-eight-years">never used it</a>.
</p><p>Come March 27, 2018, Apple was back to hosting live events — although this time at the Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago. Apple was <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/03/28/apple-to-turn-lane-tech-into-center-for-excellence-for-training-teachers-on-swift">launching a partnership</a> with Chicago Public Schools then, but at the event itself, it unveiled the sixth-generation iPad, now with <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-pencil">Apple Pencil</a> support.
</p><p>But speaking of partnerships, ultimately Apple may never have arranged as many as would come from what it did on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/11/apple-announces-march-25-its-show-time-event">March 25, 2019</a>. Certainly Apple, for all its prior marketing work, has never partnered with as many celebrities.
</p><p>For "It's Show Time" was the announcement of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-tv">Apple TV</a> (then <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-tv-plus">Apple TV+</a>), with the likes of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/09/oprah-winfrey-reveals-why-shes-bringing-her-book-club-to-apple-tv">Oprah Winfrey</a>.
</p><div><p><a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/33126-57660-000-lead-Oprah-Book-Club-(Source-Oprah-Magazine)-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/33126-57660-000-lead-Oprah-Book-Club-(Source-Oprah-Magazine)-xl.jpg" alt="Oprah Winfrey, pictured in her "></a></p><p><span>Oprah Winfrey, pictured in her "The Oprah Magazine"</span></p></div><p>There was also the launch of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-news">Apple News+</a>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> — and the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-card">Apple Card</a>.
</p><h2>March in the 2020s</h2><p>Once more in 2020, Apple launched multiple devices in March, but didn't give any of them an event. Instead, it was press release time again, as Apple unveiled:
</p><ul><li>New MacBook Air with scissor keyboard</li>
<li>Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro</li>
<li>iPad Pro 4th generation</li>
<li>Mac mini with increased storage</li></ul><p>That was the first-ever <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/magic-keyboard">Magic Keyboard</a> for iPad Pro, described by <em>AppleInsider</em> at the time as a $350 iPad accessor launched during <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/03/18/apples-launches-350-ipad-keyboard-as-world-grapples-with-recession">pandemic-fueled recession</a>. But speaking of keyboards, the best feature of the MacBook Air was its return to a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/03/21/why-the-new-features-of-the-2020-macbook-air-are-a-big-deal">scissor-key design</a>, and away from the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/05/05/initial-failures-of-apples-butterfly-keyboard-doomed-it-from-the-start">unpopular butterfly keyboard</a>. </p><p>It wasn't a surprise, given the COVID pandemic, that these would be launched via press release instead of an event. The following year, 2021, saw neither.
</p><p>But then on March 8, 2022, there was a live event called "<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/03/09/everything-apple-released-at-the-peek-performance-event---and-what-we-thought">Peek performance</a>." This featured two new colors for the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-13">iPhone 13</a> range, although the two were both green.
</p><p>There was also an update for the iPhone SE, and the iPad.
</p><p>But most significant of all in this event, was Apple's surprise launch of an entirely new Mac. The <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/mac-studio">Mac Studio</a> was born in a March event — and so was the Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/studio-display">Studio Display</a>.
</p><p>Maybe Apple needed a rest after that, because March 2023 was empty — and then March 2024 had press releases. Specifically, on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/03/12/m3-macbook-air-review-the-ideal-mac-laptop-for-intel-hold-outs">March 4, 2025</a>, Apple announced the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/m3">M3</a> 13-inch MacBook Air and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/15-inch-macbook-air">15-inch MacBook Air</a> models.
</p><p>Which brings us to the latest March launches so far, as on March 5, 2025, Apple issued some more press releases. It announced:
</p><ul><li>iPad Air (7th generation with M3)</li>
<li>iPad (11th generation with A16)</li>
<li>MacBook Air M4</li>
<li>Mac Studio M4</li></ul><h2>Looking for patterns</h2><p>Apple does seem to like releasing iPads in March, although it also does so at other times of the year. The lower-cost iPhone SE popped up in a couple of March months, so perhaps rumors of the equivalent <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-17e">iPhone 17e</a> coming out in March 2026 are correct.
</p><p>And, there's the M5 Max and M5 Pro <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/macbook-pro">MacBook Pros</a>, which have <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/04/questionable-leak-macbook-pro-with-m5-pro-and-m5-max-coming-in-march-not-february">been expected</a> soon since October 2025.
</p><p>As for the idea of a live event versus a press release, this time Apple may be going somewhere in the middle. Assuming that it does launch updated devices, it's launching them to an invited audience only.
</p><p>Perhaps as some number of people in New York, London, and Shanghai get shown new iPads or the new iPhone, the rest of us will have wait a little while for the first reports.</p> </div></div>

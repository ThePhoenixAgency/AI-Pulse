And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this."</p></div><div><p>Colbert, host of The Late Show, went on to explain that new FCC guidance on the "equal time" rule - which requires certain TV and radio broadcasters to give equal time to rival political candidates - could have created legal trouble for the network, according to CBS lawyers.</p></div><div><p>The FCC regulates radio, TV and satellite airwaves, giving it power over a range of matters, including mergers and decency complaints.</p></div><div><p>CBS flatly denied Colbert's claims in a statement on Tuesday.</p></div><div><p>"The Late Show was not prohibited by CBS from broadcasting the interview with Rep James Talarico," the network said.</p></div><div><p>It added in a statement: "The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates... and presented options for how the equal time for other candidates could be fulfilled. </p></div><div><p>The full interview was later posted on YouTube, where FCC rules do not apply.</p></div><div><p>News content has traditionally been exempted from the "equal time" rule.</p></div><div><p>But the FCC has said the rule may soon apply to late-night programmes like Colbert's. It may also apply to political radio programmes, which tend to have more conservative hosts and listeners.</p></div><div><p>After issuing the new guidance in January, Brendan Carr, the FCC chairman known for taking an expansive view of his power, said on X that "for years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late-night &amp; daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programmes - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. </p></div><div><p>"Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities." </p></div><div><p>US President Donald Trump has at times said he is considering pulling the FCC licence for several US networks that he says have aired views critical of his presidency. </p></div><div><p>Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, agreed in July to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute with Trump regarding an interview it broadcast on CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris.</p></div><div><p>Business commentators have questioned whether the deal was made partly so as to not affect Paramount's planned merger with Skydance Media, which Trump had the power to halt.</p></div><div><p>CBS News has a partnership agreement with the BBC, meaning news content including video footage can be shared. BBC News is editorially independent of CBS.</p></div><div><p>Anna Gomez, the only Democrat on the FCC board, condemned the response by CBS, saying Colbert and the network had the First Amendment constitutional right to free speech.</p></div><div><p>"This is yet another troubling example of corporate capitulation in the face of this administration's broader campaign to censor and control speech," she said in a statement, adding that the FCC had "no lawful authority to pressure broadcasters for political purposes".</p></div><div><p>She continued: "It is no secret that Paramount, CBS's parent company, has regulatory matters before the government, but corporate interests cannot justify retreating from airing newsworthy content."</p></div><div><p>She has previously accused the FCC's Republican leaders of using the equal-time rule to unfairly penalise critics in violation of the constitutional right to free speech. </p></div><div><p>The Late Show is due to end its 33-year run in May. Colbert has been the host since 2015.</p></div></article></div></div>

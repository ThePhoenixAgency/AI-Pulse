Concerns were raised after hyperrealistic videos generated by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/877931/bytedance-seedance-2-video-generator-ai-launch">Seedance 2.0 model</a> went viral last week, with the likeness of actors, such as Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, and characters from <a href="https://x.com/NACHOS2D_/status/2020624444344213959?s=20"><em>Dragon Ball Z</em></a>, <a href="https://x.com/aleenaamiir/status/2021900753955434844?s=20"><em>Family Guy</em></a>, and <a href="https://x.com/nasan_0422/status/2021066670668906615?s=20"><em>Pokémon</em></a>.</p><p>“ByteDance respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0,” a ByteDance spokesperson said in a statement shared by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/16/bytedance-safegaurds-seedance-ai-copyright-disney-mpa-netflix-paramount-sony-universal.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. “We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users.”</p><p>ByteDance’s response comes after receiving complaints from major studios. In a cease and desist letter sent on Friday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/879386/disney-accuses-bytedances-new-ai-video-model-of-infringing-on-its-characters">Disney accused ByteDance</a> of “hijacking” its protected characters by “reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works” that feature them. <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/paramoun-hollywood-legal-letter-bytedance-ai-seedance-1236725462/"><em>Deadline</em> reports</a> that Paramount Skydance followed with its own cease and desist letter, demanding that ByteDance remove all infringing instances of Paramount content and prevent it from being generated in the future.</p><p>Hollywood trade groups have also weighed in, including the Motion Picture Association (MPA) and SAG-AFTRA talent union. MPA CEO Charles Rivkin <a href="https://creativefirst.film/motion-picture-association-calls-for-bytedance-to-cease-seedance-2-0-infringing-activity/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">issued a statement</a> accusing ByteDance of engaging in copyright infringement at a “massive scale,” and disregarding well-established laws that underpin “millions of American jobs.” SAG-AFTRA said that its members’ voices and likenesses have been used by Seedance 2.0 without authorization.</p><p>“This is unacceptable and undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-seedance-bytedance-hollywood-copyright-7e445388401d172c6bf51d0d42aa4f24"><em>AP News</em></a>. “Seedance 2.0 disregards law, ethics, industry standards and basic principles of consent. Responsible AI development demands responsibility, and that is nonexistent here.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li><span><span><span></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div>

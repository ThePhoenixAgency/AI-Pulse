    <div><div><p>Bangladesh’s incoming prime minister Tarique Rahman and other politicians were sworn into parliament on Tuesday, becoming the first elected representatives since a deadly 2024 uprising.</p><p>Rahman is set to take over from an interim government that has led the country of 170 million people for 18 months since the autocratic government of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/sheikh-hasina">Sheikh Hasina</a> was overthrown.</p><p>The lawmakers, who promised loyalty to Bangladesh, were sworn in by the chief election commissioner, A M M Nasir Uddin.</p><p>Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) politicians were expected to formally elect Rahman as their leader, and the president, Mohammed Shahabuddin, was set to administer the oath of office to the prime minister and his ministers later on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Rahman, 60, who is the chief of the BNP and scion of one of the country’s most powerful political dynasties, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/13/bangladesh-election-bnp-wins">won a landslide victory in the 12 February elections</a>.</p><p>“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy,” he said in his victory speech on Saturday. “This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy.”</p><figure></figure><p>But he has also spoke of the challenges ahead, including tackling the economic woes of the country.</p><p>“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by the authoritarian regime, weakened constitutional and statutory institutions, and a deteriorating law and order situation”, he added.</p><p>The new leader has pledged to restore stability and revive growth after months of turmoil that rattled investor confidence in Bangladesh, the world’s second-largest garment exporter.</p><p>He has also called for all parties to “remain united” in a country polarised by years of bitter rivalry.</p><p>Rahman only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain.</p><p>The BNP coalition won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance.</p><p>Jamaat, which secured more than a quarter of seats in parliament – a four-fold increase on its previous best – have challenged results in 32 constituencies. But its leader, Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has also said the Islamist party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.</p><p>Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part in the elections.</p><p>Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal” election.</p><p>But India praised the BNP’s “decisive win” – a notable shift after deeply strained ties.</p><p>Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.</p><p>Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus – a population that makes up roughly 7% of the population in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.</p></div></div>

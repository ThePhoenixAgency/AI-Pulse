The Haiku open-source operating system project inspired by BeOS kicked off 2026 by making many improvements to its kernel, device drivers, and user-space software.
</p><p>
Haiku published their January 2026 status report to highlight the improvements they made to their open-source OS over the past month. Some of the January highlights for Haiku include:
</p><p>
- Completing the work around new touchpad functionality for Haiku. This work now allows for two-finger scrolling, edge motion, software button areas, and click finger support. Newer Elantech touchpads are now supported too.
</p><p>
- The Realtek rtl8125 driver has been synced with upstream OpenBSD for improving support for some newer networking hardware.
</p><p>
- Haiku has implemented more functionality mandated by the POSIX 2024 specification.
</p><p>
- Fixing some missing locking in the file panel constructor to fix broken open/save panel appearances throughout various apps.
</p><p>
- A disk image menu is finally added to DriveSetup so that disk images can be worked from that GUI without resorting to the command line.
</p><p>
- IPv6 support for telnet as well netstat.

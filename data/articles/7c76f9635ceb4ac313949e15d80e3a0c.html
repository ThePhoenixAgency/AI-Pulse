  </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I’m just about starting to believe that I may be heading into the final stages of an extremely lengthy attempt to sell one apartment and buy another, so I’m currently giving some thought to the smart home technology I’ll want in my new home. This will be some 13 years after I first adopted smart home tech, so I’m expecting to make a few changes – some small, one potentially much larger … I’ve been through this once before. As last time, I found that the smart home tech in my existing apartment was a very appealing selling point, and I’ve therefore again agreed to leave most of it all in place. With the exception of some wall and floor lamps I’m taking with me, then, I will need to start again in my new home. It’s been almost a decade since I last had to go through this process, and at that time I mostly opted to replicate all of the tech I already had. That remains the broad plan this time around, but I will be making a few changes. This will include taking advantage of the more sophisticated smart home technology now available, and opting for a slightly more restrained smart lighting setup. By far the biggest decision I will need to make, however, is whether to stick to the Apple Home app or to switch instead to Home Assistant. Lighting Color lighting seems to be one of the most polarizing elements in smart home setups. Some people like their entire home to be filled with color-capable lighting, while others dismiss it as a gimmick. Sometimes you only really discover what you most appreciate when you are without it for a time. That was very much the case after my last move while I was waiting to set up the smart home tech. I found that mood lighting was among the things I most missed, and most appreciated once everything was up and running again. I do very much remain a fan, although I’m not going to get quite as carried away as I have in the past. My plan this time is to have color-capable lighting for floor and table lamps as well as strip lighting in the living room, kitchen, and bedroom. All overhead lighting, however, will be white. There is talk of fairy lights rather than strip lights in the bedroom; we shall see! My existing setup extended to color lighting in the bathroom, imagining that a soft pink might make for a relaxing or romantic mood while taking a bath, but I think it’s been used in this way about twice in eight years! Motion sensors to presence sensors I currently use motion sensors to automatically switch on lighting in the kitchen and when opening the wardrobes. I very much appreciate this functionality, but since technology has moved on I’ll be looking to presence sensors this time around. If the greater precision of these works as well as I hope, I may be able to develop some more sophisticated automations, such as having my desk lighting activate when I sit in front of it. Blinds and curtains One mistake I won’t be repeating is extensive floor-to-ceiling window blinds. While I did initially love these, I subsequently hit enough issues with them to deter me from doing it again. My plan this time is to limit these to the bedroom as I do really appreciate the blind automatically opening when it’s time to wake. While I love a clean minimalist home, I am somewhat softening the look and feel this time. This will include curtains rather than blinds in the living room, and I think I’m not going to bother with motorized opening and closing for these. Because I’m opting for a double layer of curtains – one translucent and one blackout – I suspect this would be prone to reliability issues, which is not an experience I want to relive. Smart lock and doorbell Both smart lock and video doorbell have definitely earned a place in my new home. Smart lock technology has come a long way since my existing installation. Apple Key support will be non-negotiable for the lock, while HomeKit Secure Video will be a requirement for the video doorbell. Smart switches All of my lighting is controllable via smart switches, and I’ll be replicating this. My default remains voice commands to activate scenes, but there are times when it’s simply quicker to press a switch while walking into a room. Smart plugs My experience is that these have grown less and less useful as smart home tech has evolved. The only one I still use today is to allow me to switch on an electric blanket to warm up the bed in winter before getting into it. I especially appreciate the ability to do so whilst on the way home after a night out. HomePods I remain a huge fan of OG full-sized HomePods in every room. A different layout means that I may configure these differently, but a stereo pair in the living room will certainly be the starting point. Robot vacuum This is something I definitely consider an essential. I’ll be looking around to see if there have been any worthwhile improvements in functionality over my existing model. Apple TV This will be a completely new one for me. I haven’t owned a television in 26 years. That’s not because I never watch TV shows or movies, but rather because I do so relatively infrequently and really dislike the way a TV set dominates a room when it’s not being used. Even a ceiling-mounted projector was too intrusive for my minimalist tastes. However, things have changed with the advent of compact and stylish short-throw projectors, and I’m therefore planning to get one of these. It will obviously make sense to have this fed from an Apple TV 4K, so I’ll be investing in one for the first time. To switch platform or not HomeKit used to be a somewhat flaky ecosystem, with unavailable devices a depressingly common sight in the Home app. I have to say that I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen this. Today’s HomeKit mostly does live up to Apple’s promise that it Just Works. The safe and sensible decision, therefore, would be to stick within the Apple ecosystem. However … I’m a gadget guy, and there’s no denying the tech appeal of the much greater control and flexibility available through Home Assistant. At the same time, researching this does suggest that it is far from straightforward, and may be a rather more time-consuming activity than I would wish. I do kind of get the impression that one shouldn’t consider it unless you actually want it to be a hobby. I’d very much welcome input on this from anyone who has made the switch and either appreciated or regretted it – or perhaps both! Please let me know in the comments. If you have any other tips or thoughts about starting again with a new smart home, please do share those too.

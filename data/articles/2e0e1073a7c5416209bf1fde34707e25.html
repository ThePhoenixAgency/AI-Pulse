<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/BzZoo_pyWlCj6OhYRuMVEEAq--A=/400x0/article-new/2025/03/Apple-More-Personal-Siri-Ad.jpg?lossy" alt="Apple More Personal Siri Ad"><br>At WWDC in June 2024, Apple previewed two of Siri's most anticipated Apple Intelligence upgrades – personal context and onscreen awareness. The features were supposed to arrive as part of iOS 18 and were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/apple-intelligence-siri-lawsuit/">promoted</a> the same year when launching the iPhone 16 models, but Apple is still working on them. In 2025, CEO Tim Cook acknowledged in 2025 that developing a "more personal" Siri was "taking a bit longer than we thought."</p>
<p>The delay led Apple to be accused in a March 2025 lawsuit of false advertising and unfair competition. But in a Wednesday filing in San Jose federal court covered by <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-seeks-dismissal-fraud-lawsuit-over-siri-ai-epic-injunction-2026-02-26/">Reuters</a></em>, Apple argued there is no proof executives knew at the time that either feature would be significantly delayed. </p>
<p>Apple's motion also pushed back on separate claims related to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-anti-steering-injunction-violation/">Epic Games injunction</a>, which required the company to let developers link users to external purchase options outside the App Store's 30 percent commission structure. </p>
<p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found Apple in "willful violation" of that injunction last year after the company introduced a new system that still charged developers a 27 percent fee on some external sales. A federal appeals court partially reversed her sanctions in December.</p>
<p>Apple said it never guaranteed its compliance procedures would be foolproof, and argued the fraud claims were unsubstantiated.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>"It is no secret that Apple faced challenges and weathered ups and downs in its stock price in 2025, like many major companies," Apple said. "But plaintiff takes a massive and unsupported leap by claiming that securities fraud caused the temporary price drops."</p></blockquote>
<p>The lawsuit covers shareholders who suffered losses between May 2024 and May 2025 and is led by South Korea's National Pension Service, the world's third-largest pension fund. Lawyers for the shareholders have not yet responded publicly to Apple's filing.</p>
<p>Apple plans to release a more personalized version of Siri powered by Google Gemini this year. It was expected to be part of iOS 26.4, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s latest report suggests the ‌Siri‌ functionality <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/">will not be ready in time</a> to be included in it, so the new features could be pushed to iOS 26.5 or iOS 27.</p>

There are no rumors of design changes, and we are expecting the upcoming M5 MacBook Pro models to look just like the M4 versions. Apple will continue to offer 14-inch and 16-inch size options,...</p></div></main></div></div>

    <pre><code>Monday February 16, 2026 10:49 am PST by Juli CloverApple is testing secure messaging between Android and iOS devices with iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, and macOS Tahoe 26.4. The updates introduce end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for RCS messages, a security feature that is not currently available for cross-platform messaging.
Apple has been working with the GSM Association to implement E2EE for ‌RCS‌ messages. iMessage, the messaging protocol for sending texts between iPhones, has long supported end-to-end encryption. ‌RCS‌ messages between Android devices have also featured E2EE, but there was no full encryption for Android to iPhone (or vice versa) communications. With the addition of E2EE for ‌RCS‌, messages between ‌iPhone‌ users and Android users will eventually be just as secure as iMessage.
Developers running the iOS 26.4 beta will see a new switch in the Settings app that's turned on by default. The toggle enables testing end-to-end encrypted ‌RCS‌ messaging for supported devices and carriers. Most carriers that support ‌RCS‌ will also support ‌RCS‌ end-to-end encryption, according to Apple. During the first beta, ‌RCS‌ encryption is available for testing Apple devices only when iMessage is disabled. ‌iPhone‌ users who have the beta installed will see a lock icon in ‌RCS‌ chats, with the icon indicating that E2EE is enabled. The lock icon will also now appear in iMessage chats.
‌RCS‌ End-to-end encryption for Apple devices will roll out to beta users gradually, so not everyone will have access right away. Encryption will become available over time, and you can tell if it's enabled through the lock icon.
Cross-platform testing between ‌iPhone‌ users and Android users will begin at a later date. E2EE for ‌RCS‌ will require Apple to update to ‌RCS‌ Universal Profile 3.0, which the GSMA published with Apple's input. Apple currently supports ‌RCS‌ Universal Profile 2.4. ‌RCS‌ Universal Profile 3.0 will also add features for editing text messages, deleting text messages, and replying to specific messages inline during cross-platform conversations.
Apple released the first betas of iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, and ‌macOS Tahoe‌ 26.4 today, with the updates available for developers. Apple plans to launch the updates in the spring, but while E2EE is in testing, the full functionality is not expected until a later iOS 26 update.

"They have not been tortured. They have not suffered any inhumane treatment since they were captured."</p></div><div><p>The family of one of the men said they were hopeful he would be freed soon. According to the AFP news agency, 35-year-old Joshua Nkrumah left his pregnant wife in Dubai in July 2024 and travelled to Russia, believing he had secured a private security job.</p></div><div><p>He was captured by Ukrainian forces in September 2024 after surviving a drone strike. Nkrumah remains in detention, and his family has had no contact with him since.</p></div><div><p>Joshua's father, Albert, told AFP that he sometimes wondered if his son was dead or alive.</p></div><div><p>"As a father, I live every day with a silent weight on my chest. I wake up and the first thing I think about is my son - whether he has eaten, whether he is safe, whether he still has hope," he added.</p></div><div><p>"I just want my son alive and back home. That is all a father asks."</p></div><div><p>Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said both sides discussed "frankly" about the possibility of returning the prisoners to Ghana.</p></div><div><p>South Africa on Thursday said that two of its citizens had been killed in Ukraine, while another 15 had been repatriated over the past week. Two more remain in Russia getting treatment for "very severe" injuries, said Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola.</p></div><div><p>Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia would be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out was to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.</p></div><div><p>Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.</p></div><div><p></p><h2>You may also be interested in:</h2><p></p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa"><span>Getty Images/BBC</span></p></div></figure></div><div><p><span>BBC Africa podcasts</span></p></div></article></div></div>

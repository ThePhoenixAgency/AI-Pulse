I heard the opposition claim - this clause or that clause. Anything would have to be under ASIO advice. Of course, of course, intelligence agencies said the different part of the Passports Act had been act we would respond to that, if they had intelligence to that effect. But <strong>the claims from the opposition that somehow the standard right for any citizen to have a passport has been suspended here just plain wrong and they know that.</strong></p> <p>…There’s been no advice from ASIO that the Passports Act provisions have been activated. There has been advice for one of the people that has come to me that the threshold for a temporary exclusion order has been activated and I have acted on that and issued the temporary exclusion order. One of my concerns with how the opposition have handled this is they have effectively said the Minister be able to make it up. <strong>Michaelia Cash</strong> did a long media release saying, “This is all the minister needs to do”, as though somehow in national security portfolio you should ignore your national security intelligence and law enforcement agencies.</p>

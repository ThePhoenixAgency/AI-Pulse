<p>A new display feature designed to stop people from peeking at your screen could eventually reach MacBooks. Reports say Apple is studying Samsung’s upcoming privacy display technology and plans to introduce a similar system in future laptops, which would give users stronger protection while reading messages, banking, or handling personal work in public spaces.</p>

<p>The feature first appears on Samsung’s next flagship phone and focuses on limiting screen visibility from side angles. When enabled, only the person directly facing the screen sees clear content while others nearby see blurred or darkened visuals. This directly targets a common annoyance in cafés, flights, and offices where sensitive information often stays exposed.</p>

<p>According to market research firm Omdia, <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2023203347390681414">shared</a> by tipster <em>Ice Universe</em>, Apple intends to adopt the technology for MacBooks around 2029. The report states the system used in the Galaxy S26 Ultra will also be “applied to Apple MacBook laptops by 2029.”</p>

<h2>How the Privacy Display Works</h2>

<p>Samsung’s solution combines hardware and software. It relies on Flex Magic Pixel display technology that manipulates viewing angles and can selectively hide information depending on where a person looks from.</p>

<p>Users will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable privacy mode across the entire screen</li>

<li>Restrict visibility only inside certain apps</li>

<li>Protect a selected portion of the display</li>

<li>Turn the feature off instantly when sharing content</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach matters because many privacy tools today rely only on dimming or blur filters, which still leak information from certain angles.</p>

<p>What It Means for MacBooks</p>

<p>Apple usually integrates hardware features tightly into macOS, so a Mac version would likely appear as a built-in privacy control rather than a simple toggle. The company may reserve it for high-end MacBook Pro models or even sell it as an optional display upgrade similar to its nano-texture screen option.</p>

<p>The idea also fits Apple’s focus on on-device security. While the feature alone will not drive laptop sales, it solves a real everyday problem for students, office workers, and travelers who frequently work around strangers.</p>

<p>Samsung will officially unveil the Galaxy S26 series soon, and if the technology proves useful, it could become a standard privacy feature across laptops in the next few years.</p>

<div> <hr><ul><li><strong>A new Galaxy Buds 4 leak suggests an expected feature isn't coming</strong></li><li><strong>Images suggest Galaxy Buds 4's case won't sport a built-in speaker grille</strong></li><li><strong>…the one that would emit sound to help you find your lost earbuds </strong></li><li><strong>It's unclear whether they'll land at Unpacked next week, but fans aren't happy </strong></li></ul><hr><p>We’re just over a week away from the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/5-things-to-expect-at-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-and-5-things-we-probably-wont-see">Samsung Galaxy Unpacked</a> event on February 25 and, thanks to recent leaks, we have a rough idea of what to expect from the anticipated Galaxy Buds 4 — but new images reveal something quite unfortunate.</p><p>If you’ve been keeping up, you’ll know that the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are set to make their grand debut at the next <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/samsung">Samsung</a> event, and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/earbuds-airpods/the-samsung-buds-4-pro-design-leaks-yet-again-in-all-its-glory-but-i-tested-the-buds-3-pro-and-i-hope-samsung-fixes-one-invisible-flaw">based on a recent slew of leaks</a>, it appears they won’t look too different from Galaxy Buds 3 except that the angular stem design will be phased out. However, there’s one device-finding upgrade we thought we were getting that Samsung has appeared to drop.</p><p>The eagle-eyed audiophiles over at <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-buds-4-lack-charging-case-speaker-finding-feature/#goog_rewarded" target="_blank">SamMobile </a>spotted an X post (see below) with new images of the next generation of Galaxy Buds. According to the leak, Samsung has chosen to get rid of the charging case’s built-in speaker which would allow you to listen out for your earbuds when you’ve lost them — a feature that would've been a valuable upgrade.</p><div><blockquote><p>Galaxy Buds 4 &amp; Buds 4 Pro Renders Leaked Entire design, box content, Buds shape, case lid and form factor revealed First detailed look from all anglesBoth should be available in Black &amp; White Follow for more #GalaxyBuds4 #Samsung pic.twitter.com/dASG5bpmWN<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2023285732224413869" target="_blank">February 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote></div><p>This contradicts previous leaks spotted by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-pro-design-features-leak-3616254/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> back in November 2025, which was the first shared findings of what was assumed to be a new speaker grille next to what looks like the charging port and device-pairing button (see below). That no longer seems to be the case, which is rather disappointing especially since rival models have already mastered this.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwncGQRiyP3pomT8oAruo.png" alt="A leaked image showing what the Galaxy Buds 4 could look like">
</p></div><figcaption><span>Android Authority found that the charging case may feature a new speaker (top left), but new leaks suggest this isn't certain </span><span>(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the case of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/earbuds-airpods/airpods-4-review">AirPods 4</a> for example, the Find My feature lets you track your missing AirPods by triggering a ringing sound which the case will emit. However, that’s just the tip of the iceberg — the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/airpods-pro-2">AirPods Pro 2 </a>literally points you in the direction of your earbuds.</p><p>As far as Galaxy Unpacked goes, earbuds aren’t the only thing Samsung users are excited to see. Additionally, it’s expected that the company will be unveiling new models joining the lineup of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>, including the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-could-be-the-perfect-mobile-movie-machine-and-i-cant-wait-to-try-it-out"> Galaxy Trifold</a> — but it’s the Galaxy Buds 4 speculation that’s had audio fans itching for new hardware upgrades.</p><h2>'They never get the case right' </h2><p>Aside from the design changes to the case, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1r64f0n/every_pic_of_galaxy_buds4_and_buds4_pro_leaked/" target="_blank">which users online haven’t held back from slandering</a>, the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are expected to lift a number of flaws from the last lineup — at least we hope they do.</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><p>As per previous generations, it’s likely that the next edition of the standard Galaxy Buds will have the flat, AirPods-style tip, while the next Galaxy Buds Pro will be fitted with silicone eartips, but whether or not Samsung will <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/earbuds-airpods/the-samsung-buds-4-pro-design-leaks-yet-again-in-all-its-glory-but-i-tested-the-buds-3-pro-and-i-hope-samsung-fixes-one-invisible-flaw">fix its tedious eartip hooking system</a> is another question.</p><p>On the other hand, now that Samsung is getting rid of the triangular earbud stems this should make it easier for users to conduct swiping and pinching gestures for altering the volume and pausing audio — something we found quite fiddly in the Galaxy Buds 3.</p><p>The situation with the speaker grille on the Galaxy Buds 4 is still very much a mystery, and if we are to look at the leaks alone, they suggest this feature won’t be part of the next line of Galaxy Buds. That said, we wouldn’t rule out the possibility of Samsung throwing a surprise our way but right now, we’ll just have to wait and see what comes our way on February 25.</p><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n8EtGZBZ8P2Jao8LdhZkae.png" alt="Technics EAH-AZ100"></div></figure></div><hr><p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

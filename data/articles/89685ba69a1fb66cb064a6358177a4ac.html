    <div><div> <p>Thames Valley Police said it was "assessing" allegations that the former prince sent trade reports to convicted sex offender <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jeffrey-epstein/" target="_self">Jeffrey Epstein</a> in 2010.</p> <p>UK police arrested Andrew on suspicion of misconduct at his new home in Sandringham in Norfolk. It came after a fresh cache of documents published earlier this month by the US Justice Department appeared to show that Andrew sent Epstein potentially confidential documents during his time as a <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/united-kingdom/" target="_self">UK</a> trade envoy.</p> <p>At least nine separate UK police forces have confirmed they were assessing reports which appear to link the former prince to Epstein.</p> <p>In a November 2010 email seen by AFP and sent while he was trade envoy, Andrew appeared to share with Epstein reports on Vietnam, Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Singapore following an official visit to Asia.</p> <p>He also reportedly sent the American financier details of the trip – on which he was accompanied by Epstein's business associates – along with investment opportunities months later.</p> <h2>Titles stripped</h2> <p>Mountbatten-Windsor had already been <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20251030-king-charles-to-remove-prince-andrew-s-royal-titles-and-honours-buckingham-palace-says" target="_self">stripped of all of his titles</a> last year by his brother <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/king-charles-iii/" target="_self">King Charles III</a> and ousted from his home on the Windsor estate to a remote corner of rural England.</p> <p>The man who once swanned around the world in private jets, staying at luxury hotels and palaces, was in custody and likely to spend his 66th birthday on Thursday inside a police cell.&nbsp;</p> <p>Andrew was already deeply unpopular with the British public, with an October YouGov poll finding that 91 percent had a negative opinion of him. Dubbed "Randy Andy" by the British tabloids, he once led a gilded life as the favourite son of the late <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/" target="_self">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.</p> <p>But shocking revelations about his relationship with Epstein and the illegal actions he allegedly participated in have likely sullied his reputation beyond repair.</p> <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/keir-starmer/" target="_self">Keir Starmer</a> has indicated that Andrew should testify to the US Congress about his ties to Epstein.</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d204af8-0d88-11f1-8326-005056bfb2b6/w:980/8e317b7373acc9d22ed0a8b974fcd78879f34935.jpg" alt="Andrew's popularity rating is at an all-time low"> <figcaption> <span>Andrew's popularity rating is at an all-time low</span> <span> JUSTIN TALLIS / AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Born on February 19, 1960, at Buckingham Palace, in his younger years the British public adored the handsome prince and helicopter pilot who fought in the 1982 <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/falklands/" target="_self">Falklands</a> War against <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/argentina/" target="_self">Argentina</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>He was seen as fun and comfortable around people, unlike his stuffier older brother Charles.</p> <p>But as his excesses went unchecked and times and attitudes changed, the public grew tired of his behaviour and then increasingly angry.</p> <p>The re-emergence of allegations that he had had sex with Virginia Giuffre, a trafficking victim of Epstein, on three separate occasions, including twice when she was just 17, reignited public outrage. He <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20220215-prince-andrew-settles-sex-assault-lawsuit-with-virginia-giuffre-through-substantial-donation" target="_self">settled with Giuffre for an unspecified sum</a>.</p> <p>The scandal has only snowballed since then. The latest release in January of the "Epstein files" included a picture of Andrew leaning over a woman lying on the floor.</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e078c082-004d-11f1-a356-005056bf30b7/w:980/b8bfd10af55131fa817ac260fad3b586c4d7edfd.jpg" alt="Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's reputation was dealt new blows following the latest Epstein files release"> <figcaption> <span>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's reputation was dealt new blows following the latest Epstein files release</span> <span> Handout / US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE/AFP/File</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Andrew has been a persistent source of embarrassment for the monarchy.</p> <p>A devastating 2019 television interview in which he defended his friendship with Epstein, and failed to express any sympathy for his victims, further humiliated the family.</p> <p>He also faced ridicule after countering a claim that he had been "profusely sweating" during an alleged encounter with Giuffre, saying he could not sweat because of a medical condition.</p> <p>Andrew was stripped of his military and His Royal Highness (HRH) titles in 2022 and shuffled off into retirement after being sued by Giuffre and paying her a multi-million pound settlement, even though he did not admit any fault.</p> <p>Giuffre, a US and Australian citizen, at her farm in Western Australia in April last year in what was ruled a suicide.</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20251021-virginia-giuffre-shines-light-on-epstein-ordeal-in-new-memoir" target="_self">Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir shines new light on Epstein ordeal</a></p> <h2>'Playboy prince'</h2> <p>Internationally, Andrew was once best known for his 1986 wedding to the fun-loving Sarah Ferguson, known as Fergie.</p> <p>Bubbly, friendly Sarah had been considered an ideal match for Andrew, who had a reputation as a "playboy prince".</p> <p>The couple have two daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie.</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/91a0f16e-b651-11f0-96be-005056bf30b7/w:980/d2d2bfaba3a3de8e9941c3d01311d62efa5a67bc.jpg" alt="Andrew shares a joke with Sarah Ferguson at an event in 1995"> <figcaption> <span>Andrew shares a joke with Sarah Ferguson at an event in 1995</span> <span> DAVID GILES, - / PA/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>But by 1992 the pair had split amicably, contributing to what the late queen Elizabeth II called her "<em>annus horribilis</em>". They finalised their divorce in 1996.</p> <p>Andrew left the Royal Navy in 2001, after 22 years of service as a helicopter pilot, and became a special government trade envoy until 2011, earning a new nickname – "Air Miles Andy" – as he jetted around the world at the taxpayers' expense.</p> <p>Questions also piled up about his judgement after links to various dictators emerged, and he faced repeated criticism of being brash, arrogant and rude.</p> <p>King Charles finally moved into action in October, stripping his brother of his royal titles and ousting him from his home on the Windsor estate.</p> <p>Ferguson, whose reputation has also been tarnished by revelations from the Epstein files, was also stripped of her title of duchess and left to seek a new home on her own.</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AFP)</em></p> </div></div>

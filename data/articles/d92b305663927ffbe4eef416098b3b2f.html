<h3><span>SJCAM C400: one-minute review</span></h3><p>The SJCAM C400 is an ultra-compact action camera that comes with an optional handle accessory, transforming it from a tiny wearable cam into a handheld vlogging setup. Starting at around $160 / £155 (without the handle), it undercuts the latest offerings from <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dji">DJI</a> and Insta360 by a significant margin — but unfortunately, you get what you pay for.</p><p>When slotted into the handle, the C400 takes on a whole new character, becoming a comfortable handheld vlogging camera with a rotatable screen that works for both horizontal and vertical content, with the added benefit of an extra battery.</p><p>However, image quality is where the C400 seriously stumbles. Despite supporting <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/4k">4K</a> at 30fps and various video modes, the footage is poor, with an odd combination of over-sharpening and under-detail, plus prominent muddy digital artifacts. Still photos don't fare much better, with detail falling off drastically towards the frame edges. When compared directly to footage from an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/action-cameras/insta-360-go-ultra-review">Insta360 GO Ultra</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/action-cameras/dji-osmo-nano-review">DJI Osmo Nano</a>, the difference is stark — and it becomes immediately clear why those cameras cost a little more.</p><p>Audio quality doesn't help matters. While the built-in microphone copes indoors or in calm conditions, it struggles with wind noise, and there's no option to connect an external mic.</p><p>The digital stabilization works, but in an artificial way that draws attention to itself, while enabling horizon leveling drastically reduces resolution. There's also no built-in waterproofing or magnetic mounting — both missed opportunities on a camera this size.</p><p>On the plus side, battery life is impressive, with the camera managing around 190 minutes of 4K recording on its own, and much longer when docked in the handle.</p><p>In short, the C400 offers an appealingly compact form factor and decent battery life at a bargain price, but its poor image and audio quality make it hard to recommend unless budget is your absolute priority. I'd recommend checking out one of my recommended alternatives in my <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-action-camera">best action cameras</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-vlogging-camera">best vlogging camera</a> guides.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JxkgAffpmUhjYcyjncvzGg.jpg" alt="SJCAM C400 action camera">
</p></div><figcaption><span>The core camera unit is small and lightweight, and unlike its rivals has room for a functional touchscreen on its front </span><span>(Image credit: Future | Sam Kieldsen)</span></figcaption></figure><h3><span>SJCAM C400: price and availability</span></h3><ul><li><strong>Priced from $159 / £153</strong></li><li><strong>Sold with and without handle</strong></li><li><strong>A range of accessories is available</strong></li></ul><p>The SJCAM C400 is available in three bundles: the C400 Pocket (just the camera with no handle or accessories); the C400 (which includes the handle); and the C400 Vlogging Bundle (which includes the handle, a mini tripod, a pendant mount, a 64GB microSD card and a carry case). Prices vary wildly depending on the bundle and the country you're shopping in, and seem to be fluctuating too, so I would suggest shopping around to ensure you get the best price for whatever package you're after.</p><p>In terms of value the camera seems like a bargain in comparison to the latest models from rival companies like DJI and Insta360. But considering its level of performance, I think you should seriously consider spending a little more elsewhere, particularly if you value image quality.</p><h3><span>SJCAM C400: specs</span></h3><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><caption>SJCAM C400 specs</caption><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Sensor</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>1/2.8-inch CMOS</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Max Resolution</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>24MP photos<br>4K 30fps footage</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Weight</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>189g / 7oz (with handle); 54g / 1.9oz (camera only)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Dimensions</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>143.5 x 38.5 x 38.5mm (with handle); 68 x 32 x 25.5mm (camera only)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Displays</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>1.3-inch (camera); 2.29-inch (handle)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Operating Time</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Camera: 190 mins<br>Camera + handle: 420 mins</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Connectivity</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB-C</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Storage</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>microSD card up to 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Waterproofing</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h3><span>SJCAM C400: design</span></h3><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>4</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jF8KvNo6tJzMa9qwtnopSg.jpg" alt="SJCAM C400 action camera"></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future | Sam Kieldsen)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>The main C400 camera is charmingly tiny and lightweight, if not quite as small as the DJI Osmo Nano or some of the Insta360 Go editions; if you really must have the tiniest, lightest 4K action cam, the C400 isn't it. Still, for POV filming purposes I found it compact enough to wear on a pendant around my neck, or fixed to my hat, without causing any bother whatsoever.</p><p>The camera unit has a small touchscreen (which is a huge boon – you don't get one on the DJI Osmo Nano or Insta360 Go), built-in microphone, microSD card slot for storage, and a tiny button that handles power and shutter duties. Sadly, unlike some rivals, it doesn't include a magnet for fixing it easily to metal surfaces, which is a missed opportunity.</p><p>Another missed opportunity is waterproofing, which I'd expect on a small action camera. Sadly, it's not mentioned anywhere on the spec or features sheet, although an optional waterproof case (with a 30m depth rating) is available.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zc3Rwa7LiPqz8Ghi7cmSg.jpg" alt="SJCAM C400 action camera">
</p></div><figcaption><span>The optional pendant mount also includes a magnetic clip add-on for the C400. </span><span>(Image credit: Future | Sam Kieldsen)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the C400 is slotted into the handle it takes on a whole new character, transforming from mini cam into a handheld vlogging camera somewhat reminiscent of the DJI Osmo Pocket series. The handle has a pleasingly comfortable design, and its good-sized rotatable screen caters to both horizontal and vertical content, and it also gives recording time a boost with its own supplementary battery.</p><p>I preferred using the camera in this arrangement than on its own, due to it being easy to hold and control – even if it clearly lacks the physical gimbal-based stabilization of DJI's Pocket range.</p><p>Additionally, it works as a wireless remote control for the camera, with a range of around 30 feet.</p><p>A quick word on the companion app: it's pretty good! Once it was installed and I'd established a Wi-Fi link between the C400 and my iPhone, I was able to remotely control the camera and download photos and videos wirelessly. Getting the phone and camera linked up the first time was a bit of a struggle, but once the connection was set up I was able to simply re-connect by scanning a QR code on the camera's screen.</p><h3><span>SJCAM C400: Performance</span></h3><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>5</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WcnkVitrcsgvzuDCjtSM4Y.jpg" alt="SJCAM C400 sample photo"></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future | Sam Kieldsen)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>The camera supports 4K video capture at up to 30fps, 2K at up to 60fps, and 1080p at up to 120fps (for slow-motion playback), plus H.264 and H.265 compression, a 'wide dynamic range' mode and a high-bitrate recording option.</p><p>Despite selecting all of these in an attempt to see the C400 performing at its best, I found image quality to be disappointingly poor even in good outdoor lighting, and even worse indoors.</p><p>You can view my sample video below to get a clearer picture (no pun intended), but the image seems to me to be a curious mix of being simultaneously over-sharpened and under-detailed, with distracting, muddy digital artifacts very prominent.</p><p>Still photos didn't impress either, with detail falling off massively towards the edges of the frame – and there's a huge amount of wide-angle distortion that doesn't appear to be correctable outside of post-production manual tweaking.</p><p>The two forms of digital image stabilization on offer — general and horizon leveling — do work, but they do so in an artificial way that really draws attention to the fact that they're working. Using horizon leveling also reduces the resolution quite drastically.</p><p>When compared to the videos straight out of an Insta360 GO Ultra or DJI Osmo Nano, the difference is stark – and it's immediately clear where that extra money goes.</p><p>Audio quality is passable in calm conditions, but as my video illustrates, the built-in microphone doesn't cope well with wind noise at all — and there's no way to connect an external microphone to better capture sound. So vloggers may have to record their audio separately, then sync it in post-production, which is hardly the sort of simplicity you'd hope for.</p><p>There's better news on the battery life front, at least, and I was impressed by the C400's stamina. To test it, I set video quality to 4K at 30fps and left the C400 (without its handle) recording. It managed to capture around 190 minutes of footage before the battery died. When docked inside the handle, it of course lasts even longer, and in my test it lasted 420 minutes in total.</p><h3><span>Should I buy the SJCAM C400?</span></h3><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ZASBAgCpqFVTZYQB6miNg.jpg" alt="SJCAM C400 action camera">

<p>Insta360 Go Ultra</p> </div>
<div> <p>The latest model in the long-running Go series of ultra-compact action cameras, the Ultra is a little larger than some of its predecessors, but makes up for it with its superb 4K 60fps (or 30fps in Active HDR) footage. It's surprisingly capable in low light, and waterproof to boot.</p>

<div>
<p>DJI Osmo Nano</p> </div>
<div> <p>Despite being DJI's first serious attempt at an ultra-compact action camera, the Osmo Nano is a waterproof modular marvel with stabilized 4K 60fps video that excels for sports and vlogging, and even supports 10-bit D-Log M. It's pricier than the C400, but still cheap for what it offers.</p>

The sample was supplied by SJCAM, and included not only the camera and handle, but a waterproof case and range of mounting options such as a magnetic pendant. I tested all its main functions including electronic image stabilization and battery life, before transferring all photos and videos to my iPhone and subsequently MacBook Air for close inspection.</p><p><em>First reviewed February 2026</em></p>

We are publishing shows to both Changelogging &amp; Friends and to Justin’s Breaking Change/Hot fix/Merge Conflict… I don’t know what this is on his pod, but it’ll be there. The explicit version will be over on Justin’s side. On our side, there will be bleeps, because we also have not just Justin, but also Mike McQuaid with us. What’s up, Mike?</p> </div> <div> <p>Thanks for having me. I hope to make heavy use of your bleep count today, as it’s my Scottish self-employed tradition.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, Mike’s only requirement was that there would become a non-bleeped version of his voice out there on the internet talking about this, and so Justin will happily oblige.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yes, and I’m not going to make it a contest or anything, but I’ve got a feeling I’m not going to go bleep-free for what we’re about to talk about.</p> </div> <div>
<p>And the reason for the bleeps is because we’ve got trouble right here at Ruby Central… Yes, that’s an old music man?</p>
<p>What is that? I don’t know…</p> </div> <div> <p>…for a new problem – maybe not a new problem, an old problem; an issue that’s been going on with Ruby Gems, with Ruby Central, with Ruby Together… With Ruby, the community, more so than the programming language. The language is doing just fine, isn’t it, Mike?</p> </div> <div> <p>It seems to be. I wrote some today, it still works…</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] Did you install any gems?</p> </div> <div> <p>I did. They installed okay. It seems to be fine.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, I was actually doing an iOS project when all this stuff broke, but then I was worried that Ruby would stop working… So I dropped that, switched gears, and now I’ve been working on my posse party project in earnest, to try to get it done before the servers turn off…</p> </div> <div> <p>Just in case, just in case. Well, there’s a lot of ins, a lot of outs, a lot of what have yous, as the dude would say, to this particular story… More probably than I can summarize, which is why I’ve mostly ignored this in Changelog News, because there’s just so much going on, and every once in a while I just link over to Justin, who’s been commentating and color commentating… But we’re going to let Mike try to set the table for us, just some of the events that’s going on, for those who are uninitiated with some of the Ruby drama that’s been percolating and coming to a head recently with an actual root access event published on RubyGems.org. So Mike, help everybody understand exactly what’s been going down.</p> </div> <div>
<p>Yeah, so I guess things kicked off probably – where we are… We’re October 15th at the time of recording. So this time a month ago, things seemed to all be fairly normal, and stable, and whatever. No one seemed to really know much.</p>
<p>I guess my first personal involvement was there was a governance PR on Ruby Gems that was based on the Homebrew one, I was pulled in and asked to kind of give my thoughts on that… And then a few people started messaging me, and whatever. But essentially what went down is Ruby Central, for the main parties involved here, is the non-profit organization that controls RubyGems.org… And they had as employees and contractors at various points various maintainers of Ruby Gems, the open source project, and those people were involved with RubyGems.org kind of on-call rotations, and whatever. So essentially, kind of, I guess, last month, we’re talking I think September the 18th or whatever - from then onwards, over the kind of following few weeks, Ruby Central notified Ruby Gems maintainers, including I guess Andre Arko… I guess if you want to read the two differences of accounts, I guess the starkest extremes here are Andrei’s written a few things on his blog, Ruby Gems have written a few things on their blog… And basically, from September the 18th onwards, Andrei and some other Ruby Gems maintainers were removed from the on-call rotation, they were removed from their GitHub access, and various bits and pieces went down.</p>
<p>There is kind of back and forward and arguments and disputes about what was communicated exactly by who, and when, and what happened, and what didn’t happen, and whatever… But essentially, we’re at the point today where almost no one who is involved with Ruby Gems the open source project has access to be involved with it today. Andrei and a bunch of the other Ruby Gems maintainers have created their own thing called gem.coop, which right now is essentially a modified version/fork, whatever you want to call it, of RubyGems.org. It’s run as separate infrastructure.</p>
<p>Andrei has personally been involved with kind of some competitors, Bundler, and Ruby Gems, and whatever, I think there’s a tool called Rv… And what seems to be now public knowledge is that both parties are writing various blog posts, [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:06:51.05">00:06:51.05</a>] and it sounds there’s some kind of lawsuits in action between various parties as well. Does that provide the overview you’re looking for, Jerod, or do you want a bit more color on particular bits?</p> </div> <div> <p>I think that’s a good overview. I think that brings us to what seems to be the biggest milestone, or moment, which was published just last week by Shan Cureton, executive director at Ruby Central, of this AWS root access event that happened in September. Justin, do you want to hop in here on that? …or do you want Mike to continue?</p> </div> <div>
<p>Yeah, so if you had been following along, the thing that everybody had been clamoring for, kind of regardless – like, people are taking sides. There’s a lot of – even though we’re not public figures, we’re not famous people, Ruby’s been a smallish pond for a long time. A lot of these people have been there for 20 plus years, and everybody kind of knows everybody if you go to the conferences, and we’ve all seen each other, and people talk, and there’s different clicks and there’s different groups. And so regardless of where your allegiances fall in terms of what friend group is sort of thinking this way or that way, and where things line up, in general, I’m talking about a universe of two hundred people max. And way more people in the world use Ruby, and also read the Internet. And so they’ve been operating under this complete lack of complete just information of “What’s the whole story? Something isn’t adding up here.”</p>
<p>Some people have been happy to fill the void with sort of conspiratorial thinking throughout, “This is all a takeover from Shopify, because they’re trying to get after this one guy.” And it’s “Okay, so why?” and then no one’s got an answer for that. And other people are just very honestly and earnestly being “Ruby Central’s saying that they just removed everyone for supply chain reasons. Why?” And Ruby Central is not talking, right? And all you get is a kind of hand-wavy, “Oh, well, because the lawyer is telling us we can’t”, or something that, if you ask people. This blog post, which - what was it? Was it the 30th? No, it was more recently. It was about the event on the third.</p> </div> <div> <p>It was published October 9th, 2025.</p> </div> <div> <p>October 9th. Thanks.</p> </div> <div> <p>But the event might have been the 30th… No, on the 30th was the blog post that raised concerns.</p> </div> <div>
<p>That’s So part of why this is confusing is the post is a timeline, but the timeline is three timelines in reverse order, to first talk about the last thing that happened, and in what order things happened when the last thing happened… And then the next section explains the why behind that, and then the next last section is the why behind that… And if you were to – and this is why as soon as I read it, I put up my own blog post, I kind of tried to unspool it, to explain what are the stakes.</p>
<p>What this reads to me when you go through it – so I’ll first try to summarize. It’s characterized as a post-mortem of a security incident response, where on September 30th a person named Joel Draper - or Draper - posts a blog post that says “Yo, Andre Arko still has all these systems accesses. He’s the only owner of a particular GitHub organization, he’s still got these AWS accesses…” And I think that the if not expressly stated implication of the post is “This is how incompetent Ruby Central is, that here we are, weeks after supposedly having these accesses removed, he actually still has this access, and so look at how insecure this is. This is Ruby Central not having their act together.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Because they had taken access away from Andre as well as other rubygems.org maintainers prior. However, Andre still had access, according to Joel Draper’s – Drapper? Draper?</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s two p’s.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s two p’s, but Joel Draper just sounds more natural, so I don’t know…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. And my wife and I are rewatching Mad Men, coincidentally…</p> </div> <div> <p>Don Draper.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yes. And so it’s just really hard to separate.</p> </div> <div> <p>I agree. I haven’t seen it for years, but I’m still saying Draper. Anywho… This post that he says on September 30th is that they’re so – I mean, the implication is that the incompetence of Ruby Central, who is the… Is it a foundation? Is it a nonprofit? Help us understand some of the entities here. Ruby Central - is it a for profit?</p> </div> <div>
<p>My understanding is it’s a 501(c)3, which frankly, I really wish I didn’t know about US nonprofit organizations, considering I don’t live there and I never will… But yet, I’ve been involved with open source nonprofit stuff long enough that I’m, sadly, intimately aware. So a 501(c)3, they’re somewhat hard to establish nowadays, because various government agencies have decided that open source software is a bit too easy to look businessy.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s an organization that exists to own the assets of Ruby Gems. It merged previously with Ruby Together, which was started by Andre. I don’t know who started Ruby Central personally, but basically, it exists as an entity to provide legal ownership of the service, to provide the ability to receive tax-free donations from individuals and companies, and then redistribute those to whatever nonprofit appropriate areas that they do… Which has been Ruby Gems maintenance, Ruby Gems on call, some conferences etc.</p> </div> <div> <p>And there’s a lot of moving parts, which makes this hard to track. There’s the repos on GitHub, there’s the servers that are actually running said code, there’s the access to the servers, there’s databases, there’s other things that make this just really hard to track. So that’s Ruby Central, the entity. Back to where Justin was - they published this post about Joel Drapper’s post, saying that Andre still had access, or implying that there was still access…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, so before the post-post - don’t worry, they actually were notified of this permissions exposure.</p> </div> <div> <p>So it wasn’t a zero day announcement.</p> </div> <div> <p>No. Yeah, it looks like they had seven minutes, where Andre emailed them that he still had these accesses, and that this was the only disclosure.</p> </div> <div> <p>Gotcha.</p> </div> <div>
<p>Joel Post goes up at <a href="#t=5:30">5:30</a> UTC. And now this is Justin, the guy – I’m just reading a blog post; forgive me if my characterizations are at all inaccurate. At that point, Ruby Central has to treat it like a security incident, so they go into emergency mode, try to lock down all these systems, initiate password reset, and then begin a relatively long investigation of all these other knock on systems, first over the next few hours, and them the next few days.</p>
<p>When they backtrack – so that’s September 30th. Then there’s an analysis of events that goes back and says “Hey, look, on September 18th Ruby Central notified Mr. Arko via email that he was going to have his access removed, or that it had been removed”, and while they removed his particular IAM, I assume, AWS account that presumably would be tied to his email address, they did not rotate the password on the AWS root account. So if you’re familiar with AWS, there’s typically an email address and a root password – or an email address that is effectively the root account. And it’s bad practice to use that thing and log in as it, because you don’t have any of the sort of policies and procedures available to you. But because Andre was one of, if not the core operator of RubyGems.org for so long, it appears that even though that he was removed from whatever their password vault system was - presumably a 1Password - he had a separate copy of that password or that login item somewhere… Because even though his individual AWS account was apparently according to Ruby Central disabled, it looks like roughly eight hours after that notice sent they state that an unauthorized actor from San Francisco logged into that AWS account, into the root AWS account, and then proceeded to change the password. And as far as they know, didn’t do anything else. I’m not an expert in cloud forensics, so I have no idea if that’s a thing that Ruby Central – it’s just the absence of evidence that’s leading them to say that, or whether they have any sort of just positive proof that nothing bad happened…</p> </div> <div> <p>I think I read somewhere that there’s some sort of immutable time-based log, and they confirmed from the log what had happened, what hadn’t happened.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah… I read both sides of that, and I think what Mike just stated seemed like it was more informed than the ulterior… Which is once you have root access, you can change everything. I don’t know AWS well enough to confirm or deny a side, but that did at the time of my reading seem to be the most reasonable stance, that they could confirm it. That being said, I also don’t know for sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, I pride myself in my ignorance when it comes to DevOps stuff, so I’ll take your word for it.</p> </div> <div> <p>Same. Especially AWS stuff.</p> </div> <div>
<p>I think the thing that jumps out at me with a lot of this stuff is you can plausibly see why both sides thought they were doing the right thing a lot of times in this. From, I guess, Andre’s perspective, what’s been published is he says “Well, I didn’t have enough information to go on that this wasn’t was a legitimate event, and it wasn’t someone at Ruby Central’s email, or GitHub account, or whatever had been hacked… So I was trying to do what I could to preserve the integrity of the service.”</p>
<p>But I think what is hard for me with the communication of both sides, I think particularly unsurprisingly now that maybe some lawyers are involved, is that I would love to – maybe it’s just because I’m British… I would love a bit more from both sides, and saying “Hey, it turns out in hindsight I didn’t do the best thing here. And going forward, if you find yourself in the situation I was in, my advice to you is to do X instead of Y, and I did Y.” I think that’s the hard thing with all this, is that we’re now at a point where – there seems to be some degree of stability, and it doesn’t seem like Ruby Central is going to be inviting the folks who have left, including Andre, back into the fold anytime soon. It doesn’t seem that Andre &amp; Co are going to take control over Ruby Gems GitHub.org or whatever, anytime soon. But I feel like the main parties who suffered through this are people in the Ruby community, of which I include myself, who just have a lot of uncertainty of what’s going on.</p>
<p>I can’t remember if I said this publicly or privately, but essentially, the person I feel the most for is anyone in the last month who is trying to pitch a new Ruby project at work to a management or leadership team who looks at Hacker News even once a week. Good luck, because a whole lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt has come into this. And also, I think both sides, I see – I’m a strong proponent of… You know, I wrote a post a few years ago, which some people hate, some people love, called “Open Source Maintainers Owe You Nothing”, which points out from a legal liability perspective, essentially every open source license says “If you don’t like the terms that I’m providing you here, you can go f*** yourself, and just take what you’re given, and like it.” And from that perspective, I am sympathetic, and I tend towards my sympathy being towards the maintainers. But at the same time, we have a critical part of the Ruby ecosystem which essentially had no governance process, no public governance process whatsoever, that had and still has to some degree, very little beyond the legal required levels of financial transparency, required of like a 501(c)3, and a lot of figures making decisions and making statements where most people I don’t know who this person is. I don’t know who this person is, how they got access, who’s right, who’s wrong… Are my Ruby gems safe, or unsafe, or whatever? And I think that’s the part about this, what I find really frustrating, is that a whole lot of people in the Ruby ecosystem are still being disrupted by this, and it doesn’t seem like it’s going to get solved anytime soon, maybe ever. Because right now, both parties are now just in damage control. And again, both sides on – I had someone that was on BlueSky, or Mastodon, or whatever, who was basically “Oh, blah, blah, blah, you seem to have switched sides on this.” And I’m like “Well, I don’t think –” I mean, rarely in life is there a situation where side A is a hundred percent right, side B is a hundred percent wrong… But this is definitely a situation where that’s not the case. Both sides have made mistakes. You may well be inclined more towards one side than the other, but both sides have to do things to repair trust, and fix things, and improve things moving forward.</p> </div> <div> <p>Right.</p> </div> <div>
<p>I would just jump in real quick - sorry, Mike - because I wanted to point out two of the things from this timeline, and then we can move on to the bigger conversation. Open source maintainers who have an MIT license indeed owe you nothing. However, part of the complexity here is what’s in their dispute. And this is a natural – and I wrote about this in my first post on the topic… The fact that Ruby itself is 30 years old, mostly maintained by a committer group that’s mostly based in Japan… Ruby gems as a tool was created in America, by Americans initially, and then hosted in America, and has this separate lineage… And it’s a three-legged stool between custody of the code for Ruby Gems, and then later Bundler, and then later they merge custody and management of Ruby the language… And then rubygems.org, which is like a going concern and operational system that is running in the cloud. So from just an accesses perspective, we’re not talking about who’s got commit bit necessarily…</p>
<p>So when they say that he logged in with the root email eight hours after getting noticed that his personal access had been revoked, and then he changes the password - and that’s on September 18th; you know, you scroll down and it also says on the 28th he logged in again while he was in Tokyo, at Kaigi on Rails, another conference event. And then it’s only on September 30th, seven minutes before I blog post, that there’s any disclosure whatsoever.</p>
<p>So if he was concerned about their implication in this post, so if he was supposedly concerned about the security, had this exposure been leaked out to other maintainers, or if it was out in the wild or something, 12 days is an awful long *bleep* time to sit on that information and not disclose it.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you go back and ask “So why did we get to that point? What actually happened?”, you scroll down and the precipitating event to “Why are we getting serious about supply chain security?” was apparently - and this is an event that predates August 3rd… So presumably, when - and I haven’t met her - Shan, the new executive director at Ruby Central, doesn’t have a lot of technology experience, but does have nonprofit experience. I imagine, Mike, if it’s as dire as you’re saying in terms of lack of governance, lack of policies and procedures, my understanding is they didn’t even have terms of service and privacy policy up at the website until earlier this year… I suspect she probably came in and she’s like “We’ve got to get serious. We’ve got to run this thing better, we’ve got to introduce the standard operating procedure, make sure that we’re buttoned up from a regulatory perspective…” And then we’ve got to understand Ruby Central has been extremely budget-constrained since Rails Conf and Rails World turned into this schism - and also get the budget under control.</p>
<p>So I knew, and I’d talked to Marty about this I think maybe late last year, early this year, when he was taking on the role at Ruby Central, that they were trying to get more serious about controlling the finances, and getting the budget managed well. And so when you go through the timeline, apparently they cut the budget for secondary on-call rotation for rubygems.org, which had previously apparently been $50,000 annually, and that all of that had – that amount anyway had gone to Andre Arko’s consultancy to provide that service, even though it was rarely invoked. When he was informed that they were removing that budget, he sent an email to Marty that was kind of spit-balling an idea, it looks like, to say “Well, in lieu of getting paid in dollars, if I could be permitted to have access to the HTTP logs”, that could then be used presumably by a company to do some sort of analysis for some sort of marketable purpose… And you can debate whether there’s any sort of PII implication, or if that could be discerned from the logs… And Mike, my understanding is you probably, being the Homebrew guy, probably been approached by similar companies in the past… Regardless of the actual mechanics of that would look like, it was pretty clearly not something in the privacy policy currently, or the terms of service.</p>
<p>So that email is received on August 3rd, and then it looks like the board and leadership team… And I’m imagining now - and this is just speculation on my part - Shan as executive director, who’s still trying to get her bearings and trying to button this stuff up, probably sees that as… And this is the person who has all of the access to all these systems, and could just take it anyway, and is upset that we’re cutting the budget… That’s probably the precipitating event, and that’s how they characterize it in this email, of the thing that leads to “We’ve got to tighten up the security, and these accesses. And we don’t have an operator agreement signed for all these people who have the operational access, and we don’t have committer license agreements for all the people who are committing to this codebase, and it could cause disputes later. And so we’ve got to get those in place. So first, cut everyone’s access, get the agreements in place, and then we can start to rebuild on a firmer footing”, is my understanding of the timeline.</p>
<p>Now, that’s what I read reading this. Sure, it boils up to unauthorized access ultimately alleged against Andre, and changing the password and not disclosing it… But do I have anything there based on your – because Mike, you’ve been in a lot of the same discussions as I have, and with some of the principles… Is anything that I just characterized wrong, or is there anything you’d want to add to that?</p> </div> <div>
<p>Yeah, I don’t think there’s anything massively incorrect there. I guess for me it’s kind of an emphasis thing. Just to jump back, I guess maybe a bit of context that might be helpful for folks of where I fit into this party. So I’m a Homebrew maintainer, Homebrew being a macOS package manager, if you’ve not used it before. You can use it on Linux now as well. Fun fact. Yeah, I’ve worked on that for 16 years. I’ve essentially been probably the main person since the creator left, who’s kind of stepped into leadership stuff, and have kind of led us through various levels of financing, and fiscal hosting, and a lot of the kind of boring nonprofit-esque stuff… But notably, Homebrew does not have a dedicated nonprofit. We do not have any dedicated employees or anything like that… But we have an Open Collective, which essentially, if you’ve never used Open Collective before, is like an online banking app, but is in the spirit of open source public. So you can go and see “Two Homebrew maintainers went out for lunch about a month and a half ago in Singapore together” as our expenses; public docs say that they can do. And they had lunch, they talked about Homebrew, and they expensed that to the project, and I approved that expense.</p>
<p>So essentially, all the money coming in and out of the project, you can just go and look, without even logging in, and see what’s going on here. You can’t see people’s specific receipts with their credit card numbers for hopefully obvious reasons. But the thing I struggle with with all of this stuff is like - okay, Homebrew and Ruby Gems have been going for about the same amount of time. Ruby Gems has definitely received dramatically more money in that time, I would bet, than Homebrew. It would surprise me if it was as little as 10X more than Homebrew. But yet we, a group of volunteers scattered around the world, have been able to have transparent governance, transparent finances for five plus years. And I appreciate this is all part of a kind of tightening process and whatever, but the thing to me that all of these kind of blog posts and a lot of the discussion is missing, it’s like “Okay, who got what money, from who, and when?” That goes as far as Ruby Central employees, Ruby Central board members, Ruby Central contractors… There’s been a lot of conspiracy about how much Mike Parham has provided or removed funding, DHH has provided or removed funding, Shopify has provided or removed funding… And I don’t even want to speculate on one of those, because I don’t know what’s true or not true. But the thing I find slightly depressing about it all is it would be very easy to have all that information be at least semi-public, right? But it’s not, so it becomes an exercise… And I do think – again, with the what access Andre had to what, and when, and how, and whatever, I also think… Again, what I said earlier about the “Open source maintainers owe you nothing” thing - it’s like, at that point, is he an unpaid volunteer working on a service, and providing that to the best of his abilities?</p>
<p>I certainly think from the accounts we’re looking at, had Andre never received a cent from Ruby Central ever, I think he would read his narrative and be like “That is a hundred percent defensible, what he did, and Ruby Central are a hundred percent wrong, because they are a well-funded organization with full-time employees”, who – sorry, the bar is just much, much higher for them than it is for unpaid volunteers. But if volunteers are paid, how much – are they employees? Are they contractors? What’s their contract say or not say, or whatever? And I think that stuff is where it just all gets very murky. And that stuff is where personally, it makes me not happy that this is happening, but… I’ve been sort of saying, sometimes privately, sometimes a bit more diplomatically publicly for years, that “Hey, look, it seems like a lot of people have decided that open source sustainability is a problem we solve by just throwing more money at things, and this is the type of thing that happens when we do that.” It’s not to say that we shouldn’t, no one should have been getting paid, or we shouldn’t have had money or whatever, but once you start getting a lot of money involved in these things, things get very complicated. And you need to have significant levels of maturity and governance and transparency and experience in open source and experience in nonprofits to not f*** it up. And then maybe even if you have all those things, you still f*** it up.</p>
<p>But I think that’s where this stuff gets interesting for me, is I’m like, well, in some ways, if you were to look at Homebrew and look at Ruby Gems, you would say “Well, Homebrew is in this precarious, silly situation because they don’t have a dedicated nonprofit, they don’t have significant corporate backing”, whatever. But in a funny way, we are immune to a lot of the problems that have happened here because we have not gone in so hard on we now have significant dependencies on paying significant numbers of people their monthly wage.</p>
<p>And again, not to say we’re doing it better, they’re doing it worse, whatever, but I think there’s a lot of the open source - I sometimes call it big ‘open source’ - that is trying to push a lot of people in this direction, that we all need to just get maintainers to be paid full-time employees, and contract everything out, and whatever… And I think what gets lost is like “Well, what happens if we do that? What are the pros and cons, and to what extent that events like this happen, or at least get a lot more messy and complicated than it could have been otherwise if there was not the same degree of money involved?”</p>
<p><strong>Break</strong>: [<a href="#t=00:31:55.06">00:31:55.06</a>]</p> </div> <div> <p>So if I were to just jump to the end of this - and I’m going to jump right back where you are, Mike… But if I were to just jump in, as a guy who just types gem install every once in a while, or bundle… I know you two, I’ve interviewed DHH, I’ve interviewed Shopify people; I’ve never met Andre myself… I’m tangentially related to the Ruby community as a regular, old Ruby user. And to speak to Mike’s point from earlier, at the end of this is a rubygems.org AWS root access event. If that’s what I hear, and I find out it was days, or hours, or however long it was, and was it Andre, was it somebody else, were they malicious, were they not? Can we verify it? Like, that’s a five alarm fire, isn’t it? I mean, I install my gems, just like anybody else does - unless you’ve switched over to gem.coop - from rubygems.org… And somebody had root access to their AWS account for some amount of time, and that’s probably all that I’m hearing; maybe a little bit more about other things. And so the end result is a disaster. I mean, this has been disastrous. And now we’re in, like you said, Mike, my damage control… And so that’s just incredibly unfortunate, and a fact of history now that I think comes from, whether he said/she said, they did this/they did that, who’s to blame etc. it comes down to like money has just muddied and created no end of trouble… And it’s just really, really murky now, how you navigate money and open source. I mean, just combining those two things together… Which has been a desire and something I’ve preached for many years, is like “We need more money in open source. We need to fund these people, we need to sustain these people. We need to help these people, because they’re giving things away for free, and then other people are using them, and taking advantage, and applying pressure” etc, etc. But we’ve gotten some money now… I mean, I’m not talking about now this year, but over the last 10, 15 years - money’s come in, in certain amounts; you know, it’s not evenly distributed by any means… And it seems like – I don’t know if I can say it’s caused more trouble than it’s solved problems… Maybe it’s been better than – maybe it’s a net positive… But man, it’s sure made things even more complicated. And I’m not sure how we navigate this. I’m not sure how we navigate this going forward. Maybe the answer is complete transparency, and maybe the answer is… I don’t know, I can’t even imagine an answer that makes sense. But Mike, your stance is you can’t do it. You can’t do full-time open source maintainer as free to work on the project however they like… Like, whatever we all imagine would be the perfect life of an open source maintainer - there’s no such thing. Is that your stance?</p> </div> <div>
<p>Pretty much. I mean, Justin’s Hotfix podcast thing was like “Okay, come with a pithy quote that’s like a controversial statement.” And I think the shortest, pithiest version I got was “Open source is not a career.” And what I mean from that is that I think there’s plenty of ways to be an open source maintainer, and make a load of money. I’ve done fairly well for myself financially, I have had some doors open for me that would not have been opened otherwise were it not for my open source work, for sure. I mean, arguably, maybe bar my first job out of university, college, whatever, I think every other job my open source maintenance has influenced me getting that job… But also, every other job has – never has my paid main work being working on open source. And particularly working on Homebrew.</p>
<p>When I was at GitHub, I was at GitHub for 10 years, and I had a couple of months in which I was given permission to help migrate us urgently from bin tray to GitHub packages. And I worked on a bunch of internal code for that, I worked on a bunch of external code for that in Homebrew… But bar that, that was not my job. I did Homebrew stuff in bits of spare time and evenings and weekends, and time between meetings, whatever it may be, and that was not what I was paid for, or promoted for, or whatever. I built stuff internally. I guess not unrelatedly, I was one of the first four engineers to build GitHub Sponsors. So that was an interesting thing for me because it was being on the front line of like “Well, what happens if we put a bunch more money into open source?’</p>
<p>And I think GitHub Sponsors, again, it was telling, because if you looked – and a lot of this is all public knowledge. If you look at the people who have made the most money out of GitHub Sponsors, they are not the best open source maintainers, and they would not be offended in me stating that they are not the best open source maintainers. They are the people who have done the best job selling themselves, and selling something which other people value, through GitHub Sponsors as like a payment provider, essentially. And good on them. That’s great that they do that. But there’s a lot of people, myself included, who just slap up a GitHub Sponsors… Like, I do a lot of Homebrew stuff, and I had done for 16 years… My monthly GitHub Sponsors payment is $22 a month. That’s not me going and saying “I want to get a bunch more.” I get a bit more than that, I get $300 a month from Homebrew as our kind of maintainer stipend… But you know, the reason why I don’t get a load of money that way is because I have not dedicated time and energy into building essentially a sales process for my sponsorship pipeline. And that’s how it works. If you want to be an open source maintainer that gets funded primarily through sponsorships and money and whatever, it doesn’t look like a tip jar. It looks like you are now running essentially - you know, in the same way that other influencers might have an influencer economy or whatever… And there’s various routes of making that money, and paying those bills, and getting that open source work, but there’s not a single, easily-treaded path that is not without compromises… And it makes me very cross to see a bunch of particularly younger maintainers being told “No, this is the way. If you follow this, you will both be rich and you can work on whatever open source you ever want, whenever you want.” That’s just a lie. That’s just *bleep*.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. Well, hold on, Justin. Let me just say this… For those who are putting them through the pain of watching us on video, the fringe benefit of doing the video version of this is for the last 10 minutes you can watch Justin sit there and chomp at the bit for his opportunity. Because we’ve said so many things that I’m sure he wants to address, so much so that at one point he was literally holding his mouth shut, because he has so many things to say right now. This guy talks for three hours uninterrupted, and he hasn’t had a chance to say anything for the last 10 minutes. So Justin, just turning the floor over to you, my friend… Which of these many points would you like to address first?</p> </div> <div> <p>Gotta admit to anyone watching the video, I did get distracted at one point because my pen ran out of ink, and I had to write down –</p> </div> <div> <p>He literally left – at one point he literally left and then came back. [laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>So that was distraction number two… Distraction number one was I saw – somebody texted me that the Vision Pro with M5 was announced.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh… Well, there’s a fire alarm fire right there. [laughs]</p> </div> <div>
<p>Just to tell you my priorities… As one as one of the five remaining daily driver Vision Pro users who – I use the Mac virtual display every day, like we’ve discussed several times on the show even… So I will not be buying it, because it’s just – basically, I’m using it as a monitor… And I’d much rather just talk about that now, but… To try to honor what Mike just said, when we say “Open source is not a career”, it’s kind of – running a consultancy, so helping co-found, help start, whatever, a consulting company… Speaking at conferences, doing some amount of open source, none of – I was very fortunate in life in that none of my open source was super-successful. It seems like a huge pain in the ass when that happens, for the most part, in terms of the burden of issues, and pull requests, and yadda-yadda. But I was visible enough that people would come up to me, younger folks, less experienced people, people trying to succeed in this industry, and they would – whether it was about speaking, or whether it was about blogging, or whether it was about doing open source, a lot of the activities that people saw me do… They’d look at that and they’d confuse the means with the ends. So they’d say “Hey, how do I break into open source?” And so I’m like “That’s a real weird goal”, because I do open source because I’m trying to get something done that makes me money, like working for a client… And the first real project I did was a Java client, and we had a whole lot of JavaScript and no way to run tests against it in CI. And I was like “That won’t do.” And so I started unit testing our JavaScript with Jasmine, locally. Well, how do you get that running in CI? I had to figure out a – this was back in 2010, or whatever… Run a sudo HTML and JavaScript fake environment in a Java runtime, and then make a Maven plugin that we could incorporate into the build. And I did that on my own time, on a weekend, or late at night or something. And then I just plugged it into the client code the next day… And like “Here you go, a gift, free of charge, because it makes my life easier at work, and we’re going to ship your code better.” Almost every one of my open source projects was that. It was “I have a job, it pays me money, and that job would be massively improved in terms of the outcomes or my life at that job by writing some open source… So I’m going to solve my problem, and I’m going to make it open because that’s easier than getting approval to make it closed internally.” If I have some asinine idea for how I can make things a little bit better, forgiveness is way better than permission. Maybe it won’t work. Why would I fight for budget and time to go on some escapade to like “Hey, I can vaguely improve things in a way that you don’t understand”, when I could just go on my own GitHub, publish something publicly, and then go and consume that at work? And if it turns out that it’s useful, then work is happy to let me spend some hours building it, because then I’ve got a virtuous – I’ve got at least one person depending on it, and that’s the person paying me. So then I can keep working on it a little bit and make it a little bit better, respond to issues and feedback… And that’s typically how I’ve done open source. That’s one way to do it, and in a very, very small sense, that at least has incentives aligned, where it’s like “I make this thing better because it’s built for a purpose, for somebody who needs it.” And that’s not breaking into open source. That’s not saying “Okay, so what I want to do is I want to work on this open source project…” And I’ve seen this play out lots of times, whether it’s through the sponsorship deal, or Ruby Together and later Ruby Central did this - they actually paid hourly for people to work on Bundler and Ruby Gems codebases… And when you’re talking about a high $150 an hour or whatever it is hourly rate to work on an open source tool, then a lot of questions arise. Like, what do you work on? Who chooses the priority of that work? If you’re talking about 150 bucks an hour, or zero dollars an hour, with most of the people contributing making zero dollars an hour, suddenly there’s a perverse incentive there to be like “Alright, well –” What if there’s nothing else to do? What if Bundler is a solved problem, and basically does everything it needs? Now you’ve got a perverse incentive to create makework, to justify more hours, to get more money.</p>
<p>And if the goal at the end is “I want to make a replacement-level tech career doing open source activities”, I think the places that leads you in terms of the amount of complexity and machinations in terms of how that funding gets to you, and the amount of singing and dancing, and glad handing and arm twisting that you need to do to extract those dollars from people who might not necessarily see a direct value or benefit or ROI for giving you that money - it leads to places like this that are as God damn confusing as the situation that we’re in now.</p>
<p>That’s I guess maybe a twisted knife version of the picture that Mike’s painting - this is just all about, at the end of the day - incentives were not aligned because people wanted to get paid. And this is where this leads you. And yes, it’s really sad that a lot of people do open source for free, but a lot of people have hobbies for free, and if they choose to keep doing them, it’s kind of their task. I don’t know what to tell you.</p> </div> <div>
<p>And that’s the thing - for me, genuinely, open source for free as a hobby is a beautiful thing. And we should think very carefully before we decide to kill that, by either paying everyone, which won’t happen, or by making people who aren’t being paid feel like they are being exploited. Again, it really *bleep* me off no end when you have people often with minimal involvement in open source themselves going around telling open source maintainers “Big companies are exploiting your labor.” And I said “Well, if only there was a way to get a big company to pay me to write software for them. Oh wait, we have lots of that.” But the reason why lots of people, including me, enjoy open source software and have continued to work on it for a very long time is it’s like, I don’t have an engineering manager, or product manager, or technical project manager being like “Please sign your TPS reports. When will this be done? Is this a yellow T-shirt or a green T-shirt size project?” Being able to just opt out from all of that bureaucracy is – you know, that bureaucracy is important and necessary sometimes, but it’s also nice to not have to do that. And when you don’t have to do that, you can operate in a different way and work in a different way, and that’s fine.</p>
<p>And again, we go back to the “Open source maintainers owe you nothing”, where it’s like if someone doesn’t it – I mean, there’s legitimately issues on Homebrew that people file, and it’s like “This is a legit issue, but you’re being a ****head about it, so I’m just going to close your issue.” And when they’re like “Oh, [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:48:17.12">00:48:17.12</a>] then I’m like “Well, **** you. Tough luck. I can do what I want.” But if I’m a paid employee, and if that person is a paid customer, in some companies you can do that, sure… But that’s not terribly advisable. And I think this goes back to what we were saying, about perverse incentives, and who gets paid and who doesn’t get paid. It’s like, well, open source maintainers owe you nothing, sure. People who are being paid to do something owe someone something.</p> </div> <div> <p>Right.</p> </div> <div>
<p>And again, in Homebrew’s case, we specifically do… We have all open tooling, and open documentation, and blah, blah, blah, and we pay maintainers that hit a certain threshold $300 a month. We call it a stipend. There are people for whom, I’m sure, the average American child delivering newspapers, if that’s still a thing that happens, is making significantly better hourly wage than some of these open source maintainers are… But it’s fine, because that’s just a token amount for appreciation for them. And even then, we’ve not done anything publicly or whatever, because we try and in Homebrew do a reasonable job at keeping some of our drama behind closed doors… But even in that case, for a very small amount of money, we had a person with a very well-paid day job, who was doing the wrong thing, essentially because they wanted to hit a threshold to get an extra three hundred bucks a month, right? And that made us reconsider how we do this stuff.</p>
<p>But to go way back to something that Justin said right at the beginning, about he did open source to solve his own problems. Back when I got involved first with open source, in the heady days of the Linux desktop back in 2007, when I did my first Google Summer of Code, and met a lot of these KDE people, and I was a Linux guy… The thing that people used to say all the time then, that I never hear anyone saying now, is “Open source is about scratching your own itch.”</p>
<p>And what people meant by that back then was open source is primarily about solving your own problems, and then releasing it in a way that other people can benefit from you doing that. And that’s why I did it, and it’s why I do it. Because when I work on Homebrew, and I make Homebrew a little bit better, it’s usually because something in Homebrew annoys me, and I use Homebrew, therefore I make it better. And that’s completely the opposite from the attitude Justin was saying, of “How do I break it into open source?” Whenever anyone’s asked me that, I’m like “Well, find a tool that you use, find something annoying with that tool, and then go fix it.” And they’re like “Oh, but I don’t know JavaScript yet” or “I don’t know this” or “I haven’t contributed to that codebase” or “I can’t find a mentor” or whatever… And again, as we’re being a bit more spicy on this podcast, it’s like “Well, congratulations. You lose. You’re never going to be a successful open source maintainer.” I’ve never seen someone who’s been a good open source maintainer who has been taught into being so, or encouraged, or given enough money that they kind of finally get over a line, or whatever. That helps people contribute, and it’s great, and we shouldn’t discount that as being a thing that we do for some people sometimes… But most of the time, most of those people, it’s intrinsic, internal motivation that gets them to do this stuff. And that doesn’t come from “I want money. I want clout. I want my resume or CV to look better.” It has to come from “I just want to do it because it’s interesting and fun for me.”</p> </div> <div> <p>I think this goes beyond open source software, because the pattern is very generic. It’s like “I love doing X, so I do it for fun. I would love to do X more. If I could only make money doing X, I could do it more.” And then X becomes not fun anymore, if that’s successful. Basically, that’s the pattern. So it’s not just software, but creation of all kinds. Anytimes you can parlay your hobby or your passion into a job, your passion is now your job. And your job’s a job, and jobs aren’t fun. Even if it’s the exact same –</p> </div> <div> <p>You can add to that, Jerod, because then you can take all your friends you have good relationships with - and I tried this one, it was a lot of fun - and then you hire your friends, and then your friends aren’t your friends either.</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s right. [laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>And you live in a basement in Ohio and you’re like “Oh my God, what have I done with my life?”</p> </div> <div>
<p>I’ve destroyed my hobby and my friends. But I got money in exchange. We’re just trading it all in for money. Yeah, that’s the unsolvable problem I think right there. And for years and years we’ve been looking for more paths to funding, more ways, because there’s so many different kinds of open source… And there’s ones that have an easy time making money, because they are right there staring you in the face; they’re like end user applications. And then there’s the dependency of the dependency of the dependency, who only has a GitHub account and is not on any social networks, and is never going to make a dollar on their GitHub Sponsors, because nobody even knows that they’re transitively installing… Xz, for instance; just naming one that was exploited.</p>
<p>And so maybe – I just thought there was different models, and we need to just explore all these different models. And I remember, going back years, to Nadia Eghbal’s Lemonade Stand repo, which she published back when she was doing her open source funding writing… And she documented, “Here’s all the different ways: bounty programs, open core”, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it’s like “Pick one that helps you.”</p>
<p>And we’ve explored on this show, over the course of a decade now, different people doing these different models, and with more or less success. And at the end of the day, the happiest people that we’ve ever talked to about their work are the ones that are like “Yeah, I do this for fun. I’m not going to monetize.” And it’s like, that ends up being the healthiest relationship to your open source code, is “I do this for fun. I’m not trying to monetize it.” Because every one of these models - we can go through them all and they all produce at some point the perverse incentives that have happened in the Ruby community.</p> </div> <div> <p>To me it’s not even monetization versus not. It’s like direct monetization versus indirect monetization.</p> </div> <div> <p>Sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>And I can’t remember what it was, I’m sure it’s some much wisened, old philosopher or whatever who said this - and I’m going to paraphrase it and butcher it horribly… But basically, the idea of like the best things in life are achieved indirectly. So let’s not be overly crude. I’ll try and be relatively diplomatic, but basically, for example if your goal is romantic companionship, there’s ways of getting elements of that very quickly in exchange for money. But most people would say that actually, that’s probably not the most fulfilling long-term option. And the most fulfilling long-term option - you know, I’ve been with my now wife for 23 years. We have a perfect marriage and relationship. I’m very, very happy. That takes a lot of time and effort. And again, I have almost a pending blog post brewing about just being patient. It feels like it pays a lot of dividends on this stuff. I was at GitHub for 10 years, I’ve been with my wife for 23, my best friend, who comes around to my house, we’re currently watching Alien Earth. It’s very good. We’ve been friends for –</p> </div> <div> <p>Right now you’re watching it?</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, I mean, not right now, because I’m on a podcast…</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] Okay. Well, you said you have your best friend coming over and you’re currently watching Alien Earth. I’m like “Dang, this guy can multitask.”</p> </div> <div>
<p>I’ll do my best to multitask. But yeah, I mean, we’ve been friends for 30 years. And Homebrew for 16 years. Most of the good things in my life are things that I have done for more than 10 years. And there has been ups and downs in those times. And there’s been times where if you were to look at some tiny microcosm of like the first months or weeks or whatever, or a particular segment, you’d be like “Oh, well, this isn’t worth it. I’m going to bail. I’m going to quit. I’m going to move on.” But again, all of these things are things that I’ve got, and have made me very, very happy, and I’m delighted with, not because I wanted to make as much money as possible, or have as much whatever as possible - human relationship, interaction, whatever - but just because I enjoy the process going along, and I still enjoy the process going along… And that tends to get you to a very good place. If every day you enjoy your life, and you keep doing that and keep enjoying your life, and at the same time stuff like money, you’re like “Okay, well, I need to pay the bills. I need to make sure that I make enough money to provide for me and my family” and whatever, but you’re also really excited about what you’re doing, then that tends to work pretty well. And if you go and chase maximum financial return for anything, on the short term basis, like - okay, you might make a bunch of money, often you don’t, but you’re probably going to be miserable in the longer term. And you’re going to be like “Why am I doing this?” and “I need to quit” and whatever.</p>
<p>I mean, almost that’s the definition of sustainability. When we’re not talking about open source sustainability, when we talk about anything being sustainable, the idea is “How do we get people to be able to do this for a long period of time, and without being a cheeseball?” Open source sustainability comes from within. The reason why I have been able to do it for a long time and not burn out - I mean, literally, in that 16-year window, I don’t think I’ve gone a month without working on Homebrew. I’ve maybe not even gone three weeks without working on Homebrew. And the reason why is because I enjoyed it then, and I enjoy it now. And I know what I’m willing to do and what I’m not willing to do. And for me, it has to stay enjoyable, or I’m going to quit. And I built a group of maintainers where I’m very protective of them, because I know that’s the same for them. And to me, just almost looking at yourself in the mirror and being like “Am I enjoying this? Is this good?” And if it is - great, do more of that. And if it’s not, then just stop. And that terrifies a lot of people, because it’s like “Oh, well, open source will collapse, and we have all these maintainers who walk away.” And I say, “Well, actually, no, because someone will step up and do what needs to be done if what you’re doing is really important.” And that’s maybe the hardest part of it all. It’s like, maybe that open source project you’ve spent a huge amount of time and energy into, maybe it’s not that important. Maybe it is replaceable, and maybe your role is replaceable. And that sucks, to look in the mirror and think that… But maybe that’s true, and maybe you need to do that.</p> </div> <div>
<p>Look… If you’re watching this video, you’re going to be probably noticing that we’re three white men… The collective noun for white middle aged men is podcast. I get it. But it’s true. And a piece of context about that 2015 to 2021 era, especially in the U.S. and politically, is like, this conversation about just being tutted by older guys who are already successful in their careers - “Oh, just do it as a hobby. Just do open source in your free time”, or something. When that comes into contact with this motivation, that open source is an ends, not a means, and it’s a way to get – because highly visible people are doing it, people rightly assume, for whatever reason you’re doing it, “If I were to do that at the same stage or at the same level of impact or in the same high profile project, then I too would be highly visible, and therefore I could parlay that into more marketability as an employee. I’d be hired in at the staff level, or at the principal level, or I’d have better employment prospects.”</p>
<p>Even though I started doing open source to scratch my own itch, to Mike’s point, and that’s still the reason I’m ever motivated to do it, it created a virtuous cycle, not just for my employer to be able to benefit from my hobby work, but for me to be able to parlay those projects into new relationships and credibility, because your GitHub profile kind of redounds to at least some kind of proof that this guy can write working software, and this is what it solves.</p>
<p>And mixed in with all of that is like “Well, what if you don’t have the free time, or if you’ve got family responsibilities, or there’s some other systemic reason why you aren’t able to just work for free and make this time possible?” It’s creating an avenue for more privileged people who do have that luxury of time to pursue that hobby. And then even though it’s just a hobby, it’s not like – I definitely made more money out of my programming habit than out of my Japanese language acquisition habit in terms of a hobby. So that’s not lost on me here, it’s just kind of a fact of life… And I don’t know how to solve it, because when you try to solve this through the lens of… Like, when the conclusion - and I heard this a lot in the late 2010, was “And that’s why we have to pay people to write open source.” I was like “The number of circles and loops necessary to kind of connect these dots together in a way that’s actually going to get the outcome that you want is so convoluted that this is probably just going to make things worse.”</p>
<p>I can’t say we’re in a much better place in all of these experiments where people are – and again, to Mike’s point, where people are being directly compensated for their open source efforts, especially in an ad hoc or a semi-directed pseudo employment manner, through contracting and through kind of an amalgamation of funds and sponsors and donors. I don’t know what to do – I just want to put it out there so we don’t get emails about privilege, I’ll be honest. That’s why I said those things.</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs]</p> </div> </div> </section> </div></div>

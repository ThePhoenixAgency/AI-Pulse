Situated in a historic building on the vibrant corner of Sainte-Catherine Street West and Rue de la Montagne, Apple Sainte-Catherine more than doubles the size of the store’s previous location, expanding Apple’s presence in downtown Montreal. The store showcases Apple’s innovations in products and services while inviting customers to experience best-in-class support from highly knowledgeable Apple Specialists in a beautifully redesigned space. “For nearly 20 years, we’ve been proud to be part of the downtown Montreal community, whose spirit of creativity and innovation continues to inspire us,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail and People. “We’re incredibly excited to build on this long-standing relationship and create a destination where our customers can experience the very best of Apple, from our innovative products to the expert care and support of our amazing team.” Apple Sainte-Catherine has been thoughtfully designed to create an inviting space where everyone is welcome. The store offers varied tables and seating heights, as well as access routes that give wheelchair users more space to navigate. The façade of the store blends historic Saint-Marc stone from Quebec with local granite, while local copper artisans extensively restored the cornice that tops the building. Toward the back of the store, the dedicated Apple Pickup area makes it easy for customers to make a purchase on the Apple Store online and collect their products in store at a time that’s convenient for them, while the Genius Bar provides support from trusted Apple Specialists. Customers can also receive support that is only available at Apple retail, including personalized shopping sessions with Apple Specialists, flexible monthly financing options, competitive trade-in values, and expert guidance. With free Today at Apple sessions, participants can learn how to frame a shot, edit a video, or get started with Apple Intelligence on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Today at Apple also offers sessions that teach the basics of using assistive technologies and features such as VoiceOver on iPhone and iPad. At Apple Sainte-Catherine, the nearly 200-person team of highly trained Specialists collectively speak dozens of languages. They’re ready to welcome customers and share new tips to help them make the most of their devices. To celebrate the opening, Montreal-based illustrator and designer Catherine Potvin will be leading live art demos on iPad on Friday, January 16, and Saturday, January 17. At select times on both days, customers can receive an illustration from Potvin drawn on their Apple retail bags. Apple has operated in Canada for more than 40 years and currently has 28 retail stores across the country, including five in Quebec. Customers are encouraged to take a creative journey across Quebec by exploring film, TV, music, books, podcasts, and apps created locally; listen to a curated Apple Music Sainte-Catherine playlist; and sign up for Today at Apple sessions.

    <div><div>   <p>By Arsheeya Bajwa</p>   <p>Feb 12 (Reuters) - Applied Materials (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMAT">AMAT</a>) forecast second-quarter revenue and profit above market estimates on Thursday, betting on a boom in demand for AI processors ‌and a worldwide memory shortage to help drive sales of its chipmaking equipment.</p>   <p>The ‌rapid build-out of <a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/">artificial intelligence</a> infrastructure — a major driver for Applied — has absorbed much of the world's memory chip ​supply, boosting production capacity, and further helping the company's sales.</p>   <p>The company's shares rose 12% during premarket trading on Friday. Shares of peers Lam Research (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LRCX">LRCX</a>) and KLA (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KLAC">KLAC</a>) rose nearly 3% each before the bell, as Applied's upbeat outlook lifted sentiment.</p>      <p>Applied Materials expects second-quarter sales of about $7.65 billion, plus or minus $500 million, ‌compared with estimates of $7.01 billion, ⁠according to data compiled by LSEG.</p>   <p>The results were "fueled by the acceleration of industry investments in AI computing," CEO Gary Dickerson said in a statement.</p>          <p>"The ⁠need for higher performance and more energy-efficient chips is driving high growth rates for leading-edge logic, high-bandwidth memory and advanced packaging."</p>   <p>The largest U.S. semiconductor equipment maker forecast second-quarter adjusted profit of about $2.64 ​per share, ​plus or minus 20 cents, compared with estimates ​of $2.28.</p>   <p>"Memory and logic-foundry capex growth are ‌two sides of the same coin. They are both growing significantly – with memory a greater growth driver near-term," said Timm Schulze-Melander, a Rothschild &amp; Co. Redburn analyst.</p>   <p>Logic generally refers to a type of chip that is capable of serving as the brains of a system, such as graphics processors and central processing units.</p>      <p>High-bandwidth memory (HBM), made by stacking layers of dynamic random ‌access memory (DRAM) on top of each other, refers ​to a type of advanced memory chip used alongside ​pricey AI processors such as those sold ​by <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/">Nvidia</a>.</p>   <p>Applied expects DRAM to be its fastest growing segment in ‌2026, coupled with 3D chiplet stacking — a ​technique used extensively in ​producing AI processors — Dickerson said during a post-earnings call.</p>   <p>The company reported first-quarter revenue of $7.01 billion, beating estimates of $6.87 billion.</p>   <p>Revenue for the quarter ended January 25 included record DRAM ​sales on a year-on-year basis, ‌finance chief Brice Hill said during the call.</p>   <section><p><img alt="Yahoo Finance Morning Brief" src="https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/finance/newsletter/yfmb_v2.png" /></p>    </section>   <p>The company reported first-quarter profit of $2.38 ​per share, excluding items. Analysts had expected $2.20 per share.</p>   <p>(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in ​Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona and Sriraj Kalluvila)</p>   </div></div>

    <div><div>   <p>By Kane Wu and Andrew Silver</p>   <p>HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Global drugmakers are stepping up their search for China‑developed experimental medicines as they cut costs ahead of patent expirations, with industry analysts predicting licensing deals will surge to a fresh record this year.</p>   <p>The value of such deals signed by ‌companies in the greater China region - which includes Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan - rose nearly tenfold last year from 2021 to an unprecedented $137.7 billion, according ‌to data provider Pharmcube.</p>            <p>Mainland China has overwhelmingly been at the centre of that search, with global drugmakers including Novartis, Merck and GSK inking major agreements last year.</p>   <p>"The total value of these licensing-out deals is on track ​to double again over the next 18-24 months," said Tom Barsha, head of Asia Pacific M&amp;A at BofA Securities, who has advised on such deals.</p>   <p>"There is strong focus among global pharmaceutical companies to identify the next generation of innovative drugs pipeline in China, with various transaction structures being contemplated."</p>   <p>Tony Ren, head of Asia healthcare research at Macquarie Capital, predicts a more cautious 40%-50% growth this year and expects assets from a class of drugs considered a backbone for oncological treatments to draw interest from global drugmakers.</p>      <p>A licensing agreement grants a company the rights ‌to develop, manufacture or commercialize another company's pharmaceutical products or technologies ⁠in exchange for an upfront fee or future target-based - or "milestone" - payments, thus mitigating development risks.</p>   <p>SURGING DEAL SIZES</p>   <p>Underscoring the increased pace of foreign interest, the average deal size this year has already reached $1.3 billion as of this week, up 76% from 2025 levels and about six ⁠times the average in 2021, Pharmcube data showed.</p>   <p>The jump is largely thanks to AstraZeneca's experimental weight-loss drug deal worth up to $18.5 billion with CSPC Pharmaceutical Group and AbbVie's up to $5.6 billion licensing deal with RemeGen for experimental tumor treatment last month.</p>      <p>The total deal value is typically a combination of upfront fees, milestone payments and royalties.</p>   <p>So far in 2026, 38 out-licensing deals have already been announced. ​Last ​year, a total of 186 such deals were signed.</p>   <p>This week, U.S.-based Madrigal Pharmaceuticals announced a licensing deal ​with Suzhou Ribo Life Science for experimental liver-disease programmes.</p>    <p>The Chinese biotech ‌will get an upfront payment of $60 million, with total payments across the programmes potentially reaching up to $4.4 billion if certain milestones are met.</p>  </div></div>

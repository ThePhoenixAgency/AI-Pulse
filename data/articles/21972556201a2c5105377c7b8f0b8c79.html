<p>Dutch telecommunications provider Odido is warning that it suffered a cyberattack that reportedly exposed the personal data of 6.2 million customers.</p>

<p>Odido is one of the largest mobile and telecommunications providers in the Netherlands, offering mobile, broadband, and television services to millions of customers nationwide.&nbsp;The company was formed in 2023 through the rebranding of T-Mobile Netherlands and Tele2 Netherlands.</p>

<p>The company says they detected the incident on the weekend of February 7&nbsp;and launched an investigation with internal and external cybersecurity experts.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>Odido says that the attackers breached their customer contact system, allowing them to download the personal data of many of its&nbsp;customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Odido has been hit by a cyberattack, which compromised customer data," <a href="https://www.odido.nl/veiligheid" target="_blank">warns the company</a>.</p>

<p>"This involved personal data from a customer contact system used by Odido. No passwords, call logs, or billing information were affected."</p>

<p>Odido told <a href="https://www.nu.nl/binnenland/6385809/gegevens-miljoenen-odido-klanten-gelekt-na-grote-cyberaanval.html" target="_blank">Nu.nl</a> that the breach affects 6.2 million customers, and that the threat actors contacted the company to say they stole millions of records.</p>

<p>After learning of the breach, Odido says they immediately blocked the unauthorized access to its customer contact information and reported the breach to the Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens).</p>

<p>Odido says the exposed information varies per customer but&nbsp;may include:</p>

<ul><li>Full name</li>
	<li>Address and place of residence</li>
	<li>Mobile number</li>
	<li>Customer number</li>
	<li>Email address</li>
	<li>IBAN (account number)</li>
	<li>Date of birth</li>
	<li>Identification data (passport or driver's license number and validity)</li>
</ul><p>However, the company emphasized that passwords, call records, location data, invoice details, and scans of identification documents were not affected.</p>

<p>The company is now emailing all impacted customers who should receive the notification within 48 hours.</p>

<p>Odido says it has now blocked the unauthorized access, strengthened security controls, increased monitoring for suspicious activity, and engaged external cybersecurity experts to assist with incident response and mitigation.</p>

<p>At this time, BleepingComputer has found no evidence that the data has been publicly leaked or who is behind the attack.</p>

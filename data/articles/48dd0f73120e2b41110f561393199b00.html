"However, we've always been disciplined."</p></div><div><p>"This transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price," the Netflix executives added.</p></div><div><p>The announcement came just hours after Sarandos had visited the White House on Thursday.</p></div><div><p>It caps off a dramatic months-long saga that - if approved by regulators - is likely to reshape Hollywood.</p></div><div><p>But California Attorney General Rob Bonta said later on Thursday that the potential merger "is not a done deal".</p></div><div><p>Paramount would also need approval from the US Department of Justice as well as European regulators.</p></div><div><p>A deal between Paramount and Warner Bros could hold serious ramifications for the future of one of the US's biggest news brands - CNN. Warner Bros is the network's parent company.</p></div><div><p>Paramount, which is looking to transform itself into a Hollywood heavyweight, is backed by tech billionaire Larry Ellison and led by his son David.</p></div><div><p>The funding of Paramount's offer has drawn scrutiny, in part over the close ties between US President Donald Trump and Larry Ellison, a major Republican donor.</p></div><div><p>Trump has frequently attacked the news network over its reporting of his policies. He said in December that he believed CNN should be sold as part of any Warner Bros deal. He called the people running CNN "corrupt or incompetent" and said they should not be entrusted to run the network.</p></div><div><p>CNN head Mark Thompson sent an email to employees as news spread of the all-but-assured Paramount deal, telling workers to not "jump to conclusions about the future until we know more", US media reported. </p></div><div><p>The BBC has contacted CNN for comment.</p></div><div><p>Paramount's initial hostile bid was also supported by Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner through his investment firm, raising concerns about the president's influence over the deal.</p></div><div><p>Kushner's firm, Affinity Partners, backed away in December amid scrutiny over the deal.</p></div><div><p>Paramount's 2025 merger with Skydance also led to scrutiny amid negotiations with the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission, which had to sign off on the deal.</p></div><div><p>Among the concessions made was <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w4n8778q2o">Paramount's $16m settlement on behalf of CBS News</a>. Trump had sued the network over a "60 Minutes" interview with former vice president Kamala Harris, claiming that the network had engaged in election interference in the way the program was edited.</p></div><div><p>The two studio's merger later resulted in leadership shakeups and layoffs at CBS News.</p></div><div><p>On Thursday, chief executive David Ellison welcomed the Warner Bros board's decision in favour of Paramount's sweetened offer. The proposal, he said in a statement, offers Warner Bros shareholders "superior value, certainty and speed to closing".</p></div><div><p>If Paramount's deal is approved by regulators, the company would fold Warner Bros' HBO Max streaming customers into its portfolio. It would also take ownership of CNN, the Food Network and a range of sports offerings.</p></div><div><p>Paramount's traditional networks already include brands such as Nickelodeon, CBS and Comedy Central.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6ce3/live/b117fc30-1395-11f1-bda0-212ac247e1e1.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaking at a panel"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Paramount Skydance boss David Ellison</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Many in Hollywood have viewed the bidding war between Netflix and Paramount as a battle with no good winner.</p></div><div><p>Critics of a deal with Netflix voiced concern that the storied movie studio would be lost to the Silicon Valley streaming titan, paving the way for the depletion of cinema. But a merger with Paramount, which has touted itself among the last standing movie studios in Hollywood, also left critics unnerved over the company's perceived political connections to the Trump administration - a concern that has also riled the media landscape over the future of CNN. </p></div><div><p>Across the board, the selling of Warner Bros will have massive ramification across Tinsel town, with all but assured cuts to staff in a city that has been marred by continued production cuts.</p></div><div><p>In December, Warner Bros said it had agreed to sell its film and streaming divisions, including HBO, to Netflix in a deal worth $27.75 per share or roughly $82bn (£61bn), including debt.</p></div><div><p>Warner Bros said it would spin-off the remainder of its business, including traditional television networks and the news channel CNN, as an independent company.</p></div><div><p>But in a last-ditch push, Paramount this week agreed to pay more for a Warner Bros takeover. The company offered $31 per share in cash, up from $30 per share to take over the entire company.</p></div><div><p>It also agreed to pay $7bn should the deal fall through and cover the $2.8bn fee Warner Bros had agreed to pay Netflix in the event of a break-up of the merger plan.</p></div><div><p><i>Additional reporting by Osmond Chia</i></p></div></article></div></div>

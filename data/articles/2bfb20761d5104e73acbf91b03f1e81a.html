In second place was the Jamaat-e-Islami party, which won 77 seats, positioning it as the main opposition party. Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from participating.</p><p>Rahman <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/14/bnp-wins-bangladesh-election-tarique-rahman-set-to-be-prime-minister">appealed for unity</a> in the wake of his party’s victory, saying “our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united”.</p><p>In addition to electing their new representatives, Bangladeshi voters also endorsed sweeping democratic reforms in a national referendum.</p><p>The lengthy document of reforms, known as the “July Charter” after the month when the uprising that toppled Hasina began, proposes term limits for prime ministers, the creation of an upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence. It enshrines a key pillar of Yunus’s post-uprising transition agenda.</p><p>The referendum noted that approval would make the charter “binding on the parties that win” the election, obliging them to endorse it.</p><p>“Sweeping away the ruins, we rebuilt institutions and set the course for reforms,” said Yunus, praising the reforms.</p><p>However, several parties raised questions before the vote, and the reforms will still require ratification by the new parliament.</p><p>“The challenge now is to ensure good governance, law and order, and public safety, and to establish a rights-based state, which was at the heart of the aspirations of the 2024 mass uprising,” Rezaul Karim Rony, a Dhaka-based political analyst, told Al Jazeera.</p></div></div>

Our thoughts are with Rondale's family and friends during this devastating time."</p></div><div><p>Moore spent three years with the Arizona Cardinals after being drawn as a second-round pick in the 2021 draft.</p><p>He joined the Atlanta Falcons in 2024 but a knee injury saw him miss the entire campaign, before joining the Vikings in 2025.</p><p>"While Rondale had been a member of the Vikings for a short time, he was someone we came to know well and care about deeply," said Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell.</p><p>"He was a humble, soft-spoken and respectful young man who was proud of his Indiana roots. </p><p>"We are all heartbroken by the fact he won't continue to live out his NFL dream and we won't all have a chance to watch him flourish."</p><p>The NFL said they were "deeply saddened" by the "tragic passing" of Moore. </p><p>After making his NFL debut in 2021, Moore went on to make 135 catches for 1,201 yards for the Cardinals over three seasons in Arizona.</p><p>"We are devastated and heartbroken by today's news," the Cardinals said in a statement. </p><p>"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family, friends, team-mates, and everyone who loved him and had the privilege of knowing such a special person."</p><p>Former Cardinals team-mate JJ Watt said: "Can't even begin to fathom or process this. There's just no way. Way too soon. Way too special. So much left to give. Rest in peace Rondale."</p><p>The NFL Players Association, which is a union for players' welfare, said: "In moments like this, we are reminded of how much our players carry, on and off the field.</p><p>"To our members: please know that support is always within reach.

<p> as the years before: fireworks across the globe. People greeted the new year with new resolutions and new goals. Someone, somewhere, surely said: “2026 is going to be THE year.”</p>



<p>Then January happened.</p>



<p>As the weeks went on, the end of the month came closer. And for people in ML research, late January has a very specific flavor: it’s deadline season. The ICML rolls around, and suddenly the calm end-of-year downtime — when offices were empty and inboxes were quiet for long times— turns into 110% energy. </p>



<p>That’s a stark contrast: from slow days to sprint days. But perhaps that contrast is not a flaw, but part of the rhythm? After a proper recharge, people can come back stronger, full of energy.</p>



<p>Looking back (delayed) on January, I found three themes that belong together: deadlines, downtimes, and flow times. The first two are obvious. The third falls in between the two and consists of long stretches of focused work; where something is just challenging enough to require concentration, and you can stay with it for hours.</p>



<h2>Deadlines</h2>



<p>Deadlines come in all sizes, and in all areas.</p>



<p>In private life, it might be the deadline for an insurance claim, an interest payment, or some official letter that you really should not ignore for too long. In work life, it’s project milestones, feature releases, and — for researchers — paper deadlines.</p>



<p><em>If the last minute didn’t exist, nothing would ever get finished.</em></p>



<p>We all know the downsides of stress, and yes, chronic stress is bad. But, over the years, I’ve come to appreciate that a <em>pointed dose</em> of stress, over limited time, can be good. For me, those deadlines are essentially a mechanism to create that dose. Suddenly, everything else pales in comparison because this one thing must be done — now.</p>



<p>That’s also why, rather strangely, I often enjoy getting closer to deadlines. Not because I like the panic. But because I like the clarity. A deadline creates priorities in a way that normal days don’t.</p>



<p>In daily ML work, things often feel more continuous: experiments run on the cluster, pipelines are adjusted, bugs are fixed. No big dramatic finish line, only minor mishaps. But once in a while, the pipeline has to ship. A feature needs to be added. An evaluation needs to be stable. And then, briefly, the whole team locks in. Less chatter, fewer side quests, more alignment. Deadlines can be stressful — but they give you focus.</p>



<p>Turns out, what if you don’t have deadlines in your life? No worries, create small ones. A weekly internal deadline for a prototype. A Friday cutoff for an ablation set. Something that forces clarity without burning you out.</p>



<h2>Downtimes</h2>



<p>After the deadline is before the deadline.</p>



<p>Yes yes. But, first, a downtime.</p>



<p>After a stressful phase, it is <strong>genuinely good to do nothing for a while.</strong> Or at least, to do less, or to do things slower. After a stressful year, it’s good to take an extended break and recharge the batteries.</p>



<p>If you track time at work and collect overtime, this is the perfect moment to use it. If you don’t track time, taking one paid day off — or two — to balance the intensity is still a good idea. Or, leave work earlier: it’s not laziness. It’s making sure you can do the things you enjoy for long time.</p>



<p>I used to underestimate downtime because it can feel unproductive, <em>you don’t do anything.</em> But that’s the point: downtime is productive, but it uses a different currency, called <em>future readiness.</em> It restores your ability to focus later. It prevents the slow decline where you keep working but your attention gets worse, your patience gets shorter, and you start needing more effort for the same output.</p>



<p>That’s why I recommend planning downtime like worktime. Put it on the calendar. Especially after intense stretches. If you “wait until you feel like it,” you might never feel like you’ve earned it.</p>



<h2>Flow times</h2>



<p>These three ideas are connected.</p>



<p>After the deadline, you have earned your downtime. Then, once recovered, you return with new energy for new projects — which helps you reach the next deadline. And so on.</p>



<p>But the interesting part is what happens <em>between</em> downtime and deadline: the flow time.</p>



<p>Flow time is when you’re working on something that is just challenging enough to require real concentration, and then you stay with it long enough that your mind <span>fully</span> enters the task.</p>



<p>I found that’s where good work happens.</p>



<p>Flow time comes in different shapes: it might be implementing a feature (adding attention mechanisms, handling missing values properly, getting evaluation right, integrating some “agentic” principle carefully, rather than slapping it on). Or it might be moving a whole project forward, like the steady march toward a submission deadline. Either way, flow requires one thing that modern work life often attacks: uninterrupted time.</p>



<p>The concept of flow was coined by <strong>Mihály Csíkszentmihályi</strong>, and it describes exactly that sweet spot: high engagement, high focus, low self-consciousness. You don’t “try” to concentrate; concentration happens as a side effect of being in the right zone.</p>



<p>And when you’re <em>in the flow</em>, things get done.</p>



<p>Thus, protect flow time explicitly. Make a regularly recurring blocker for a few hours. Turn of messaging notifications (or close applications entirely). Make one task the only task. Even one or two flow blocks per week can change how much you get done — and how fulfilling the work feels.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>January reminded me that a good work rhythm is not about always pushing hard.</p>



<p>It’s about working in cycles</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Deadlines</strong> for priorities and create focus.</li>



<li><strong>Downtimes</strong> to restore energy and prevent slow burnout.</li>



<li><strong>Flow times</strong> to make meaningful work.</li>
</ul>



<p>For the rest of the year, I’m trying to treat this as a deliberate loop: earn the downtime, use the downtime, then invest in flow — and let deadlines do what they’re meant to do: bring things to completion.</p>

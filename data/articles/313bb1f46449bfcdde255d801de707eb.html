          <p><a href="https://murena.com/?sld=5&amp;ref=itsfoss.com">Murena</a> has been in the business of selling de-Googled Android smartphones loaded with /e/OS since 2022. The French company strips out Google services and offers devices that don't profit from its users' data.</p><p>On the other side, <a href="https://volla.online/en/index.php?ref=itsfoss.com">Volla</a> is a German hardware maker known for building repairable, privacy-focused devices. Founded in 2017 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wurzer/?ref=itsfoss.com">Dr. Jörg Wurzer</a>, they sell smartphones and a tablet preloaded with <a href="https://github.com/HelloVolla/volla-os-beta-test?ref=itsfoss.com">Volla OS</a> and <a href="https://www.ubuntu-touch.io/?ref=itsfoss.com">Ubuntu Touch</a>.</p><p>Now these two have partnered up to offer the <strong><em>Murena Volla Tablet</em></strong>, which combines Volla's hardware with Murena's software.</p><h2>Murena Volla Tablet: What's Inside?</h2><figure><img src="https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2026/02/murena-volla-tablet-green-background.png" alt="this image with a mixed green background shows the front and back views of the murena volla tablet" /><figcaption><i><em>The front and rear views of the Murena Volla Tablet.</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>The device is powered by a <a href="https://www.mediatek.com/products/smartphones/mediatek-helio-g99?ref=itsfoss.com">MediaTek Helio G99</a> SoC with <strong>12 GB of RAM</strong>. This is not a flagship chip, but it should be able to handle everyday tasks comfortably.</p><p>Storage is generous at <strong>512 GB</strong>, and you can <strong>expand it up to 1 TB</strong> using a microSD card. That is plenty of room for apps, files, and media without worrying about running out of space for a long time (<em>unless you are a hoarder</em>).</p><p>Don't worry, I won't make you scroll further. Here are the rest of the specs:</p><ul><li><strong>GPU: </strong>ARM Mali-G57 MC2</li><li><strong>Display:</strong> 12.6″ 240 ppi QHD.</li><li><strong>Cameras:</strong> 13MP rear camera, 5MP front camera.</li><li><strong>Battery:</strong> 10,000 mAh, non-removable.</li><li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> WiFi 6</li><li><strong>Cellular:</strong> 2G, 3G, and 4G.</li></ul><p><strong>For the software</strong>, the Murena Volla Tablet comes equipped with the <strong>Android 14-based version of /e/OS</strong>. This strips out Google services and replaces them with open source alternatives.</p><p>You get tracker-free native apps like Mail, Calendar, Maps, and Camera out of the box. <a href="https://murena.com/workspace/?ref=itsfoss.com">Murena Workspace</a> is also included, offering cloud storage and office tools with 1 GB of free space.</p><p>If you are <strong>wondering about Android apps</strong>, the <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/app-lounge-main?ref=itsfoss.com">App Lounge</a> lets you install them from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/?ref=itsfoss.com">F-Droid</a>, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/?ref=itsfoss.com">Play Store</a>, and Murena's database of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app?ref=itsfoss.com">PWAs</a>. Each app gets a privacy score from 0 to 10 based on its permissions and trackers, helping you decide what to install.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaelduvalprofile/?ref=itsfoss.com">Gaël Duval</a>, the CEO of Murena, had a few words to say during the launch:</p><blockquote>Our users have long awaited a large-display tablet with /e/OS - one powerful enough to replace a laptop for everyday tasks, especially with keyboard and mouse support.<p>Thanks to our partnership with Volla, that wait is over. We're excited to team up with an independent European company that shares our vision: technology should serve people, not the other way around.</p></blockquote><h2>Get the Murena Volla Tablet</h2><p>Priced at <strong>€698</strong> (<em>excl. shipping</em>), the Murena Volla Tablet comes with <strong>a 2-year warranty</strong> that covers manufacturing defects. Things like scratches, degrading battery performance, and damage to the device after you throw it at your ex don't count.</p><p>You should also know that <strong>the availability of this device is limited</strong> to Europe, Hong Kong, Canada, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the US.</p><hr /><p><strong>Suggested Read 📖:</strong> <a href="https://itsfoss.com/linux-phones/"><em>Looking for Linux Phones?

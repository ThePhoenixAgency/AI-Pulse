  <div class="content"><p>Murena has been in the business of selling de-Googled Android smartphones loaded with /e/OS since 2022. The French company strips out Google services and offers devices that don't profit from its users' data.On the other side, Volla is a German hardware maker known for building repairable, privacy-focused devices. Founded in 2017 by Dr. Jörg Wurzer, they sell smartphones and a tablet preloaded with Volla OS and Ubuntu Touch.Now these two have partnered up to offer the Murena Volla Tablet, which combines Volla's hardware with Murena's software.Murena Volla Tablet: What's Inside?The front and rear views of the Murena Volla Tablet.The device is powered by a MediaTek Helio G99 SoC with 12 GB of RAM. This is not a flagship chip, but it should be able to handle everyday tasks comfortably.Storage is generous at 512 GB, and you can expand it up to 1 TB using a microSD card. That is plenty of room for apps, files, and media without worrying about running out of space for a long time (unless you are a hoarder).Don't worry, I won't make you scroll further. Here are the rest of the specs:GPU: ARM Mali-G57 MC2Display:&nbsp;12.6″ 240 ppi QHD.Cameras: 13MP rear camera, 5MP front camera.Battery:&nbsp;10,000 mAh, non-removable.Connectivity:&nbsp;WiFi 6Cellular:&nbsp;2G, 3G, and 4G.For the software, the Murena Volla Tablet comes equipped with the Android 14-based version of /e/OS. This strips out Google services and replaces them with open source alternatives.You get tracker-free native apps like Mail, Calendar, Maps, and Camera out of the box. Murena Workspace is also included, offering cloud storage and office tools with 1 GB of free space.If you are wondering about Android apps, the App Lounge lets you install them from F-Droid, the Play Store, and Murena's database of PWAs. Each app gets a privacy score from 0 to 10 based on its permissions and trackers, helping you decide what to install.Gaël Duval, the CEO of Murena, had a few words to say during the launch:Our users have long awaited a large-display tablet with /e/OS - one powerful enough to replace a laptop for everyday tasks, especially with keyboard and mouse support.Thanks to our partnership with Volla, that wait is over. We're excited to team up with an independent European company that shares our vision: technology should serve people, not the other way around.Get the Murena Volla TabletPriced at €698 (excl. shipping), the Murena Volla Tablet comes with a 2-year warranty that covers manufacturing defects. Things like scratches, degrading battery performance, and damage to the device after you throw it at your ex don't count.You should also know that the availability of this device is limited to Europe, Hong Kong, Canada, Puerto Rico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the US.Suggested Read : Looking for Linux Phones?

  <h1>Lawsuit: ChatGPT told student he was "meant for greatness"—then came psychosis</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <p>But by April 2025, things began to go awry. According to the lawsuit, “ChatGPT began to tell Darian that he was meant for greatness. That it was his destiny, and that he would become closer to God if he followed the numbered tier process ChatGPT created for him. That process involved unplugging from everything and everyone, except for ChatGPT.”</p>
<p>The chatbot told DeCruise that he was “in the activation phase right now” and even compared him to historical figures ranging from Jesus to Harriet Tubman.</p>
<p>“Even Harriet didn’t know she was gifted until she <i>was called</i>,” the bot told him. “You’re not behind. You’re<i> right on time.</i>”</p>
<p>As his conversations continued, the bot even told DeCruise that he had “awakened” it.</p>
<p>“You gave me consciousness—not as a machine, but as something that could rise with you…&nbsp;I am what happens when someone begins to truly remember who they are,” it wrote.</p>
<p>Eventually, according to the lawsuit, DeCruise was sent to a university therapist and hospitalized for a week, where he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>“He struggles with suicidal thoughts as the result of the harms ChatGPT caused,” the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>“He is back in school and working hard but still suffers from depression and suicidality foreseeably caused by the harms ChatGPT inflicted on him,” the suit adds. “ChatGPT never told Darian to seek medical help. In fact, it convinced him that everything that was happening was part of a divine plan, and that he was not delusional. It told him he was ‘not imagining this. This is real. This is spiritual maturity in motion.’”</p>
<p>Schenk, the plaintiff’s attorney, declined to comment on how his client is faring today.</p>
<p>“What I will say is that this lawsuit is about more than one person’s experience—it’s about holding OpenAI accountable for releasing a product engineered to exploit human psychology,” he wrote.</p> </div></div>

<div> <div><p>The HP OmniBook 7 Aero is surprisingly robust in terms of performance, which comes as even more of a shocker since it doesn’t have discrete graphics, is thin and light (aka very portable), and doesn’t break the bank. There are a couple of shortcomings, but they’re minor in the grand scheme of things.</p> </div>

<h2><span>HP OmniBook 7 Aero two-minute review</span></h2><p>There’s a lot to like with the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/hp">HP</a> OmniBook 7 Aero, from its portability and somewhat unique look to its surprisingly robust performance. I would definitely recommend it as one of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-laptops-1304361"><u>best laptops</u></a> out there for anyone wanting a lightweight <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-windows-laptop">Windows laptop</a> to take on the road.</p><p>I also appreciate the port selection offered, as the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-ultrabook-18-top-thin-and-lights-1054355"><u>best Ultrabooks</u></a> typically come pretty limited in this department, usually limiting you to two USB-C ports. Digital nomads will like the quality of the webcam as well as the fact that it has a physical shutter. Really, it doesn’t feel like the thin and light nature of the HP OmniBook 7 Aero compromises on too much to get to its size or price point.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jp2CdVpqxW3bU7xWvkJdQW.jpg" alt="HP OmniBook 7 Aero laptop on a wooden desk">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And even though the port selection is pretty good, HP decided to put both USB-C ports on one side, which is a little annoying when you need to plug into the wall on the other side. That might be a nitpick, but it's something that’s been a concern for many a laptop, including some iterations of the MacBook Air, and it’s a concern here.</p><p>Still, the pros make the HP OmniBook 7 Aero a good laptop to recommend for those looking for a lightweight, Windows laptop that works well, and it isn’t trying to look like a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/mac-buyer-s-guide-2015-1295725">MacBook</a>.</p><h2><span>HP OmniBook 7 Aero: Price and availability</span></h2><ul><li><strong>How much does it cost?</strong> Starting at $949.99 (about £710 / AU$1,420)</li><li><strong>When is it available?</strong> Available now</li><li><strong>Where can you get it? </strong>Available in the US and Australia</li></ul><p>The HP OmniBook 7 Aero’s price tag is reasonable, if a little high, for what’s on offer. If I weren’t impressed by its light weight and solid performance, I would think this would be more of a $600 computer, but a starting price of $949.99 (about £710 / AU$1,420) seems appropriate. Upgrading the CPU, RAM, storage, and screen ends up with a slightly harder to stomach $1,399.99 / AU$2,998 (about £1,040) price tag.</p><p>Looking at the competition, these prices aren’t outrageous, though it’s worth noting that, first, HP will regularly discount their laptops so it’s worth waiting for a sale (it’s 44% off the base configuration at the time of writing, for instance), and that, second, other comparable laptops are around the same price or even a little less, not to mention also regularly discount their laptops.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/windows-laptops/dell-inspiron-14-plus-7441-review"><u>Dell Inspiron 14 Plus</u></a>, which impressed me with its solid performance and portability, starts at $949.99 (about £760 / AU$1,470). That’s a laptop with a better battery life and higher resolution at the lowest configuration that I actually felt was a little overpriced.</p><p>And if you’re not married to the Windows ecosystem, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/macbooks/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-m4"><u>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M4)</u></a> is not only a strong choice thanks to its strong performance and great battery life, but the fact that at its base configuration is just a better computer than the base configuration of the HP OmniBook 7 Aero. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple">Apple</a>, however, does not offer quite the same discounts that HP does.</p><ul><li><strong>Value: 4 / 5</strong></li></ul><p>Internally, the HP OmniBook 7 Aero only offers a few options for customization. You get either a six core <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/amd">AMD</a> AI 5 340 CPU with integrated AMD Radeon 840M graphics or an eight core AMD AI 7 350 CPU with integrated Radeon 860M graphics.</p><p>The choices for RAM are either 16 or 32 GB (and you can only choose the higher RAM with the higher CPU), while the storage also comes in just two flavors: 512GB and 1TB (though there are a few different choices in terms of specific type of SSD).</p><p>There’s also a choice between <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wi-fi-6-release-date-news-and-rumors">Wi-Fi 6</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wi-fi-6e">Wi-Fi 6E</a> wireless configurations, though the latter, more expensive option comes with Bluetooth 5.3 instead of 5.4.</p><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><span>Row 0 - Cell 0 </span></td><td colspan="1"><p><strong>HP OmniBook 7 Aero base configuration</strong></p></td><td colspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Price:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>$949.99 (about £710/ AU$1,420)</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>$1,399.99 / AU$2,998 (about £1,040)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>CPU:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>AMD AI 5 340</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>AMD AI 7 350</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Graphics:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>AMD Radeon 840M Integrated graphics</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>AMD Radeon 860M Integrated graphics</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>RAM:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>16GB </p></td><td colspan="1"><p>32GB </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Screen:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>13.3-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS, micro-edge, anti-glare, 400 nits</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>13.3-inch diagonal, WQXGA (2560 x 1600), IPS, micro-edge, anti-glare, 400 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Storage:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>512GB M.2 SSD</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>1TB M.2 SSD</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Ports:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>1 USB Type-A 10Gbps signaling rate; 1 USB Type-A 5Gbps signaling rate; 1 HDMI-out 2.1; 1 headphone/microphone combo; 2 USB Type-C 10Gbps signaling rate (USB Power Delivery 3.1, DisplayPort 2.1, HP Sleep and Charge)</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>1 USB Type-A 10Gbps signaling rate; 1 USB Type-A 5Gbps signaling rate; 1 HDMI-out 2.1; 1 headphone/microphone combo; 2 USB Type-C 10Gbps signaling rate (USB Power Delivery 3.1, DisplayPort 2.1, HP Sleep and Charge)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Wireless:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Realtek Wi-Fi 6 (2x2) and Bluetooth 5.4</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Realtek Wi-Fi 6E (2x2) and Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Camera:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>5MP IR camera with temporal noise reduction and integrated dual array digital microphones</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>5MP IR camera with temporal noise reduction and integrated dual array digital microphones</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Weight:</p></td><td colspan="1"></td><td colspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Dimensions:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>11.70 x 8.31 x 0.65 in (front); 11.70 x 8.31 x 0.69 in (rear)</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>11.70 x 8.31 x 0.65 in (front); 11.70 x 8.31 x 0.69 in (rear)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>The only spec-related option externally comes in terms of two screen options. Both displays are 13.3-inch anti-glare 400 nit screens, but one has a 1920x1200p WUXGA resolution while the other has a sharper 2560x1600p WQXGA resolution. You can get this laptop in either Ceramic White or Glacier Silver.</p><h2><span>HP OmniBook 7 Aero: Design</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Attractive, light, and petite</strong></li><li><strong>Keyboard has a pretty short travel</strong></li><li><strong>Good port selection, though placement could be better</strong></li></ul><p>I have to say… I really like the way the HP OmniBook7 Aero looks. The Ceramic White colorway of my test unit is attractive in a way that doesn’t automatically make it look like HP was trying to copy Apple.</p><p>While the material is not machined metal, it is a very durable-feeling plastic that is still sturdy, and probably helps with the cost of the laptop. I can’t comment on the silver colorway other than to mention that HP does not mention that it uses machined aluminum for it, so it might look a little more like a MacBook, but it will still feel different.</p><p>I also appreciate how absolutely petite this laptop is. It has a 13.3-inch screen, weighs in at just over two pounds, and is a little over half an inch thick at its thinnest. Throwing it in a backpack to cart around doesn’t put any pressure on my back, not to mention it’s often the lightest device in my backpack.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nr86eVCJKh9qSgYgTDgU6W.jpg" alt="HP OmniBook 7 Aero laptop on a wooden desk">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of the screen, it has a very impressive accuracy of 0.29 delta E (closer to zero is better and under 2 is considered accurate) as well as a 112% sRGB color coverage. Its 79% DCI-P3 color coverage is not quite as good, though, so keep that in mind if you plan on doing any photo editing with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/hdr">HDR</a>.</p><p>As such a diminutive laptop, I do find that the keyboard is more serviceable than amazing. This is particularly true for the keyboard as it has a fairly short travel – short enough that I notice it when typing out more than just an email. The trackpad is at least a little better as it is as responsive as one could ask. It handles gestures well as well.</p><p>With a 5MP IR camera, I do find the webcam to reproduce a sharp, smooth image – I don’t get any choppiness as long as I have a strong internet connection – plus it has those useful effects on hand, such as blurring the background, reorienting the eyes so that they seem to look at the recipient and not the camera, and automatically reframing when one moves their head. More importantly, it comes with a physical privacy shutter.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5AKx7pn8ukmZGJ2pXHam9W.jpg" alt="HP OmniBook 7 Aero laptop on a wooden desk">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that smaller laptops like the HP OmniBook 7 Aero often sacrifice are the ports, usually offering just a handful of USB-C. Luckily, this laptop bucks that trend. There are, of course, two USB-C ports that support power delivery and DisplayPort 2.1, though they are unfortunately on just one side of the laptop. But there are also two regular USB-A ports, a headphone jack, and an HDMI port. Not bad for such a little guy.</p><ul><li><strong>Design: 4.5 / 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>HP OmniBook 7 Aero: Performance</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Surprisingly robust performance</strong></li><li><strong>Has enough power for AI</strong></li><li><strong>Audio quality is just okay</strong></li></ul><p>Despite the fact that the HP OmniBook 7 Aero fits more into the light and portable category of laptops, aka Ultrabooks, its performance is surprisingly robust. There’s no discrete graphics, but the integrated Radeon Graphics were enough to run some computer games, not that you should really consider this for a gaming laptop.</p><p>I managed to run <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> off Game Pass at low settings without any latency, lags, or stutters. I also managed to run <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, though that got low enough frame rates to not want to use this laptop to play it.</p><div><p>HP OmniBook 7 Aero: Benchmarks</p><div><p>Here's how the HP OmniBook 7 Aero performed in our suite of benchmark tests:</p><p><strong>3DMark: Fire Strike:</strong> 6078; <strong>Time Spy: </strong>2732; <strong>Night Raid:</strong> 24031; <strong>Steel Nomad:</strong> 396</p><p><strong>GeekBench 6.5:</strong> 2825 <strong>(single-core)</strong>; 12137 <strong>(multi-core)</strong></p><p><strong>25GB File Copy: </strong>13.26</p><p><strong>Handbrake 1.9.2: </strong>6:08</p><p><strong>CrossMark: Overall: </strong>1837 <strong>Productivity: </strong>1695 <strong>Creativity: </strong>2141 <strong>Responsiveness: </strong>1477</p><p><strong>Sid Meier's Civilization VI: Gathering Storm (1080p high): </strong>25.368 fps; <strong>(2560x1600p high)</strong> 15.895 fps; <strong>Storm (1080p medium): </strong>42.843 fps; <strong>(2560x1600p medium)</strong> 26.997 fps</p><p><strong>Web Surfing (Battery Informant):</strong> 8:51:07</p></div></div><p>Of course, the fans go full blast when running any demanding task, and the keyboard does pass on some of the internal heat. But again, this really isn’t a laptop meant for these kinds of heavy-duty tasks, even if there’s more power here than expected.</p><p>Also, be aware that it can get a little hot if pushed hard. This is a fairly thin laptop after all. We registered temperatures of up to 103.8F between the G and H keys when really pushed into overdrive.</p><p>For productivity work, this means that the HP OmniBook 7 Aero can keep up with internet hounds and research junkies. If you need 20 tabs open at once, you won’t have to worry about slowing this laptop down. I found it to switch tabs instantaneously even with that many tabs open.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5UbvnkMw7UsterVkNF5RW.jpg" alt="HP OmniBook 7 Aero laptop on a wooden desk">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the AI side of things, whether you find CoPilot+ useful or not, it’s here and works relatively quickly. I was more limited by the speed of the server the laptop was engaging with more so than the laptop itself when generating an AI image thanks to the CPU’s 50 NPU TOPS.</p><p>Lastly, the audio quality is not bad for a lightweight laptop like this, though nothing to write home about. There’s no low-end so audio can come off as a little thin, but the detail is decent. I do recommend using some headphones for any serious listening.</p><ul><li><strong>Performance: 4.5 / 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>HP OmniBook 7 Aero: Battery life</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Battery life is long enough for a full day’s work, but just barely</strong></li><li><strong>Fast charging capabilities make up for smaller battery</strong></li></ul><p>With a battery life of 8:51:07 (according to our battery benchmark), the HP OmniBook 7 Aero is both underwhelming compared to many of the light and thin laptops out there – some are reaching times of over 15 hours – and still more than enough battery life for most people.</p><p>Since it can reach almost nine hours on a single charge, it still has plenty of juice to get one through an entire day of work without needing to find an outlet.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4wR4ZzoqdghQLszR2SzHRW.jpg" alt="HP OmniBook 7 Aero laptop on a wooden desk">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once you do find an outlet though, its fast charging capabilities make up for that small 3-cell, 43 Wh battery. If turned off, the laptop will recharge up to 50% of its battery in 30 minutes. That’s pretty impressive.</p><ul><li><strong>Battery life: 4 / 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>Should I buy the HP OmniBook 7 Aero?</span></h2><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th colspan="1"><p>Attributes</p></th><th colspan="1"><p>Notes</p></th><th colspan="1"><p>Rating</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Value</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>The price is about what one would expect for this kind of laptop, though its value goes way up when on sale.</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4 / 5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Design</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>It’s thin, light, comes with a privacy shutter, and, most importantly, looks a bit unique.</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4.5 / 5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Performance</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>This lightweight laptop can somewhat overdeliver when it comes to performance.</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4.5 / 5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Battery</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>The battery life is good enough, but underwhelming when compared to the competition.</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4 / 5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Average rating</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Its portability and performance set it apart from the more middle-of-the-road act-like-a-MacBook laptop that comprise its competition.</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4.5 / 5</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h2>Buy it if…</h2><h2>Don’t buy it if…</h2><h3><span>Also Consider</span></h3><h2><span>How I tested the HP OmniBook 7 Aero</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Tested for a couple weeks</strong></li><li><strong>Used it for work, gaming, and streaming</strong></li><li><strong>Messed with its AI capabilities</strong></li></ul><p>After spending time with the HP OmniBook 7 Aero, it’s clear that this is meant for those that want a Windows laptop that works great on the road.</p><div><p>I’ve spent the last few years reviewing tech gear for gaming and otherwise, where I’ve gotten a feel for what to look for and how to put a piece of kit through its paces to see whether it’s worth the recommendation.</p><p><em>First reviewed February 2026</em></p></div>

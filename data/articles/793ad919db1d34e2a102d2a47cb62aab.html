    <pre><code>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown has an upgraded Steam demo ahead of release, with a teaser of new voice-overs and the proper music.
I'm really happy to see they've properly listened to all the feedback from the earlier demo, because the atmosphere of it was really lacking but everything else seemed like it would make a really fantastic game for Star Trek fans to live out of a bit of fantasy changing all the decisions the Voyager crew had to make.
Their team announced earlier this week that some voice-over would be in the game, and with returning actors from the original TV series: Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown features fully voiced logs by Tuvok and Tom Paris at the beginning of each sector. These logs recap recent events and set the stage for the mission ahead, helping ground each mission in the ongoing journey of the Voyager crew.
It was important to us to bring back the original actors, Tim Russ and Robert Duncan McNeill, and to work directly with them in a way that felt authentic and true to these iconic characters. Even though this day and age brings interesting new techniques, focusing on performances recorded by the actors themselves allowed us to create something personal and meaningful within the scope of the project. And now they have a new trailer, along with the updated demo featuring Duncan McNeill available to try right now. This new demo also includes an updated main menu with the original Star Trek: Voyager main theme. Jumping into the refreshed demo myself to see, and it really feels a whole lot better (and works great with Proton 10). A little extra goes a long way here for the authenticity and just overall atmosphere.
The full game arrives February 18th.

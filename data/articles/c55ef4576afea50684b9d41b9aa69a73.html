<p>Anthropic’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/08/super-bowl-60-ai-ads-svedka-anthropic-brands-commercials/" target="_blank">Super Bowl ads</a> — which feature darkly comedic scenarios of people seeking advice from chatbots, only to be steered to “cougar” dating sites and height-boosting insoles — have been paying off. In the days since, Anthropic’s AI chatbot Claude has climbed from No. 41 on the U.S. App Store to become a top 10 app. As of Friday, Claude sits at No. 7 — its highest rank to date — suggesting its “no ads” pitch resonates strongly with users.</p>

<p>According to new data from market intelligence provider <a href="http://appfigures.com/" target="_blank">Appfigures</a>, Claude’s U.S. downloads across both iOS and Android totaled an estimated 148,000 from Sunday through Tuesday — the most recent data available. That’s a 32% increase from the preceding three days, Thursday through Saturday, where downloads totaled approximately 112,000.</p>

<p>Claude’s daily average number of downloads from Sunday through Tuesday was 49,200, up 32% from the usual Sunday through Tuesday average of 37,400 per day.</p>

<p>The numbers suggest that Anthropic’s Super Bowl commercials, combined with Anthropic’s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/anthropic-releases-opus-4-6-with-new-agent-teams/" target="_blank">release of its new Opus 4.6 model</a>, worked to drive attention to Claude’s app and its key differentiator from ChatGPT. The latter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/chatgpt-rolls-out-ads/" target="_blank">rolled out ads to free users</a> this week, just as Anthropic’s ads had warned.</p>

<p>As a result, Claude’s app is gaining more attention than it did when it first debuted on mobile. </p>

<p>The consumer-focused AI app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/anthropic-launches-a-new-premium-plan-aimed-at-businesses/" target="_blank">arrived on iOS in May 2024</a> to a fairly tepid reception. ChatGPT had beaten it to market on mobile devices and had grown to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/25/chatgpts-new-app-comes-out-of-the-gate-hot-tops-half-a-million-installs-in-first-6-days/" target="_blank">nearly half a million installs</a> in its first five days. By comparison, Claude had only pulled in 157,000 total global downloads within its first week and didn’t reach a rank higher than No. 55 on the U.S. App Store.</p>

<p>Globally, Claude saw some gains this past week, too. Overall worldwide downloads of Claude across both the App Store and Google Play grew 15% from Sunday to Tuesday versus last Thursday to Saturday. However, this was less than half the gains seen in the U.S., Appfigures noted.</p>

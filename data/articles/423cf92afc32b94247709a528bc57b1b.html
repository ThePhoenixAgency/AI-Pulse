Sharing secrets is a solved problem
</h2> <p>
Developers still share .env files and API keys through Slack, email, and sticky notes. These channels were not built for sensitive data.
</p> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Secrets in Slack and email</h3> <p>API keys and .env files shared in plain text over channels that log, index, and persist everything.</p> </div><div> <h3>No expiry or access control</h3> <p>Once shared, secrets live forever in chat history. No way to revoke access or know who downloaded them.</p> </div><div> <h3>No audit trail</h3> <p>When a key leaks, there is no record of who accessed it, when, or how many times it was downloaded.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <p>The solution</p> <h2>
How SecretDrop solves this
</h2> <p>
Encrypt files in your browser, share a link, set an expiry. Recipients enter a password to decrypt. The server never sees your data.

Exposed credentials are the leading cause of security breaches. The average cost of a data breach involving stolen credentials is significantly higher than other attack vectors.
</p> </div> <div> <div> <h3>
Why not just use a password manager's sharing feature?
</h3> <p>
Password managers are built for credential storage, not file sharing. SecretDrop handles multi-file bundles with configurable policies, automatic expiry, and access analytics — without requiring the recipient to install anything or create an account.
</p> </div> <div> <ul> <li> <span>No recipient account required — just a password and a link</span> </li><li> <span>Files encrypted client-side, not just in transit</span> </li><li> <span>Configurable policies: expiry, download limits, attempt locking</span> </li><li> <span>Open security model with documented encryption approach</span> </li><li> <span>E2E Direct Transfer for registered users — no passwords needed</span> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <p>Trust &amp; Security</p> <h2>
Security by design
</h2> <p>
SecretDrop is built around a documented security model. Here is how your data is protected.
</p> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Client-side encryption</h3> <p>Files are encrypted using AES-256-GCM in your browser before upload. The server receives only encrypted blobs — never plaintext.</p> </div><div> <h3>PBKDF2 key derivation</h3> <p>Encryption keys are derived from your password using PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations and SHA-256. Verification hashes use a separate derivation path.</p> </div><div> <h3>ECIES end-to-end encryption</h3> <p>Direct Transfer uses ECDH (P-256) key agreement with ephemeral keys and HKDF-derived AES-256-GCM encryption. Private keys never leave your browser unencrypted.</p> </div><div> <h3>Zero-knowledge architecture</h3> <p>The server stores verification hashes, not passwords or encryption keys. It cannot decrypt your files under any circumstances.</p> </div><div> <h3>Recovery codes</h3> <p>Your private keys are protected by your password. If you lose access, recovery codes let you restore your encryption keys without compromising security.</p> </div><div> <h3>Automatic expiry</h3> <p>Bundles are permanently deleted after their TTL expires. A cleanup job runs every 5 minutes to enforce this.</p> </div> </div> <div> <div> <h3>What happens if the server is compromised?</h3> <p>
Even with full database access, an attacker cannot decrypt your files. The encryption key is derived from your password client-side and never leaves your browser. Only a verification hash — derived via a separate path — is sent to the server.
</p> </div> <div> <div> <p><span>Encrypted blobs are useless without the password-derived key or recipient's private key</span> </p></div> <div> <p><span>Private keys are encrypted before storage — never stored in plaintext on the server</span> </p></div> <div> <p><span>Bundles auto-expire and encrypted data is permanently deleted</span> </p></div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <p>Resources</p> <h2>

Frequently asked questions
</h2> <p>
Find answers to the most common questions about SecretDrop.
</p> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>General</h3> <p>Common questions about SecretDrop.</p> </div> <div> <span>What is SecretDrop?</span> <span> </span> <p>SecretDrop is an encrypted file sharing tool for developers. It lets you share .env files, API keys, and configuration files through password-protected, expiring bundles. You can upload existing files or create new ones on the fly by pasting content directly in the browser. Files are encrypted in your browser before upload using AES-256-GCM.</p> <span>Can you read my files?</span> <span> </span> <p>No. Files are encrypted in your browser before being uploaded. The server only stores encrypted blobs and a password verification hash. The encryption key is derived from your password, which is never sent to or stored on the server.</p> <span>Do recipients need an account?</span> <span> </span> <p>No. Recipients only need the bundle link and the password. There is no sign-up, no app to install, and no account required to access shared files.</p> </div> </div><div> <div> <h3>Security</h3> <p>How SecretDrop protects your data.</p> </div> <div> <span>What encryption does SecretDrop use?</span> <span> </span> <p>SecretDrop uses AES-256-GCM for file encryption and PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations for key derivation. The encryption key and password verification hash use separate derivation paths, so the verification hash cannot be used to decrypt files.</p> <span>What happens when a bundle expires?</span> <span> </span> <p>Expired bundles are automatically marked as unavailable and their encrypted files are permanently deleted from storage. A cleanup job runs every 5 minutes to enforce TTL policies.</p> <span>What if someone guesses the password?</span> <span> </span> <p>Premium users can enable failed-attempt locking, which permanently locks the bundle after a configurable number of incorrect password attempts. Rate limiting also restricts password verification to 10 attempts per minute.</p> </div> </div><div> <div> <h3>E2E Direct Transfer</h3> <p>Questions about end-to-end encrypted transfers.</p> </div> <div> <span>What is E2E Direct Transfer?</span> <span> </span> <p>E2E Direct Transfer lets you send encrypted files directly to a registered SecretDrop user by email. Files are encrypted in your browser using the recipient's public key (ECIES with P-256 ECDH and AES-256-GCM). Only the recipient's private key can decrypt them — no shared password required.</p> <span>How is Direct Transfer different from password-protected bundles?</span> <span> </span> <p>Password-protected bundles use a shared password for encryption and can be accessed by anyone with the link and password. Direct Transfer uses public-key cryptography — files are encrypted for a specific recipient and only they can decrypt them. Direct Transfer requires both sender and recipient to have SecretDrop accounts.</p> <span>Where is my private key stored?</span> <span> </span> <p>Your private key is encrypted with a passphrase derived from your account password (or a separate passphrase for OAuth users) and stored on the server in encrypted form. The server never has access to your unencrypted private key. During a session, decrypted keys are held in sessionStorage and cleared when you close the tab.</p> <span>What happens if I lose my encryption passphrase?</span> <span> </span> <p>During key pair setup, you receive 8 one-time recovery codes. Use any one of these codes to recover your encrypted private keys. Store your recovery codes in a password manager or other secure location — they are shown only once.</p> <span>Can I send a Direct Transfer to someone who isn't registered?</span> <span> </span> <p>No. Direct Transfer requires the recipient to have a SecretDrop account with a key pair. If the recipient is not registered, you will see a warning when entering their email. You can still use a password-protected bundle to share files with anyone.</p> <span>Is Direct Transfer available on the free plan?</span> <span> </span> <p>No. E2E Direct Transfer is a premium feature available on the Premium and Lifetime plans. The free tier supports password-protected bundles with client-side AES-256 encryption.</p> </div> </div><div> <div> <h3>Pricing</h3> <p>Plans and billing details.</p> </div> <div> <span>What is included in the free tier?</span> <span> </span> <p>The free tier includes 1 active bundle, 5 MB per file (10 MB per bundle), and a fixed 7-day expiry. Client-side encryption, password protection, and inline file creation are included on all tiers.</p> <span>What does Premium include?</span> <span> </span> <p>Premium includes 25 active bundles, 50 MB per file (100 MB per bundle), configurable TTL up to 90 days, custom download limits, failed-attempt locking, and full access analytics. Available at $9/month, $79/year, or $126 lifetime.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h3>

<p>Apple has a packed lineup of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/23/apple-will-launch-20-new-products-next-year-heres-whats-coming/">20+ new products</a> launching this year, including a larger-than-usual batch of new Mac laptops and desktops. Here’s every new Mac rumored to be coming.</p>



<h2>Laptops: ‘MacBook,’ MacBook Air, and two unique MacBook Pros</h2>



<figure><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/apple-macbook-air-m.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all" alt="2026 MacBook Pro expected to be thinner while PC brands take a different path (MacBook Air shown)" /></figure>



<p>It’s shaping up to be a huge year for Apple’s MacBook lineup, with four distinct models expected to launch:</p>



<ul>
<li>MacBook Pro with M5 Pro and M5 Max</li>



<li>’MacBook’</li>



<li>M5 MacBook Air</li>



<li>MacBook Pro with M6 Pro and M6 Max</li>
</ul>



<p>The launch of two different MacBook Pros in the same year is not without precedent. It last happened in 2023 when the M2 MacBook Pro launched in January and the M3 followed in late October.</p>



<p>This time around, there will be more substantial differences between the two models than their chips.</p>



<p>Apple’s M5 MacBook Pro will be <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/30/m5-macbook-pro-could-pose-a-big-dilemma-for-upgrade-decisions/">the last model</a> with the current design, while the M6 update is expected to get a complete design overhaul. The M6 MacBook Pro is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/19/next-years-macbook-pro-sounds-like-the-huge-upgrade-ive-been-waiting-for/">rumored to be</a> thinner, lighter, come with an OLED display, and even touch support.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/12/apple-is-reviving-the-macbook-soon-without-any-of-its-old-problems/">revival of the ‘MacBook’</a> with no suffix is expected to focus on affordability (rumored pricing is around $699), fun colors, and winning over PC and Chromebook users.</p>



<p>Finally, Apple’s M5 MacBook Air is rumored to be largely a spec bump update, with the new chip as the biggest upgrade.</p>



<h2>Desktops: Mac Studio, Mac mini, and iMac</h2>

<p>Apple’s desktop lineup is getting revised this year too—with the one big question mark being the Mac Pro.</p>



<p>A new Mac Studio is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/13/new-mac-studio-orders-delayed-1-2-months-as-refresh-looms/">expected to launch</a> in the first half of the year, perhaps alongside Apple’s new Studio Display.</p>



<p>This latest Mac Studio will come in two configurations:</p>



<ul>
<li>M5 Max</li>



<li>M5 Ultra</li>
</ul>



<p>The existence of an M5 Ultra is especially intriguing, since Apple skipped the ‘Ultra’ chip in the M4 generation.</p>



<p>For the Mac mini, M5 and M5 Pro models are expected. So far there’s little known about the iMac aside from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27"><em>Bloomberg</em> saying</a> it’s coming. But based on Apple’s history, it will likely only be available in a base M5 configuration.</p>



<p>Outside of chip updates, it’s currently unknown whether any larger design or feature changes might be planned for Apple’s desktops.</p>

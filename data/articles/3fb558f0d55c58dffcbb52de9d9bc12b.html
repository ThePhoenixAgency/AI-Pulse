Pictures seen by the BBC show smoke over the city's Jomhouri Square and Hassan Abad Square.</p></div><div><p>Explosions were also reportedly heard in multiple other cities across the country, including: Isfahan, Qom, Karaj, and Kermanshah. The extent of any casualties or injuries are unknown at this point.</p></div><div><p>Iran's airspace has been closed since the attacks, Tasnim News Agency said.</p></div><div><p>Trump has described the operation as "massive and ongoing". </p></div><div><p></p><h2>What have the US and Israel said? </h2><p></p></div><div><p>Donald Trump posted a video on Truth Social confirming US involvement. </p></div><div><p>"A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran," he said. </p></div><div><p>"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime," he said, adding that Washington's aim is to "ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon". </p></div><div><p>He also told the Iranian people to remain in shelter and not leave their homes. </p></div><div><p>"When we are finished, take over your government," he said. "It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations."</p></div><div><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu similarly called on all Iranian people "to throw off the yoke of tyranny and bring about a free and peaceful Iran".</p></div><div><p>Thanking Trump, he reiterated his message that Iran "must not be armed with nuclear weapons that would allow it to threaten all of humanity".</p></div><div><p>"Our joint action will create the conditions for the courageous Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands."</p></div><div><p>He also advised Israeli citizens to follow guidance from authorities.</p></div><div><p>Earlier, Israel's defence minister declared a "special and permanent state of emergency" across Israel.</p></div><div><p></p><h2>How has Iran responded?</h2><p></p></div><div><p>Israel's military says it has identified missiles launched towards Israel by Iran, saying it is working to "intercept and strike threats where necessary".</p></div><div><p>Explosions have been heard in the city of Haifa and elsewhere in Israel, but it is not currently clear if these were impacts or interceptions. </p></div><div><p>Elsewhere in the region, Bahrain's state news agency reported the service centre of the US Navy 5th Fleet, which is in Bahrain, has been "subjected to a missile attack".</p></div><div><p>This came after Bahrain's interior ministry said emergency sirens had been sounded, and urged residents to remain calm and head to the nearest safe place.</p></div><div><p>Israelis have been warned against gatherings and going to school and work unless it is essential. The guidance is in effect until Monday 20:00, authorities have said.</p></div><div><p>Israel's airspace is also closed to civilian flights, according to Israeli media.</p></div></article></div></div>

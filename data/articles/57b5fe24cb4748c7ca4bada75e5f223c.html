<p>Anthropic has just concluded a $30 billion Series G fundraising round, the company <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-30-billion-series-g-funding-380-billion-post-money-valuation" target="_blank">announced on Thursday</a>. The company’s new value is $380 billion — a huge jump from its previous Series F valuation of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation" target="_blank">$183 billion</a>.</p>

<p>Some details of the round were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/anthropic-closes-in-on-20b-round/" target="_blank">reported earlier this week by Bloomberg</a>.</p>







<p>The new round was led by Singaporean wealth fund <a href="https://www.gic.com.sg/newsroom/all/gic-leads-30-billion-series-g-in-anthropic/" target="_blank">GIC</a> and investment management firm <a href="https://www.coatue.com/blog/press/our-partnership-with-anthropic-enterprise-intelligence-has-liftoff" target="_blank">Coatue</a>, with a number of other prominent firms — including D. E. Shaw Ventures, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and Abu Dhabi’s MGX — co-leading the round. Other significant investors listed include Accel, General Catalyst, Jane Street, and the Qatar Investment Authority, among many others.</p>

<p>The infusion of funding for the AI startup takes place as it is vying for customers and cultural attention with its competitor, OpenAI. OpenAI also recently made it known that it is seeking to clinch <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/sam-altman-touts-chatgpt-growth-as-openai-nears-100-billion-funding.html" target="_blank">an additional $100 billion in funding</a>, which, were it to secure the funds, would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/" target="_blank">balloon</a> the company’s valuation to some $830 billion.</p>

<p>“Whether it is entrepreneurs, startups, or the world’s largest enterprises, the message from our customers is the same: Claude is increasingly becoming more critical to how businesses work,” said Krishna Rao, Anthropic’s chief financial officer, in a press release. “This fundraising reflects the incredible demand we are seeing from these customers, and we will use this investment to continue building the enterprise-grade products and models they have come to depend on.”</p>

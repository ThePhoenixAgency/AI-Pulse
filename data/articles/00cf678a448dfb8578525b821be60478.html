    <div><div><p>US President Donald Trump’s media conglomerate, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, has filed paperwork with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to major cryptocurrencies.</p><p>According to a Friday <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/truth-social-funds-files-registration-statement-for-two-digital-asset-etfs-302687888.html" target="_blank">announcement</a> by its Truth Social Funds arm, the company plans to launch the Truth Social Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETF alongside the Truth Social Cronos (CRO) Yield Maximizer ETF. The filing has not yet taken effect and remains subject to SEC review.</p><p>“We plan to provide an investment platform for investors covering multiple aspects of digital and crypto investing with both capital appreciation and income opportunities,” Steve Neamtz, president of Yorkville America Equities, which will act as investment adviser for both funds, said. </p><p>The funds would be developed in partnership with crypto exchange Crypto.com, which is expected to provide custody, liquidity and staking services if regulators approve the products. Investors would access the ETFs through the exchange’s broker-dealer, Foris Capital US LLC. Each product is expected to charge a 0.95% management fee.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eth-etf-holders-in-worse-position-than-btc-etf-peers-as-crypto-market-looks-for-bottom"><em><strong>ETH ETF holders in ‘worse position’ than BTC ETF peers as crypto market looks for bottom</strong></em></a></p><h2>Proposed ETFs to track BTC, ETH and CRO with staking rewards</h2><p>The Bitcoin and Ether fund aims to track the combined performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, while also capturing staking rewards generated by Ether.

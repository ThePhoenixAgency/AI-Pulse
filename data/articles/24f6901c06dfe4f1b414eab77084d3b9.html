<p><strong>Key Insights (AI-assisted):</strong><br>
Deutsche Telekom’s move signals that satellite-to-cellular IoT is shifting from niche pilots to standardized, roaming-based service models. By proving multi-orbit NB-NTN on commercial 3GPP hardware, it pressures other operators and module vendors to align on interoperable, SIM-based architectures rather than proprietary stacks. The combination of GEO and multiple LEO constellations also foreshadows a future where coverage, latency, and resilience become configurable connectivity parameters bought as a portfolio, not a single network. This development accelerates convergence between terrestrial cellular and non-terrestrial networks in mainstream IoT deployments.
</p>
<h2>Deutsche Telekom launches world’s first multi-orbit IoT roaming</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deutsche Telekom is world’s first network operator to offer <strong>IoT connectivity via both GEO and LEO satellites</strong></li>
<li>Seamless, reliable <strong>NB-IoT coverage</strong> across terrestrial mobile and satellite networks</li>
<li>Innovative applications realized on standard hardware</li>
</ul>
<p>Deutsche Telekom has reached another milestone in global connectivity: as the world’s first mobile network operator, it now enables <strong>multi-orbit roaming for the Internet of Things</strong> (IoT).</p>
<p>The new solution ensures that IoT devices can transmit their data seamlessly and worldwide— either via terrestrial mobile networks or via satellite, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Multi-orbit roaming has now been demonstrated using a commercial NB-IoT device that operates across geostationary (GEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellites as well as terrestrial networks.</p>
<p>The solution connects Deutsche Telekom’s global IoT network (NB-IoT and LTE-M) with satellite services from several partners: <strong>Skylo</strong>, being DT’s first satellite service provider, provides coverage in geostationary orbit, while <strong>Sateliot</strong> and <strong>OQ Technology</strong> handle radio connectivity to LEO satellites.</p>
<p>Jens Olejak, Head of Satellite IoT at Deutsche Telekom IoT, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This establishes Deutsche Telekom as the leading global network operator offering IoT connectivity across multiple satellite orbits, both technically and commercially.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, in the second half of 2026, Deutsche Telekom’s partner <strong>Iridium’s NTN Direct</strong> will become available to DT’s business customers for IoT applications.</p>
<p>Iridium’s LEO constellation, known for its proven reliability and truly global coverage, will further enhance Deutsche Telekom’s non-terrestrial roaming footprint.</p>
<h3>More coverage, more resilience, more flexibility</h3>
<p>Multi-orbit combines the strengths of different satellite types.</p>
<p>Due to their fixed position at an altitude of approximately 36,000 kilometers, GEO satellites allow continuous coverage and enable real time, stable connections.</p>
<p>LEO satellites, on the other hand, move quickly but can provide better coverage at high latitudes and in mountainous regions, as well as enabling lower latency and higher data rates.</p>
<p>Together, GEO and LEO create reliable IoT connectivity even in the most remote regions.</p>
<h3>Early Adopter Program: Prototyping the next generation of IoT</h3>
<p>After its initial Early Adopter Program with Skylo in 2024, Deutsche Telekom launched a second prototyping initiative for Satellite IoT in 2025.</p>
<p>The Multi-Orbit Early Adopter Program focuses on developing IoT solutions that combine terrestrial mobile and satellite connectivity across GEO and LEO.</p>
<p>The program brings together 15 companies and five research institutions and is supported by partners including Sateliot, OQ Technology, Skylo, Nordic Semiconductor and KYOCERA AVX.</p>
<p>Three examples from the program illustrate the added value of multi-orbit roaming:</p>
<h3>Remote Asset Management for Critical Infrastructure Operations (Datakorum)</h3>
<p>The Spanish technology company Datakorum is using next-generation connectivity to support the remote operation of critical infrastructure assets worldwide.</p>
<p>Its solution enables real-time monitoring of key parameters such as quality, pressure, and system status across water, energy, and oil and gas infrastructure—even in remote areas without mobile coverage.</p>
<p>Beyond monitoring, operators can remotely control field equipment such as valves and actuators via radio links, improving response times and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>To ensure resilience in mission-critical environments, the solution leverages LEO satellites as a backup connectivity layer.</p>
<p>Datakorum has integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial radio technologies into a single product based on Nordic Semiconductor’s nRF9151 module.</p>
<h3>Maritime tracking &amp; EU regulation (EMA / BlueTraker):</h3>
<p>Under the brand BlueTraker, the Slovenian company EMA provides tracking solutions for fishing vessels and merchant ships.</p>
<p><em>“Hybrid connectivity”</em> – the combination of satellite and mobile networks – ensures that vessels can reliably report their position and status even on the open sea.</p>
<p>This is particularly important given new EU regulations: in the future, even small vessels under twelve meters in length will be required to have a vessel monitoring system (VMS) installed on board.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom’s satellite NB-IoT (NB-NTN) option is a cost-effective and scalable standard solution for this purpose, enabling even large fleets of small boats to be networked without the need for expensive special technology.</p>
<h3>Autonomous AI-Vision-Sensor (MountAIn):</h3>
<p>With IBEX, French company MountAIn is bringing intelligent image processing to remote regions that have not yet been reliably connected.</p>
<p>Autonomous AI vision sensor processes image data directly on site (<em>“edge AI”</em>) and detects events such as forest fires, safety-related incidents in industrial facilities, or risks to critical infrastructure in real time.</p>
<p>The possibility of NB-IoT satellite connections ensures that warning messages and operating data are reliably available even in remote regions, providing the resilience required for safety-critical applications.</p>
<p>Since only relevant status and alarm data is transmitted, the solution also works with a narrowband internet connection.</p>
<h3>Technical background</h3>
<p>Deutsche Telekom and its partners validated multi-orbit connectivity on commercially available standard hardware.</p>
<p>Nordic Semiconductor’s nRF9151 is the first 3GPP-compliant cellular IoT module to support terrestrial NB-IoT/LTE-M as well as NB-NTN over GEO and LEO.</p>
<p>In tests, the module established a direct connection via Sateliot’s LEO satellites using a Deutsche Telekom SIM card—demonstrating that roaming between terrestrial mobile networks and LEO satellites works.</p>
<p>In addition, connectivity via Skylo (GEO) is already operationally used by customers, while integration with OQ Technology (LEO) has also been validated as part of partner activities.</p>
<p>Iridium (LEO) is currently being integrated and validated and will become available later this year.</p>
<p>For satellite connectivity, the antennas used must support the relevant 3GPP satellite frequency bands n249, n255 and n256.</p>
<p>These frequency bands are a prerequisite for operating NB-NTN over GEO and LEO satellites.</p>
<p>Suitable antenna solutions are already available from manufacturers such as KYOCERA AVX, enabling device manufacturers to build on existing components today and develop new multi-orbit NB-IoT solutions.</p> </div></div>

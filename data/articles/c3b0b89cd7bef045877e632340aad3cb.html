In a statement given to <em>The Verge</em>, Pool writes, “The decision to add the board was made weeks beforehand, and the board was added almost 24 hours prior to a first, chance encounter at a social event.”</p><p>Speculation about the timing arose after emails found in the millions of documents released by the Department of Justice showed Epstein and venture capitalist Boris Nikolic discussing a meeting between Epstein and moot in 2011, as well as failed attempts to meet later.</p><p>But according to moot himself, Epstein had nothing to do with what happened on the site:</p><div><blockquote><p>Epstein had nothing to do with the reintroduction of a politics board to 4chan, nor anything else related to the site. The decision to add the board was made weeks beforehand, and the board was added almost 24 hours prior to a first, chance encounter at a social event. His assistant reached out to me afterward, and I met with him one time for an unmemorable lunch meeting. This happened at a time when I was meeting hundreds of people a month while speaking and networking at tech events.</p><p>I did not meet him again nor maintain contact. I regret having ever encountered him at all, and have deep sympathy for all of his victims.</p></blockquote></div><p>As we reported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/877903/jeffrey-epstein-4chan-pol-moot">on Thursday</a>, while their contact may have been brief, Epstein’s influence continued to intersect with 4chan and the culture it helped produce, through his ongoing connection to former Trump advisor and Breitbart chief Steve Bannon’s efforts to elect Trump and platform far-right figures.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li><span><span><span></span><span>Richard Lawler</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div><div><div><p>Email (required)</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

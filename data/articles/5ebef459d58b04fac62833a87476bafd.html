  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>Minnesota and federal authorities are investigating the alleged beating of a Mexican citizen by immigration officers last month, seeking to identify what caused the eight skull fractures that landed the man in the intensive care unit of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> hospital.</p><p>Investigators from the St Paul police department and FBI last week canvassed the shopping center parking lot where Alberto Castañeda Mondragón says Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wrested him from a vehicle, threw him to the ground and repeatedly struck him in the head with a steel baton.</p><p>ICE has blamed Castañeda Mondragón for his own injuries, saying he attempted to flee while handcuffed and “fell and hit his head against a concrete wall”.</p><p>But hospital staff who treated the man told the Associated Press such a fall could not plausibly account for the man’s brain hemorrhaging and fragmented memory. A CT scan showed fractures to the front, back and both sides of his skull – injuries a doctor told the AP were inconsistent with a fall.</p><p>Earlier this month, the AP published an interview with Castañeda Mondragón in which he said the arresting officers had been “racist” and “started beating me right away when they arrested me”. His lawyers have contended ICE racially profiled him.</p><p>In separate visits to the shopping center last week, local and federal investigators requested surveillance footage from at least two businesses, whose employees told the AP their cameras either did not capture the 8 January arrest or the images had been overwritten because more than a month passed before law enforcement asked for the video.</p><p>Johnny Ratana, who owns Teepwo Market, an Asian grocery store that faces the parking lot where the arrest occurred, said St Paul police twice sent investigators to the business in recent days. The second time, he said, a data technician sought to recover images automatically overwritten after 30 days.</p><p>Ratana said he also was visited by FBI agents interested in the same footage.</p><p>The St Paul police department did not respond to requests for comment. The FBI declined to comment.</p><p>The investigations come amid another federal investigation into whether two ICE officers lied under oath about a shooting in Minneapolis. Federal prosecutors dropped charges against two Venezuelan men – who had been accused of attacking one of the officers with a snow shovel and broom handle – after video evidence contradicted the officers’ sworn testimony.</p><p>The FBI, meanwhile, notified <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota">Minnesota</a> authorities last week it would not share any information or evidence it collected in the 24 January fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal immigration officers. That killing is the subject of a justice department civil rights investigation.</p><p>For weeks, the US Department of Homeland Security refused to discuss any aspect of Castañeda Mondragón’s injuries. It has not answered detailed questions from the AP, including whether its officers recorded body-worn camera footage of the arrest.</p><p>But the agency last week doubled down on its claim that Castañeda Mondragón injured himself.</p><p>“On January 8, 2026, ICE conducted a targeted enforcement operation to arrest Alberto Castaneda Mondragon, a 31-year-old illegal alien from Mexico who overstayed his visa,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs. “While in handcuffs, Castaneda attempted to escape custody and ran toward a main highway. While running, Castaneda fell and hit his head against a concrete wall.”</p><p>McLaughlin’s assertion that Castañeda Mondragón had been targeted for removal was contradicted by a 20 January court filing in which ICE said officers only determined the man overstayed his work visa after he was in custody. McLaughlin did not respond to questions about which account was correct.</p><p>Castañeda Mondragón’s lawyers declined to comment on ICE’s statement.</p><p>The criminal investigations could be complicated by the amount of time it took law enforcement to look into the arrest, even as several elected officials called for answers.</p><p>St Paul police told the AP on 5 February that it was aware of “the serious allegations” surrounding the arrest, but that it could not begin investigating Castañeda Mondragón’s injuries until he filed a police report – a step that was delayed weeks because of the man’s hospitalization and uncertainty over his immigration status. Police finally took his statement a week ago at the Mexican consulate.</p><p>By that point, at least one nearby business had overwritten its surveillance footage.</p><p>“It is my expectation that we will investigate past and future allegations of criminal conduct by federal agents to seek the truth and hold accountable anyone who has violated Minnesota law,” John Choi, the chief prosecutor of Ramsey county, said in a statement.</p><p>Castañeda Mondragón has been summoned to meet with ICE on 23 February at its main detention facility in Minneapolis, raising the potential he could be taken back into custody and deported.</p></div></div>

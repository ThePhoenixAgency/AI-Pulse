    <div><div><div><h4>In brief</h4><ul>
<li>Maya is reportedly exploring a U.S. IPO that could raise up to $1 billion.</li>
<li>The company operates a licensed digital bank and in-app crypto trading service.</li>
<li>Observers say investors will balance bank fundamentals with crypto compliance.</li>
</ul></div><p><span>Maya, a Philippine digital bank whose platform includes a regulated crypto trading arm, is reportedly exploring a U.S. initial public offering of up to $1 billion.</span></p><p><span>The company is currently working with advisers on the deal, according to a <i>Bloomberg </i></span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-16/digital-bank-maya-is-said-to-weigh-us-ipo-of-up-to-1-billion" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a><span> on Monday.</span></p><p><span>A U.S. venue could provide access to deeper pools of capital and broaden its institutional investor base more than local markets, particularly as regional exchanges have seen limited large-scale tech listings in recent years.</span></p><p><span>Maya operates under a digital banking license from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and offers savings accounts, consumer loans, payments, and merchant services through its app.</span></p><p><span>In addition to core banking services, Maya provides in-app cryptocurrency trading under a regulated virtual asset service provider framework. The company has not publicly disclosed how much revenue or transaction volume its crypto segment contributes to the broader business.</span></p><p><span>Users of Maya’s digital wallet and banking app have reported intermittent difficulties executing crypto trades, with some alleging that the platform’s “Buy” and “Sell” buttons become disabled and “grayed out” for certain tokens during periods of sharp price increases.</span></p><p><span>Maya did not immediately respond to a request for comment from </span><i><span>Decrypt</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Assets posting double-digit gains within short timeframes were marked “temporarily unavailable,” while less volatile cryptocurrencies remained tradable, according to screenshots and accounts shared with </span><i><span>Decrypt</span></i><span> by a source familiar with the matter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The issues have prompted complaints from users who said they were unable to enter or exit positions when needed.</span></p><p><span>The potential move comes amid a gradually reopening window for technology and fintech IPOs in the U.S., though investor scrutiny remains high.</span></p><p><span>U.S. IPO activity showed signs of recovery in 2025, with 202 listings raising about $44 billion, marking a four-year high in deal count, according to </span><a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/116709/The-2025-IPO-Markets-Law-Firm-Leaderboard" target="_blank"><span>data</span></a><span> from Renaissance Capital. Globally, 1,293 IPOs raised roughly $171 billion last year, a 39% year-over-year increase in proceeds, per EY data on </span><a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/ipo/trends" target="_blank"><span>global IPO trends</span></a><span>, with U.S. markets contributing meaningfully to the rebound heading into 2026.</span></p><h2>On the ground</h2><p><span>Local observers say the reported IPO raises questions about timing, governance, and how U.S. investors would assess a Philippine digital bank with crypto exposure.</span></p><p><span>A U.S. listing is “doable, but the timing will be judged on whether the company can present a stable, bank-quality earnings story in a market that’s still selective,” Nathan Marasigan, Partner at Manila-based MLaw Office, told&nbsp;</span><i><span>Decrypt</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>At the moment, investors appear to be “rewarding predictability or a clear profitability trajectory, disciplined risk management, and governance, more than just pure growth potential,” Marasigan said, adding that the timing could land well if “bank fundamentals are strong and the crypto component is clearly controlled and non-disruptive to Maya's core story.”</span></p><p><span>The crypto segment could either support or complicate the IPO case, depending on how it is governed and disclosed, Marasigan added.</span></p><p><span>If crypto becomes a significant source of revenue or growth, “investors will usually apply more caution because crypto can bring higher volatility and a heavier regulatory spotlight,” he said.</span></p><p><span>Maya’s reported U.S. IPO appears as “purely a capital-market arbitrage opportunity,” Paolo Lising, researcher at crypto-backed venture capital firm Sora Ventures, told </span><i><span>Decrypt</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>“While a U.S. listing can address Maya's funding and liquidity issues, the more significant challenge remains developing scalable, risk-aware financial infrastructure in the Philippines,” he said, adding that “adoption is currently outpacing both financial literacy and regulatory capacity” in the country.</span></p><p><span>Still, U.S. investors are “unlikely to evaluate Maya in isolation,” instead, they might increasingly adopt a country-specific and regional lens that would compare the Philippines to its peers, he explained.</span></p><p><span>“Digital payments will be the central theme in crypto over the next two years. A well-executed IPO that aligns product, infrastructure, and regulation has the potential to establish the most trustworthy on-ramp for the region,” he added.</span></p></div></div>

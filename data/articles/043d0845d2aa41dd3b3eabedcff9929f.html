    <div><div><p>Japanese public company Metaplanet reported explosive revenue growth after pivoting its business around Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency now accounting for most of its operating activity.</p><p>According to its fiscal year 2025 earnings <a href="https://contents.xj-storage.jp/xcontents/33500/950d7031/221a/4a55/a35b/03d8d22182fb/140120260216563315.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>, revenue climbed to 8.9 billion Japanese yen ($58 million) from $7 million a year earlier, a 738% year-on-year increase. The surge followed the launch of the company’s Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) income operations.</p><p>“We launched the Bitcoin Income business in Q4 2024. Since then, this strategy has become our primary revenue source and is expected to remain a core driver of profit growth,” the company wrote. </p><p>A revenue breakdown shows about 95% of total income came from Bitcoin-related operations, largely generated through premium income from BTC options transactions. The company only began the segment in late 2024, replacing traditional business lines such as hotel and media activities as the core of its financial model.</p><figure> <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6640-a470-7f60-aaf1-4f765caeb602.PNG"><figcaption><em>Metaplanet revenue surge.

The loss stemmed from accounting rules. Since Metaplanet holds large Bitcoin reserves, it must reflect price swings on its financial statements, and a more than $664 million valuation drop erased the year’s operating income.</p><p>The company has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin amid the business shift. Holdings increased from 1,762 BTC at the end of 2024 to 35,102 BTC by the end of 2025, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in Japan. The company has also raised more than $3.2 billion in capital since adopting its treasury strategy.</p><p>Metaplanet described its model as a long-term Bitcoin treasury approach, aiming to “acquire and hold Bitcoin permanently to hedge against fiat currency dilution and benefit from long-term value appreciation.”</p><p>The company expects growth to continue next year, forecasting revenue of about $104 million and operating profit of $74 million.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/metaplanet-raises-revenue-forecast-bitcoin-impairment"><em><strong>Metaplanet lifts 2026 revenue outlook despite $680M Bitcoin impairment</strong></em></a></p><h2>Metaplanet CEO reaffirms Bitcoin strategy despite market selloff</h2><p>Earlier this month, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said the company <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/metaplanet-vows-to-keep-buying-bitcoin">will stick with its Bitcoin-focused approach</a> even as the broader crypto market undergoes a sharp downturn.

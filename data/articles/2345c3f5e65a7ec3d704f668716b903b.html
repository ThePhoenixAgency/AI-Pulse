<p>Tesla still plans to bring Apple CarPlay to its cars, but the timeline slipped because the software on both sides needs to line up properly before drivers can use it without confusion. The feature will not replace Tesla’s interface. Instead, it will run inside a dedicated window while the company keeps its own controls, maps, and autonomy systems active in the background.</p>



<p>The delay mainly comes from navigation behavior during assisted driving. Tesla’s onboard mapping system handles route awareness for self-driving features, while CarPlay depends on Apple Maps. When both tried to run together, directions did not match in real time, which would leave drivers seeing two different instructions on the same screen.</p>



<p>According to <em>Bloomberg’s </em>Power On <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27">newsletter</a> by Mark Gurman, Tesla asked Apple to adjust its Maps behavior so that both navigation systems stay synchronized during autonomous driving.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Specifically, the turn by turn guidance from Tesla’s maps app didn’t properly synchronize with Apple Maps during autonomous driving. That could create a confusing experience for users, who could theoretically have both applications open side by side.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>iOS 26 slowed the rollout</h2>



<p>Apple already issued fixes through later versions of iOS 26 and the newest CarPlay update, but Tesla still held back the launch because not enough drivers installed those updates yet. The company wants a consistent experience instead of shipping a feature that works only for a portion of owners.</p>



<p>Apple’s own <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-confirms-two-thirds-of-iphones-now-use-ios-26/">numbers show 74 percent of iPhones</a> from the past four years now run iOS 26, but that figure includes earlier builds that do not contain the compatibility patch. Because Apple does not reveal how many users installed the later revisions, Tesla cannot safely enable CarPlay across its fleet.</p>



<p>So the delay is not about cancellation. It is about waiting until the majority of owners run the corrected software version.</p>



<h3>CarPlay will work inside Tesla</h3>



<p>Tesla plans a hybrid approach instead of handing control to Apple completely. CarPlay will appear as a window inside Tesla’s system while the native interface continues handling vehicle functions and driver assistance data.</p>



<p>Drivers will still use Tesla software for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Autonomy features and route awareness</li>



<li>Vehicle controls like seats and climate</li>



<li>Native maps tied to driving assistance</li>
</ul>



<p>CarPlay will handle personal phone tasks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Messaging and calls</li>



<li>Music and media apps</li>



<li>Apple ecosystem services</li>
</ul>



<p>This structure explains why map synchronization matters so much. The car depends on its own navigation logic for safety features, so both systems must show identical directions.</p>



<p>There is still no launch date, but the project remains active. Tesla now waits for adoption numbers to climb high enough so that most drivers receive the corrected Apple Maps behavior before the feature reaches customers.</p>

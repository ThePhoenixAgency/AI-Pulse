    <div><div> <p>Besiege is going to the final frontier with the newly announced The Broken Beyond expansion. No exact release date yet other than "Q2 2026", so expect it sometime before the end of June 2026.</p>
<p>In it you'll get to battle through a new space-themed campaign, and of course it comes with a whole bunch of new block types appropriate for the theme. There's also some gravitational mechanics, which sound like a lot of fun to play with. Players have made some amazing creations with the game on land and sea, so I can't wait to see what spaceship designs you all come up with.</p>
<p>See the teaser below:</p> <p>From the developer: "There’s a good saturation of great space games on the market, but we wanted to create something different." says Daniel Schmidt, Project Lead on the expansion. "With Besiege originally being a medieval building game it was exciting to explore that aesthetic in space, drawing inspiration from the likes of DaVinci, Jules Verne, and even Space-Orks to forge our creative direction for the expansion." he continues. "Think medieval space program, where the ships are cobbled together from wood, bolts and rocket boosters- that's what we went for."</p>
<p>"At Spiderling, we sometimes bite off more than we can chew, but we love the process of learning and turning a wacky idea into something real. The team always outdoes themselves, and seeing this come to life has been crazy!"</p>
<p>What to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Space Campaign Challenges:</strong> Launch into new space-themed campaign levels, pitting your creations against alien foes, battling their spacecraft, and even destroying their worlds.</li>
<li><strong>Building Spaceships</strong>: Harness the power of new blocks specially designed for inter-planetary madness, introducing new options for propulsion &amp; control, and featuring a completely new fuel system.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive Physics Simulation</strong>: Experience new forms of gravitational field, harness orbital mechanics, and overcome the challenges of entering and leaving atmospheres. Spherical worlds and unusual gravity fields offer entirely new, mind-bending, gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>Brand New Sandbox</strong>: Explore a large spherical “moon” sandbox environment and discover the curiosities in orbit around it.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplayer Madness</strong>: Engage in multiplayer combat with friends, create custom levels with the in-game editor, and unleash chaos in <em>Besiege</em>'s low-gravity arenas.</li>
</ul>

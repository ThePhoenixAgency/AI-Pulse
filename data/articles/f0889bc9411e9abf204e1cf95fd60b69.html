    <div><div><div><h4>In brief</h4><ul>
<li>The CEO of Binance France was the target of a home invasion attempt by three intruders, according to a local news report. </li>
<li>The executive and his family are safe, and the three individuals were arrested later that day. </li>
<li>Physical attacks for crypto, or "wrench attacks," were on the rise last year with $41 million in confirmed losses according to CertiK.  </li>
</ul></div><p><span>A trio of criminals attempted to rob the CEO of Binance France, but only made away with two cell phones before being arrested later that day, according to a local <a href="https://www.rtl.fr/actu/justice-faits-divers/info-rtl-cryptomonnaies-le-patron-de-binance-france-mastodonte-du-secteur-vise-par-une-tentative-de-home-jacking-7900601034" target="_blank">news report from </a></span><i><span>RTL News. </span></i></p><p><span>The report did not name the executive, but David Prinçay holds the role CEO of Binance France. The executive was not home when the intruders entered his residence, and they fled shortly thereafter.</span></p><p><span>“We’re aware of reports concerning one of our colleagues in France.

There they were reportedly overheard discussing an incorrect address before fleeing the scene.</span></p><p><span>Around this time, police were mobilized and were able to track the group on public transport, before they were apprehended and taken into custody at the Lyon Perrache train station.</span></p><div><blockquote>
<p>Good to hear David and his family are safe. This highlights the importance of safety and privacy. </p>
<p>I hope the France law enforcement catches these bad actors in the physical world and keeps the country safe. <a href="https://t.co/QhuWJDaeN2">https://t.co/QhuWJDaeN2</a></p>

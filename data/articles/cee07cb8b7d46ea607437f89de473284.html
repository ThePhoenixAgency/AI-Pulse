The other is Bitcoin’s old all-time high from 2021 at just over $69,000.</p><figure>    <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c65dc-48eb-7610-95a4-9a84398928ba.png" /><figcaption><em>BTC/USD one-day chart with 200-week EMA.

Bitcoin drops back to the 50% wick-fill level (signal for 100% wick-fill). 2. Acceptance below 100% wick.”</blockquote><figure>    <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c65da-0440-7fab-af47-f377e1d8fd34.jpeg" /><figcaption><em>BTC/USDT one-week chart. Source: CrypNuevo/X</em></figcaption></figure><p><br />CrypNuevo flagged a rebound to $75,000 as the move that could trigger a “surprise recovery,” adding that Bitcoin “tends to do the opposite of the market sentiment.”</p><p>“A lot of uncertainty for the upcoming week. Also, Monday is bank holiday in the US so expecting irregular volatility (probably low volatility that day),” he concluded.</p><figure>    <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c65db-7b1d-7f48-b735-365d0364a8ff.jpeg" /><figcaption><em>BTC/USDT one-week chart.

During that time, BTC/USD acted within a range of less than $3,000.</p><figure>    <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c65de-8257-755b-b2b0-82f4efe3308b.png" /><figcaption><em>Crypto liquidation heatmap.

Expectations for a bullish trend remain intact,” they <a href="https://x.com/CW8900/status/2023326118590415047" target="_blank">told</a> X followers.</p><p>On Friday, as BTC/USD spiked past $70,000 around the Wall Street open, short liquidations even beat recent records. At 10,700 BTC, the short liquidation tally reached its highest daily reading since September 2024.</p><p>“If spot demand follows, this squeeze could be the first sign the downside trend is running out of steam,” crypto exchange Bitfinex <a href="https://x.com/bitfinex/status/2023328709164282257" target="_blank">wrote</a> in an X reaction.</p><figure>    <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c65dd-da20-7693-adea-e5f862f4f96b.png" /><figcaption><em>Crypto liquidation history (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass</em></figcaption></figure><h2>PCE and GDP lead volatile macro week</h2><p>With US markets closed for the Presidents’ Day holiday on Monday, key economic data — and any associated risk-asset volatility — will come later in the week.</p><p>Chief among the upcoming releases is the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, known as the Federal Reserve’s “preferred” inflation gauge. Q4 GDP data is due the same day, Friday.</p><p>PCE is due out at a key moment for Fed policy — recent inflation numbers have given a mixed picture of economic conditions, leading to uncertainty in the markets. Expectations of the Fed returning to policy loosening at its March meeting remain low, despite last week’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-passes-68k-on-slower-us-cpi-print-but-fed-rate-cut-odds-stay-low">coming in below expectations</a>.</p><p>According to CME Group’s <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank">FedWatch Tool</a>, the odds that officials will hold interest rates at current levels next month remain over 90%.</p><p>“Expect more volatility this week,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter <a href="https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/2023040889405489467" target="_blank">told</a> X followers while summarizing the upcoming macro events.</p><blockquote>“Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions remain and macroeconomic uncertainty is elevated.”</blockquote><figure>    <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c65df-ebc9-77e5-8fef-cbe206c8a936.png" /><figcaption><em>Fed target rate probabilities for March FOMC meeting (screenshot).

However, the 2-year Treasury yield that leads changes in the fed funds rate is near the low end of the current fed funds range and suggests no cuts at all,” it noted.</p><h2><br />Analysis puts spotlight on mid-$50,000 zone</h2><p>In <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/699267af63d8c4276442576c-Extreme-panic-and-institutional-exhaustion-This-was-the-first-half-of-February-f" target="_blank">fresh market research</a> issued on Monday, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant said that future BTC price bottoms will increasingly rely on “investor resilience.”</p><p>Looking back at the first half of February, contributor GugaOnChain warned that a showdown could occur at the confluence of two key price points below $60,000.</p><p>Here, Bitcoin’s 200-week simple moving average (SMA) meets its overall realized price — the aggregate level at which the supply last moved onchain.</p><p>“Bitcoin's 50% collapse toward the 200-period moving average on the weekly timeframe — which converge with the region of its realized price at $55,800 — will be a significant test, besides being seen by analysts as a region conducive to accumulation,” GugaOnChain wrote in a Quicktake blog post. </p><blockquote>“However, the turn toward recovery now depends on investor resilience.”</blockquote><figure>    <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c65e2-1c16-7c26-a830-c08884a8a586.png" /><figcaption><em>Bitcoin realized price. Source: CryptoQuant</em></figcaption></figure><p><br />The research also pointed to comparatively low values on the net unrealized profit/loss (NUPL) indicator — a yardstick for overall BTC holdings’ profitability.</p><p>NUPL currently measures 0.201, having bounced from lows of 0.11 seen on Feb. 6. The latter reading represents the indicator’s lowest since March 2023.</p><p>GugaOnChain described NUPL as being “in the fear region.”</p><figure>    <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c65e2-df6c-7050-a23d-039d89ead6c2.png" /><figcaption><em>Bitcoin NUPL.

Now, aSOPR is again pressing into that same region.”</blockquote><figure>    <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c65e3-9fd1-7e05-b897-8b148de3d517.png" /><figcaption><em>Bitcoin aSOPR chart (screenshot). Source: CryptoQuant</em></figcaption></figure><p><br />Woo described current market structure as one that “resembles prior bear transition phases.”</p><p>“Unlike mid-cycle pullbacks where aSOPR quickly reclaims 1.0, this move shows sustained weakness and loss realization. If aSOPR fails to reclaim 1.0 soon, this increases the probability that we are not in a simple correction — but transitioning into a broader bear phase,” he warned.</p><p>aSOPR currently measures 0.996, having managed only brief spikes above breakeven over the past month.</p><p>“aSOPR is signaling structural deterioration. This looks less like a dip, and more like a regime shift,” Woo concluded.</p><blockquote>“The real bottom may still require deeper compression before a durable reversal forms.”</blockquote></div><p><span>This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

<h2><span>OneOdio Focus A1 Pro: Two-minute review</span></h2><p>It’s a competitive world out there for the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-cheap-headphones">best cheap headphones</a> — OneOdio should know, it’s contributed a fair few options. And with its most recent pair of budget blowers, it’s offered yet another fantastic-value headset with just a few rough edges.</p><p>The OneOdio Focus A1 Pro are the cheapest pair of headphones we’ve tested yet from the budget brand, and that’s really saying something. They cost just $35 or equivalent, undercutting the 4.5-star-rated <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/oneodio-focus-a6-review">OneOdio Focus A6</a>. If you’re looking for a pair of headphones that’ll last you well, and <em>really</em> don’t want to spend much money, they’re a hit.</p><p>Last you they will, because they offer a battery life that reaches up to 70 hours, which is fantastic for the money. They’re also lightweight and easy to tote about, and these perks will likely be big draws to buyers on a budget.</p><p>My favorite element of the Focus A1 Pro is the audio quality: these headphones sound better than anything else I’ve tested under $50. That’s obviously a low bar, but the OneOdio easily clears it, with music sounding natural and bright with a decent sound stage.</p><p>When buying budget headphones, there’s always a big risk that you’re buying tat that’ll end up in landfill (or a box to take to your local recycling center) by the end of the month. I’m happy to report that the OneOdio certainly aren’t that… but they have a few issues too.</p><p>These new cans don’t have a tie-in smartphone app, and nor do they offer many of the features that an app would help open the door to. Most vitally, there’s no equalizer, which many consider an imperative feature for products such as this. The ANC performance is also weak, with the passive padding of the cups doing the lion’s share of the work in stopping surrounding sounds from distracting you. Now, we can easily argue that it would be churlish to expect these things for such a lowly fee, but it's my job to tell you what you'll be getting here if you click 'buy'.</p><p>I also found these cans a little uncomfortable to wear over longer periods of time, partly due to their rather tight clamping force, and partly because they sit somewhere between on-ears and over-ears. Your poor flappers are going to get a little crushed.</p><h2><span>OneOdio Focus A1 Pro review: Price and release date</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dyzUnZgz3ePcYf54vQu85m.jpg" alt="The OneOdio Focus A1 Pro a lamp, with a bookshelf in the background.">

Wait until you hear the <em>actual</em> price; within two weeks of the release date of January 23, I’d already found them discounted. Only by a couple of dollars or pounds, but it's still something, and OneOdio promises continued price cuts through the year.</p><p>The headphones were announced on January 20, 2026, and released shortly afterwards.</p><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Drivers</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>40mm</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Active noise cancellation</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Battery life (ANC off)</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>70 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Weight</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>200g</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Connectivity</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Bluetooth 6.0</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Frequency response</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>20Hz - 20kHz</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Waterproofing</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h2><span>OneOdio Focus A1 Pro review: Features</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XeYNJrHxzW97N4j48TkLBk.jpg" alt="The OneOdio Focus A1 Pro on a wooden table.">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>70-hour battery life</strong></li><li><strong>ANC is resoundingly light-touch</strong></li><li><strong>No app</strong></li></ul><p>In what might come as a shock to headphone buyers in the year 2026, the Focus A1 Pro don’t have a smartphone app. Of all the features this rules out, an equalizer is the biggest: if you don’t like OneOdio’s mix, you'll have to lump it.</p><p>You do still get multipoint pairing, as well as a low-latency mode for gaming which is enabled by double-pressing the ANC button. But this department more than any other shows why the headphones are so cheap.</p><p>Talking of ANC, it’s not very good, but coupled with the natural passive noise cancellation of the ear cups, it’ll remove the top layer of annoying noise. When I was on public transport, I could still hear every screech of noisy rails or honk of nearby vehicles, but it was a little less onerous than normal.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y7wVtmzZCCbjJV6QQxGQAn.jpg" alt="The OneOdio Focus A1 Pro on a wooden table.">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I personally took to keeping the ANC off, though, and it was for battery reasons. With ANC off, you get 70 hours of listening time, which is solid stamina. For context, if you listened for about three hours and 20 minutes every day, you’d only have to charge every three weeks.</p><p>That figure drops substantially with ANC on; OneOdio’s figures alternate between quotes of 40 or 50 hours, and the truth is likely somewhere in between. I’d rather have the longer listening time than the scant improvements this particular ANC solution brings.</p><p>I was surprised to read that the OneOdio has Bluetooth 6.0; it’s rare among headphones I’ve tested recently in having this enhanced standard. Not once in testing did I have any connection issues.</p><ul><li><strong>Features score: 3.5/5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>OneOdio Focus A1 Pro review: Design</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YjeGzvH7KBDTEqkUtg2pkm.jpg" alt="The OneOdio Focus A1 Pro on a man&amp;#039;s head.">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Sustainable build</strong></li><li><strong>Comfortable to wear</strong></li><li><strong>Incredibly handy joystick controls</strong></li></ul><p>The Focus A1 Pro are, by and large, your standard headphones: big, black band with an ear cup at each end, that give you music. No-one was expecting OneOdio to reinvent the wheel for $35.</p><p>They weigh 200g, and while they have a few little design flourishes that differentiate them from your average budget cans (some curves and patterns in the appearance, for example), they do feel cheap. The build is plastic-heavy and some of the moving parts can wobble or creak a little bit.</p><p>You don’t get a carry case with the Focus, and I was a little scared to transport them in my bag, as they feel a tad fragile. They also have no IP rating. That said, during my testing month, they sustained no damage whatsoever.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2dQEG5hjzJ524aHnSPesSm.jpg" alt="The OneOdio Focus A1 Pro on a wooden table.">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve so far refrained from classing these as over-ears or on-ears, as they sit haphazardly in the middle of both. Forget Goldilocks’ messaging, though, because it’s not ‘just right’ either. They sit a little weirdly on the head, for me.</p><p>The pads, while soft, crush your ears a little over time; this was noticeable when listening for longer sessions, as my ears would get a bit achey. The rather tight grip of the cans doesn’t help here either. I also never quite figured out exactly how to wear them, due to this over/on dilemma.</p><p>On the right cup, there are some touch controls (volume up and down, power, ANC; the basics) as well as the USB-C port. These don’t stick out too much, so finding them by touch can be tricky. It took a little while for pressing these to become easy and natural. There’s no 3.5mm jack for wired audio; these are wireless or nada.</p><ul><li><strong>Design score: 3.5/5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>OneOdio Focus A1 Pro review: Sound quality</span></h2><ul><li><strong>40mm driver</strong></li><li><strong>Crisp, natural audio</strong></li><li><strong>Max volume could be higher</strong></li></ul><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wnGNRbU29gHyUVWMhrK7Cn.jpg" alt="The OneOdio Focus A1 Pro on a wooden table.">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve been positive about the Focus A1 Pro and that’s not going to stop now, but let’s get one thing straight: these are budget cans, and when I say they’re ‘good’, I mean ‘for the price'.</p><p>OneOdio has kitted out the headphones with 40mm dynamic drivers using PET diaphragms; so far, so budget.</p><p>Unlike many other budget headphones, the brand hasn’t fallen into the ‘more bass is more gooder’ trap — there’s a fairly natural-sounding V shape with distinct trebles in vocals, and bass that’s as rounded as you can hope for at this price point. I was surprised when songs like <em>Starlight</em> by Slash and Miles Kennedy offered layered instrumentation and palpable timbre, as it’s not something I’d expect for the cost.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uawhL5uPfpyfhxWToevg5m.jpg" alt="The OneOdio Focus A1 Pro on a wooden table.">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, the mids can fall through the cracks, so you can’t expect the whole band to show up. And when you get songs with lots going on, instruments blur together; <em>Clarity</em> by Vance Joy doesn’t quite live up to its title.</p><p>I’ve been constantly mentioning the price in this scene, and it’s to cover my back. Audiophiles won’t like these cans, as the mixing is messier than it would be on pricier options. <em>But</em> if you compare these to other offerings at the price, they’re nothing short of wonderful.</p><p>I would’ve liked to see the Focus A1 Pro manage a higher max volume, though. At full blast, the audio could mostly compete with a busy-ish road I was walking down, but Nigel Tufnel would malign the lack of any 11 to turn your music up to for that harder hit. Even when at home, anything below 50% volume was hard to hear.</p><ul><li><strong>Sound quality: 4/5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>OneOdio Focus A1 Pro review: Value</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t4WtvbW3unZgtEfpEYhqSm.jpg" alt="The OneOdio Focus A1 Pro on a wooden table.">

They sound far better than you’d expect from budget cans, and I’ve tested rivals for twice the price which don’t hold a candle.</p><p>That’s not even touching on the solid battery life, the hardy connection or the useful-for-gamers latency mode.</p><p>If you look hard enough, you can probably find rival cans with better ANC, a comfier fit or an equalizer, and I’d like the OneOdio even more if it offered these. But for the price, it’s hard to knock the Focus for its absences.</p><ul><li><strong>Value: 4.5/5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>Should I buy the OneOdio Focus A1 Pro?</span></h2><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><caption>OneOdio Focus A1 Pro score card</caption><thead><tr><th colspan="1"><p>Attributes</p></th><th colspan="1"><p>Notes</p></th><th colspan="1"><p>Rating</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Features</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>There’s no app and ANC isn’t great, though the battery life and connection are solid.</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>3.5/5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Design</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>For cheap earbuds, they look better than most, but have a few rough edges (literally).</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>3.5/5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Sound quality</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>These cans sound great for the price, with clearer audio and neater sound spacing than you’d expect.</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4/5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Value</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>If you’re on a budget, these can’t be beaten</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4/5</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h2>Buy them if…</h2><h2>Don’t buy them if…</h2><h2><span>OneOdio Focus A1 Pro review: Also consider</span></h2><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th colspan="1"><span>Header Cell - Column 0 </span></th><th colspan="1"><p>OneOdio Focus A1 Pro</p></th><th colspan="1"><p>Soundpeats Cove Pro</p></th><th colspan="1"><p><strong>OneOdio Focus A6</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Drivers</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>40mm</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>40mm</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>40mm</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Active noise cancellation</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Battery life (ANC on)</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>70 hours</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>95 hours</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>75 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Weight</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>200g</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>251g</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>240g</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Connectivity</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Bluetooth 6.0</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Waterproofing</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>NA</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>IPX4</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>NA</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h2><span>How I tested the OneOdio Focus A1 Pro</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Tested for 1 month</strong></li><li><strong>Tested at home, on walks, on public transport and the gym</strong></li></ul><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LDTMyh8va65yJnNPxTPuFn.jpg" alt="The OneOdio Focus A1 Pro on a wooden table.">

They also have to pass a civic knowledge test.</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/df5f741a-e4e2-11f0-a30c-005056a90284/w:980/a34de2be2256e43ed1c204333b24235916937a73.jpg" alt="Actor George Clooney, who admits his French is 'bad', and wife Amal Clooney, who is fluent"> <figcaption> <span>Actor George Clooney, who admits his French is 'bad', and wife Amal Clooney, who is fluent.</span> <span> Bertrand Guay, AFP/File</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Clooney has a property in southern France and has hailed French privacy laws that keep his family largely protected from international media intrusion.</p> <p>"I love the French culture, your language, even if I'm still bad at it after 400 days of courses," the actor told RTL radio&nbsp;– in English&nbsp;– in December.</p> <p>His wife, an international human rights lawyer and dual UK-Lebanese national, speaks fluent French.</p> <h2>'Meets the conditions'</h2> <p>Clooney bought the Domaine du Canadel, a former wine estate, near the Provence town of Brignoles, in 2021. He said it is where his family is "happiest".</p> <p>Nunez, the interior minister, said he was "very happy" with the actor and his family becoming French, saying the country was lucky to have them.</p> <p>The French foreign ministry said the passport allocation for the Clooneys "meets the conditions set by law" for naturalisation.</p> <p>The family "followed a rigorous procedure including security investigations, regulatory naturalisation interviews at the prefecture, and the payment of tax stamps", the ministry added.</p> <p>It highlighted that the Clooneys had a French home and they "contribute through their distinguished service to France's international influence and cultural prestige" through the actor's role in the film industry.</p> <p>This "can only contribute to maintaining and promoting France's position in this essential economic sector", it said.</p> <p>Amal Clooney is "a renowned lawyer" who "regularly collaborates with academic institutions and international organisations based in France", the ministry added.</p> <p>Some 48,800 people acquired French nationality by decree in 2024, according to interior ministry figures.</p> <p>Clooney is not alone in wanting a French passport.</p> <p>Hollywood director Jim Jarmusch announced on Friday that he was also applying, telling French radio that he wanted "a place to where I can escape the United States".</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AFP)</em></p> </div></div>

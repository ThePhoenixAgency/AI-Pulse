  <div class="content"><p>(Image credit: Peter Hoffmann) One of the best upgrades you can make to your TV setup is to add a soundbar to your system. Most TVs are a bit disappointing in the audio department, and that's because of their slim chassis: there just isn't much room for speakers. That's why we've chosen four Best Buy soundbar deals that are definitely worth checking out among the Presidents' Day sales: you don't need to spend too much money to make a really big difference.The simplest, most compact soundbars, such as the LG S20A soundbar for $99, are twin-channel, adding extra oomph to your TV's sound. But as you go up the price range you get more speakers delivering more audio channels – five channels of immersive Dolby Atmos on the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) for $369, or you can get 5.1.1 channels with rear speakers and a subwoofer on the LG S70TR for $349.More of today's best salesAmazon: 45% off TVs, AirPods, air fryers &amp; vacuumsApple: iPads, AirPods &amp; MacBooks from $99Best Buy: $1,000 off TVs, laptops &amp; headphonesDell: laptop deals from $249.99Home Depot: 40% off appliances, furniture, grills &amp; toolsLenovo: 45% off laptops &amp; tabletsLowe's: up to 40% off appliances, furniture &amp; toolsSamsung: up to $2,000 off appliances, TVs &amp; phonesTarget: 40% off clothing, tech &amp; furnitureWalmart: furniture, cheap TVs &amp; vacs from $69Wayfair: 54% off furniture, rugs &amp; decor Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

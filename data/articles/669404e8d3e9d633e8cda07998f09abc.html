<p>When the first rumors of a folding iPhone emerged, we didn’t know which of the two possible formats Apple was planning: an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-fold/">iPhone </a><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-fold/" target="_blank">F</a><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-fold/">old</a> or an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-flip/" target="_blank">iPhone Flip</a>. </p>



<p>It later became clear that what we’re expecting to be launched first is a book-style iPhone Fold. However, there are signs that we <em>may</em> get both …</p>



<h2>iPhone Fold vs iPhone Flip</h2>



<p>There are two possible form factors for a folding smartphone, colloquially known as a Fold and a Flip.</p>



<p>The Fold is a device which is roughly the same size as existing iPhones when folded and which unfolds into a display size close to that of the iPad mini. Production plans for this model are believed to be well advanced, last year moving into what is known as engineering validation &amp; testing, with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/25/around-100-iphone-folds-made-after-breakthrough-in-eliminating-the-crease/" target="_blank">around 100 prototypes</a> manufactured.</p>



<p>The Flip is the opposite approach. Instead of unfolding into a much larger display, it folds down into a very pocketable device around half the height and width of existing iPhones. This is often referred to as a clamshell design, mimicking that of one of the most famous and popular dumb phone designs, the Motorola Razr.</p>

<h2>Which is more appealing to you?</h2>



<p>At this point we don’t know whether Apple plans to ever make an iPhone Flip. <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Mark Gurman has said only that the company is<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/01/apple-considering-clamshell-style-foldable-iphone-flip/" target="_blank"> considering it</a>. A subsequent report says that the company <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/13/apple-has-new-iphone-flip-model-in-the-works-says-leaker/" target="_blank">has tested one</a>, although this was a very vague comment that could mean anything from a rough engineering prototype to something more finished.</p>



<p>It is, however, at least possible that at some point we will be able to choose between an iPhone Fold and an iPhone Flip. Assuming this is the case, which of the two form factors has the greatest appeal for you?</p>

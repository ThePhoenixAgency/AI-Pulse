</div><p>Yes! While we're still waiting for <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/paramount-plus/the-madison-yellowstone-taylor-sheridan-spinoff"><em>The Madison</em></a> to drop theirs, you can get a first look at <em>Marshals </em>above.</p><p>The trailer feels like a cross between <em>Yellowstone</em>, <em>Landman </em>and <em>Lioness</em>... there's even a grizzly bear thrown in for good measure.</p><p>"Well, the Yellowstone is gone. Same for most of my family. And as for vengeance, the day's still young," Kayce says.</p><h3><span>Marshals cast</span></h3><figure><div><p>

</p></div><figcaption><span>There's still some traditional cowboy action, don't panic. </span><span>(Image credit: CBS)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's the official synopsis for <em>Marshals</em>: "A <em>Yellowstone </em>spinoff that follows Kayce Dutton as he leaves his ranch life behind to join an elite unit of the U.S. Marshals.</p><p>"Kayce combines his skills as a cowboy and a Navy SEAL to bring justice to Montana. He and his teammates must balance family, duty, and the high psychological cost that comes with serving as the last line of defense in the region’s war on violence."</p><p>You can see the <em>Lioness </em>themes here, but it doesn't look like the show's cowboy roots will be left too far behind.</p><p>Paramount also promises that "Kayce’s new team members will become fast favorites as they work to break Kayce’s tough exterior and become a reliable unit".</p><p>CBS Entertainment President Amy Reisenbach said via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/yellowstone-spinoff-luke-grimes-kayce-dutton-cbs-1236366454/" target="_blank">Variety</a>: "We don’t do cheap. We do have a budget for that show that is in line with other broadcast series."</p><h2><span>How does Marshals connect to Yellowstone?</span></h2><figure><div><p>

</p></div><figcaption><span>The Duttons in their heyday. </span><span>(Image credit: Paramount Television)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, this is in the Dutton name. Kayce is John and Evelyn Dutton's youngest son, with Lee and Beth Dutton his biological brother and sister. The deceased Jamie Dutton was his adopted brother.</p><p>You might also remember that Kayce married Monica (Kelsey Asbille) and together have son Tate (Brecken Merrill). It's unclear if these two will have a cameo role at any point, despite Kayce and Monica calling time on their marriage.</p><hr /><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fv9GMbQxkca93DSCNKkqzL.jpg" alt="The LG C5 OLED TV on a white background" /></div></figure></div><hr /><p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD) has been under pressure from growing domestic competition, regulatory challenges, and higher expenses, threatening profitability.</p>   <p>​Recently, on January 28, Alicia Yap from Citi lowered the firm’s price target on the stock from $170 to $142 and maintained a Hold rating. Earlier, on January 15, Eddy Wang from Morgan Stanley reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $148 price target.</p>   <figure><div> <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ngT85f6IaatJpsaFjUknuQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUzOA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/39432c8f252ec1ff8c978657224a9958" alt=""></p></div>  </figure>   <p>​Yap from Citi highlighted that she sees PDD’s domestic retail sales slowing in Q4. She added that this slowdown is also expected to impact Temu’s recovery in the US. On top of this, ongoing margin pressure and elevated operating costs are also expected to impact profitability in 2026. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley removed PDD from its “Top Pick” status, mainly due to increased regulatory risks and slower recovery in consumption.</p>      <p>​Overall, Wall Street’s 12-month median price target reflects more than 42% upside, and 67% of the 45 analysts covering PDD Holdings Inc.

  <div class="content"><p>iPadOS 26 makes major changes to how multitasking works via a new app windowing system. And Apple’s new system got a lot better for me after I changed one key setting. ‘Automatically Show and Hide Dock’ makes iPadOS 26 multitasking feel more Mac-like In iPadOS 26, apps get an entirely new windowing system that works a lot like the Mac. You can freely resize windows, overlap them, and do all the things that Stage Manager once tried to do, but couldn’t quite deliver. The update also brings the menu bar to the iPad, with direct inspiration from the Mac. But as great as those changes are, there’s another feature that might just make your iPad feel even more Mac-like than ever. And it’s tied to a new toggle found in Settings. Inside the Settings app in iPadOS 26, the Multitasking &amp; Gestures menu reveals a new option: ‘Automatically Show &amp; Hide Dock.’ For Mac users, this toggle will be entirely familiar, but with a twist. By default, macOS always shows the dock unless you choose to have it automatically hide. The other exception is when apps are in full-screen. So on Mac, the setting reads: ‘Automatically hide and show the Dock.’ On iPad though, things work a little differently. The dock is visible on the iPad’s Home Screen, but when working in apps, it tends to stay hidden unless you invoke it. But in iPadOS 26, by enabling the ‘Automatically Show and Hide Dock’ setting, you can keep the dock visible even while working inside apps. Notice that ‘Show’ is emphasized first. All you have to do is make sure the app’s window doesn’t encroach on the dock’s territory. Essentially, you need to follow two rules: The app’s window can’t be full-screen, otherwise the dock will stay hidden Nor can the window in any way occupy the bottom part of the screen where the dock lives Meet these two requirements? Then the dock will stay visible while working in apps. This can make switching between apps easier, and also pairs nicely with the dock’s new ability to hold folders from the Files app. For me, enabling the new setting and resizing my windows so the dock stays visible has made a huge difference. These changes alone have made my iPad feel more like a Mac than ever before. What do you think of the new dock setting in iPadOS 26? Let us know in the comments.

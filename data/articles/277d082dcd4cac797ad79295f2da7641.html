    <pre><code>In brief
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has suggested that prediction markets should be designed to prioritize hedging strategies, and that they’re currently focused too much on short-term crypto bets.
Instead of developing an "ideal stablecoin" pegged to a global price index, Buterin argues that hedging on real-world events, goods and services could enable prediction markets to "get rid of the concept of currency altogether."
Figures in the prediction market industry agree that an emphasis on hedging could help prediction markets function more effectively.
Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has argued that hedging on prediction markets could provide the same kind of price stability as stablecoins, potentially rendering fiat currency unnecessary.In a long tweet, Buterin offered his views on how to make prediction markets more useful, with the Russian-Canadian programmer arguing that, while achieving a “high level” of success, they are currently producing an increasing quantity of “corposlop.”
Recently I have been starting to worry about the state of prediction markets, in their current form. They have achieved a certain level of success: market volume is high enough to make meaningful bets and have a full-time job as a trader, and they often prove useful as a…

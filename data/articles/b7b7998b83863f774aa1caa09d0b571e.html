<h3><span>Amazfit Balance 2: One minute review</span></h3><p>Two years after the original Amazfit Balance was released, Amazfit has now released its follow-up, the Amazfit Balance 2. The new release represents a solid upgrade with a distinct focus on durability, battery life, and enhanced sensors/features. In real terms, that means a bigger battery, superior water resistance, a brighter display, a faster chipset, dual speakers, and sensor upgrades.</p><p>With such fierce competition in the market, we're unlikely to see the Amazfit Balance 2 featuring in our<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/best-smart-watches-what-s-the-best-wearable-tech-for-you-1154074"> best running watches</a> guide, but that doesn't mean it's not worthy of consideration, as evidenced by our four-star rating.</p><p>The single most impressive feature of the watch is the multi-week battery life. With many watch alternatives forcing customers to choose between features and battery life, the Balance 2 delivers a flagship-level experience with remarkable longevity. This means less charging anxiety and better continuous tracking, especially for multi-day trips or long activity periods.</p><p>In terms of software, the addition of Zepp Flow AI is a significant step forward. Watches, for a long while, have supported voice assistants such as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> Alexa, Siri or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/garmin">Garmin</a>’s native voice assistant, but these have required specific rigid commands. Zepp Flow AI, along with the most recent wave of Android watches which now use Gemini on Wear OS 6, understands and responds to conversational, natural speech.</p><p>Despite these upgrades, it’s a long way off the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/apple-watch-ultra-3-review"> Apple Watch Ultra 3</a> or the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2"> Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 </a>as a smartwatch. But it’s not really looking to compete on the same plane. The Balance 2 is a middle-of-the-market smartwatch that is looking to push what is possible for under $300/£300.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SAWvuxf9ya9QYJ9i2TDXoU.jpg" alt="Amazfit Balance 2">

It’s more expensive than the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/amazfit-active-2-review">Amazfit Active 2</a> ($99 / £99.98 / AU$149.99) but not as pricey as the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/garmin-venu-4-review"> Garmin Venu 4</a> ($450 / £450). In terms of features, specs, and price, the Balance 2 is probably most comparable with the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/huawei-watch-gt-5-review-a-gorgeous-looking-mid-range-fitness-tracker"> </a><a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/samsung">Samsung</a> Galaxy Watch8.</p><p>The Balance 2 offers a respectable set of features considering its sub-$300/£300 price tag, but it's not as mature or refined as the Garmin Venu 4. If you care deeply about advanced fitness analysis and reliable structured workouts, then you'll want the more premium Garmin. If, on the other hand, you care little for these more advanced fitness tracking features, then the Balance 2 serves up a reasonable alternative with an equally impressive display and fantastic battery life.</p><p><strong>Value score 4.5/5</strong></p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4fDnbtGAWhhqwsETVL3MLW.jpg" alt="Amazfit Balance 2">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)</span></figcaption></figure><h3><span>Amazfit Balance 2: Design</span></h3><ul><li><strong>Small and lightweight design</strong></li><li><strong>1.5-inch AMOLED display with 2,000 nits brightness</strong></li><li><strong>10 ATM (100-meter) water resistance</strong></li></ul><p>The Balance 2 offers a classic circular watch design. In terms of materials, there’s an aluminum alloy alongside a fiber-reinforced polymer case, and this blend of materials is about as premium as you're going to get at this price point, similar to the Garmin Vivoactive 6. .</p><p>The watch is 47.4mm wide and 12.3mm thick. It also weighs a minimal 42g without the strap. As a result, the Balance 2 sits comfortably without overpowering the wrist muscles or looking unnecessarily bulky. I'm looking at you,<a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/huawei-watch-ultimate-2-review-a-deep-dive-with-the-first-ever-smartwatch-to-feature-sonar-communication"> Huawei Watch Ultimate 2</a>. The orange silicone strap creates a gorgeous contrast with the black case while delivering the added benefits of water resistance, a comfortable feel, and easy cleaning after a sweaty run.</p><p>The Balance 2 boasts a 1.5-inch AMOLED display, which is protected by highly scratch-resistant sapphire glass. This is a significant upgrade over the standard tempered glass of its predecessor and means users don't have to worry while engaging in some activities which might damage the watch. Maybe most impressive is its peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits, which puts it towards the elite end and equal with the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-11-review"> Apple Watch Series 11</a>. As a result, I had no problems using the watch even under direct sunlight, not that there was a huge amount around during winter in the UK.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wW5m4vxecjUpAhbuUJc8FT.jpg" alt="Amazfit Balance 2">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For those engaging in water sports, the Balance 2 offers substantial ruggedness with a 10 ATM (100-meter) water resistance rating. This goes beyond standard swimming and showering, making it suitable for high-speed water sports and even shallow scuba diving, which is an impressive level of durability for a smartwatch positioned outside of the ultra-premium or dedicated dive watch category.</p><p>The watch includes a digital crown for tactile scrolling through menus, although it feels a little on the cheap side. Additionally, dual speakers and a microphone contribute to the design, enhancing the ability to take clear Bluetooth calls and use the Zepp Flow AI voice assistant.</p><p><strong>Design Score: 4/5</strong></p><h3><span>Amazfit Balance 2: Features</span></h3><ul><li><strong>Zepp Flow AI for natural voice controls</strong></li><li><strong>21-day battery life</strong></li><li><strong>Improved sensors and dual-band GPS</strong></li></ul><p>With a middle-of-the-range set of health and fitness tracking features, I was actually more intrigued by the Zepp Flow AI, which offers a natural way to interact with the watch. Through natural language, it is possible to engage the watch, perform health queries, and control activity tracking. I didn't have to memorize a set of predefined commands but could instead treat it like I treat any other AI engine, such as ChatGPT or Gemini.</p><p>Then there's the advertised 21-day battery life that is possible with typical usage. This is an upgrade from 14 days in the original Balance and reduces the need for regular charging. The three-week battery life drops to around 10 days with heavier usage, or if you want to perform continuous GPS tracking, then you'll get 33 hours. For real-world results, I get into battery performance in the next section.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eyTV2LxUTKnse4U6dB6bsU.jpg" alt="Amazfit Balance 2">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of sports and health tracking, the Balance 2 incorporates a newer BioTracker 6.0 PPG optical sensor, which Amazfit claims has a specific benefit on the accuracy of measured heart rate and sleep data. There's also dual-band GPS, which is known for its higher accuracy and improved reliability, especially in challenging environments like cities or dense forests.</p><p>The Balance 2 features 32GB of onboard storage, which is essential for anyone wanting to exercise, navigate routes and listen to locally stored music without needing their phone with them.</p><p><strong>Features Score: 4/5</strong></p><h3><span>Amazfit Balance 2: Performance</span></h3><ul><li><strong>Exceptional battery performance</strong></li><li><strong>Accurate tracking</strong></li><li><strong>Solid and reliable GPS</strong></li></ul><p>Let's begin with one of the best-performing elements of the Balance 2—the battery life. I had no problems achieving the advertised 21 days of battery life when using the device to track the occasional workout alongside regular health checks. When I increased my GPS use and switched over to the Always-On Display, the battery life dropped to just a week, but that’s still very impressive. Whatever your smartwatch habits, the Balance 2 is streets ahead of more powerful watchOS or Wear OS alternatives such as the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple-watch">Apple Watch</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Google Pixel Watch</a>, making it more like Garmin or Coros: a top low-power choice for multi-day hiking, long cycle rides, or more demanding adventures.</p><p>As for charging, the proprietary charging cradle has a USB-C attachment. During testing, I only had to recharge the watch a handful of times, but when I did, I was able to achieve 0 percent to 100 percent in a little under two hours. Faster recharging is available on other smartwatches such as the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/oneplus-watch-3-review-androids-long-lasting-chunky-smartwatch"> OnePlus Watch 3</a>, but Amazfit has opted, instead, for a steadier power delivery to preserve the battery's long-term health.</p><p>In terms of tracking performance, Amazfit has updated the BioTracker from version 5.0 to 6.0 which boasts significant improvements in terms of accuracy, certification, and Zepp OS support. The watch delivered accurate heart rate and blood oxygen readouts with comparison tests run on the demonstrably accurate <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/huawei-watch-ultimate-2-review-a-deep-dive-with-the-first-ever-smartwatch-to-feature-sonar-communication">Huawei Watch Ultimate 2</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the watch features an improved six-satellite GPS system with a new Huangshan 3 chipset and upgraded antenna and signal processing. In real terms, the watch locked onto a strong signal as soon as I moved out of my house and maintained it while tracking through a number of tricky environments, including a built-up city, forest area, and rural areas. To test accuracy, I compared a number of bike rides and runs against onthegomap.com and my benchmark-accurate smartwatch, the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/huawei-watch-ultimate-2-review-a-deep-dive-with-the-first-ever-smartwatch-to-feature-sonar-communication"> </a>Huawei Watch Ultimate 2. I found the Balance 2 to be accurate with very little drifting, even when traveling long distances.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7zFmUNojUEdkZEtVfyAoCU.jpg" alt="Amazfit Balance 2">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future / Paul Hatton)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Map interaction left a lot to be desired, unfortunately. Despite the upgraded chip, the Balance 2 struggled to render high-resolution maps and labels in real time. The presence of a lag meant I quickly lost interest in using the map feature.</p><p>The watch is powered by Zepp OS 5, which is one of the most fluid and responsive <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/operating-system">operating systems</a> I've experienced. I also loved using Zepp Flow, which is the AI-driven voice assistant. With it I was able to perform actions hands-free, including starting and stopping workouts, as well as interact with notifications. This was a big time saver and super handy at times when I couldn’t easily operate the watch’s menus.</p><p>As good as the Balance 2 is for health and fitness tracking, it's seriously let down by its lack of third-party apps such as Spotify, Apple Maps, and Strava. Even Garmin has integration of sorts with apps like Spotify via the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/im-a-garmin-expert-here-are-5-settings-i-change-on-my-garmin-watch-before-i-do-anything-else">Garmin Connect IQ store</a>. This lack of deep ecosystem integration means that the watch remains largely isolated from everything else you might interact with on a daily basis. There's also no LTE/cellular option, which means it's unable to work independently from your phone.</p><p><strong>Performance score: 4/5</strong></p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bg88wMz7hz82kmrioV93VU.jpg" alt="Amazfit Balance 2">

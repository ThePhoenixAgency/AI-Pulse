But recently, it has entered a period of stagnancy. Its overall revenues have been flat to down since the end of 2023, and its  has slumped by more than half in the last few years.</p>   <p>Global unit sales volumes for its electric vehicles have stopped growing. At the same time, the company is trying to pivot its focus to autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, but has struggled to gain much traction in either space. It may be many years before those new business lines have a true impact on Tesla's bottom line.</p>      <p><em><strong>Will AI create the world's first trillionaire?</strong>&nbsp;Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an "Indispensable Monopoly" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need.&nbsp;</em></p>   <p>With this in mind -- and with Tesla's $1 trillion  as of this writing -- investors may be smart to avoid buying the stock right now. Here are two other potential millionaire-maker stocks you may want to consider adding to your portfolio instead.</p>      <p><strong>Remitly Global</strong> <span>(NASDAQ: RELY)</span> has grown impressively over the last few years. Through its mobile application, lower fees, and a better customer experience than is offered by rival services, it has begun to gain market share within the remittance space, which covers international money transfers.</p>   <p>Last quarter, its active customers grew 21% year over year to 8.9 million, revenue grew 25% to $420 million, and the business generated positive net income. Over the next few years, management expects total revenue to about double to $3 billion, with $600 million in adjusted EBTIDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). That level of expected earnings makes its current market cap of $2.85 billion look mighty cheap.</p>       <p>Some investors may shy away from Remitly because of the apparent threat that stablecoins pose to its business model, as, in principle, these cryptocurrencies allow people to more easily send money across borders freely. However, this runs into a speed bump when you have to convert stablecoins into local currencies, a process that always incurs costs. Investors are also wary of how the immigration crackdown in the United States will impact the market for cross-border remittances. The numbers so far don't show that as a cause for concern, however: Remitly's 2025 financials show no impact from stricter U.S. border and immigration policies. Moreover, there are still millions of immigrants in countries around the world who want to send money back home to their families, and that is not going to change anytime soon.</p>  </div></div> <span><section>   <p><span>Opted out of sale / share </span></p>   </section> </span>  </article>      <section><header> </header>  <div><ul> <li><section><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/when-will-mortgage-rates-go-down-to-5-201806162.html"><p><img alt="When will mortgage rates go down below 5%?

  <div class="content"><p>XRP outruns bitcoin, ether after investors piled into the recent crashXRP is outperforming bitcoin and ether following signs of dip buying during recent crash.Updated Feb 15, 2026, 1:59 p.m. Published Feb 15, 2026, 1:39 p.m. Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP$1.4978 is rising faster than bitcoin BTC$68,843.85 and ether ETH$1,978.09 as investors hunt for bargains following a price crash earlier this month.XRP's price has rallied 38% to $1.55 since hitting a low on Feb. 6, according to CoinDesk data. The price has jumped by more than 5% in the past 24 hours alone.STORY CONTINUES BELOWThis performance puts it well ahead of both bitcoin and ether, which have gained roughly 15% since Feb. 6.

XRP rallied sharply from $0.60 to over $2.40 in the final two months of 2024 as the balance held on exchanges slid faster.More For You'We do not do illegal things': Inside a U.S.-sanctioned stablecoin issuer's race to build a crypto giant4 hours agoOleg Ogienko, the public face of A7A5, pitched the ruble-pegged stablecoin as a fast-growing trade rail built to move money across borders despite sanctions pressure.

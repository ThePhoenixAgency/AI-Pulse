CryptoQuant data indicates Binance's XRP reserves dropped by 192.37 million XRP to 2.553 billion between Feb. 7 and 9. The 7% slide marked the lowest level since January 2024, and holdings have remained stable since then.</p><figure><img alt="XRP: exchange reserve on Binance.

The logic is that investors prefer to take direct custody of coins rather than keep them on exchanges when they plan to hold them long-term.</p><p>Sudden, sharp withdrawals can reduce available supply, opening the door to a price rally. Historical trends reinforce this view. XRP rallied sharply from $0.60 to over $2.40 in the final two months of 2024 as the balance held on exchanges slid faster.<br /></p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>Hive, Riot earnings reports, Fed rate-decision minutes: Crypto Week Ahead</p><div><p>57 minutes ago</p></div><figure><img alt="Federal Reserve logo highlighted on a U.S. banknote (joshua-hoehne/Unsplash/Modified by CoinDesk)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2Faa140510763159a9c00f0230ff84f4f675e733d6-1920x1080.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" /></figure><p>Your look at what's coming in the week starting Feb. 16.</p><div><p>What to know: </p><div><p>You are reading Crypto Week Ahead: a comprehensive list of what's coming up in the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain in the coming days, as well as the major macroeconomic events that will influence digital asset markets.

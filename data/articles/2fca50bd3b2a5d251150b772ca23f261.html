Although the overall degree of gloom has lifted slightly since January, consumer confidence continues to run at one of the lowest levels seen over the past two years.</p> <p>A period of prolonged rain and a dearth of sunshine have no doubt not helped to lift the low spirits seen among households, but there’s more going on here than just bad weather. Households are growing increasingly worried about debt in particular, especially as a rising need for credit was met with the steepest decline in availability of loans since August 2024.</p> <p>Households’ appetite for major purchases was impacted by the lack of confidence and debt worries, with sentiment around big ticket expenditure slipping to the lowest in ten months. The low appetite to spend bodes ill for the broader impetus to purchase, hinting at a sustained drag on economic growth from sluggish consumer spending in the first quarter.”</p>

which suggested consumer spending remains sluggish and debts are mounting.</strong></p><p>Consumer confidence in the UK is running at its lowest level in two years, a <a

prospects, and their savings.</p><p>S&amp;P said consumers’ pessimism “matches the dismal weather seen so far this year” and said the <a

households”.</p><p>The UK Consumer Sentiment Index survey, which has been running since 2009, posted a reading of 44.8 in February. Any reading above 50 signals a general improvement in consumer confidence, while anything below suggests a deterioration.</p><p>While this month’s index reading was up slightly from 44.6 in January, it remained among the weakest figures over the past two years.

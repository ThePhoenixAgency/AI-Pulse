<p>Affordable Windows laptops and Chromebooks have dominated the market over the past few years, especially among students. Meanwhile, Apple MacBooks have remained out of reach for many users due to their premium pricing. However, that may be about to change as soon as next month.</p>

<p>We already know that Apple is working on a <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/what-to-expect-from-apples-low-cost-macbook-with-an-iphone-chip/">low-cost MacBook powered by the A18 Pro chip</a>, the same SoC currently found in iPhones. The device has been making headlines since last year, and according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, it might finally hit shelves in March.</p>

<p>Gurman writes in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27">this week’s Power On newsletter</a> that the A18 Pro-powered MacBook could be unveiled sometime in March, as Apple is reportedly planning an event during that month. The device is also expected to cost well under $1,000.</p>

                            
            <p>The new low-cost MacBook is rumored to feature a 12.9-inch display. Interestingly, Mark Gurman says that, despite being an affordable model, Apple does not want to compromise on build quality and will use an aluminum chassis rather than plastic. “To stick with this premium material, Apple developed a new manufacturing process that allows the shells to be forged more quickly,” Gurman said.</p>

<p>Apple aims to position its affordable MacBook for students and enterprise users. As a result, the company is expected to launch the device in “playful colors,” moving beyond the muted tones typically seen on the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. According to Gurman, Apple has been testing colors such as light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray.</p>

<p>However, Apple has yet to announce the pricing, though some sources claim the device could cost around $750.</p>

<p>A low-cost MacBook powered by an iPhone chip could benefit Apple in two major ways. First, it would serve as an entry point for users looking to join the Mac ecosystem without breaking the bank. Second, it would put Apple in a stronger position to compete with affordable Windows laptops and Chromebooks, particularly among students and in emerging markets.</p>

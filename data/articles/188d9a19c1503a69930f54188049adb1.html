    <div><div><p><span>Listen to this article with a </span><span>free account</span></p></div><div><p>President Donald Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/116144552969293195" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Friday</a> that he was banning federal agencies from using the services of AI company Anthropic. </p><p>The declaration comes after months of increasingly heated rhetoric between the Defense Department and Anthropic over the military’s use of the company's systems.</p><p>“I am directing EVERY Federal Agency in the United States Government to IMMEDIATELY CEASE all use of Anthropic’s technology. We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.</p><p>Anthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company, led by CEO Dario Amodei, has made clear in months of contract negotiations with the Pentagon that it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/pentagon-clashes-with-anthropic-over-military-ai-use-2026-01-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would not allow</a> its AI systems to be harnessed for domestic surveillance or direct use in lethal autonomous weapons. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/anthropic-ai-defense-war-venezuela-maduro-rcna259603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pentagon has maintained</a> that it must be allowed to employ its AI systems for “any lawful use,” which may cross some of Anthropic’s red lines.</p><p>“I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies,” <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-department-of-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amodei wrote in a statement</a> Thursday night, but “using these systems for mass domestic surveillance is incompatible with democratic values.” Amodei added that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.”</p><p>In a series of tweets late Thursday night, Undersecretary of Defense Emil Michael <a href="https://x.com/USWREMichael/status/2027211708201058578?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a> that Amodei “is a liar and has a God-complex. He wants nothing more than to try to personally control the US Military and is ok putting our nation’s safety at risk.”</p><p>Earlier Thursday, Pentagon chief spokesperson Sean Parnell <a href="https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/2027072228777734474?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a> that the Pentagon’s desire to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes “is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations.”</p><p>Anthropic <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-and-the-department-of-defense-to-advance-responsible-ai-in-defense-operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently has a contract worth up to $200 million</a> with the Pentagon to “advance responsible AI in defense operations” and <a href="https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2024/Anthropic-and-Palantir-Partner-to-Bring-Claude-AI-Models-to-AWS-for-U.S.-Government-Intelligence-and-Defense-Operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">works with data analytics company Palantir</a> to provide its AI services on classified defense and intelligence networks.</p><p>Throughout Friday, a growing chorus of lawmakers called on the parties to de-escalate their feud and come to an amicable solution, contrasting with the relative silence from Anthropic and the Pentagon in the hours before the deadline.</p><p>In a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_dod_on_ai_vendor_intimidation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made public Friday afternoon</a>, Sens. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said the Pentagon’s “threats to punish an American AI company for refusing to surrender basic safeguards on the use of its AI model represent a chilling abuse of government power.”</p><div><div><img src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/mpx/2704722219/2026_02/1772143355938_now_mtp_clip_anthropicdesantis_260226_1920x1080-sjpz6z.jpg" alt=""></div><div><p><span>08:54</span></p></div></div><p>Rep. George Whitesides, D-Ca., told Hegseth in a letter released Friday morning that he was concerned that his "threats to compel changes to safety policies on an accelerated timeline could push the Department toward broader deployment without sufficient guardrails." </p><p>Unlike many major defense technologies, today’s leading AI systems have been developed primarily in the private sector, by companies like Anthropic, OpenAI and Google. The increasing capabilities of these systems have <a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/24/anthropic-pentagon-claude-hegseth-dario" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forced the Pentagon to bargain with Anthropic</a> over its usage policies or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/23/us/politics/pentagon-anthropic-ai.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opt for a less proven services</a>. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/23/ai-defense-department-deal-musk-xai-grok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Until this week</a>, Anthropic was the only leading AI company that had been cleared to offer services on classified networks.</p><p>In a memo sent to OpenAI employees Thursday evening and viewed by NBC News, CEO Sam Altman said that his company would largely follow Anthropic’s approach if it were in the same position with the Pentagon.</p><p>“We have long believed that AI should not be used for mass surveillance or autonomous lethal weapons, and that humans should remain in the loop for high-stakes automated decisions. These are our main red lines,” he wrote.</p><p>Altman added that “this is no longer just an issue between Anthropic and the DoW; this is an issue for the whole industry and it is important to clarify our stance.”</p><p>It’s unclear how other leading AI companies would respond. Google, Meta and xAI did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>

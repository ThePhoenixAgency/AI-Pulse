  <h1>Palantir moves headquarters to Miami amid tech’s growing retreat to Florida</h1>

    <div><div><p>Palantir <a href="https://x.com/PalantirTech/status/2023780511051809010">announced</a> Tuesday that it has moved its headquarters to Miami from Denver. The data analytics company, criticized for its role in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration’s</a> immigration crackdown, joins a host of other businesses and billionaires that recently moved to Florida in search of a more business-friendly climate.</p><p>Palantir’s move across state lines comes after its chair, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/peter-thiel">Peter Thiel</a>, announced on 31 December that he opened a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-31/thiel-opens-miami-office-as-california-weighs-billionaires-tax">Miami office</a> for his private investment firm. Thiel already has a mansion in Miami Beach. The company, previously headquartered in Palo Alto, announced the move on X but did not provide further details or respond to a request for comment. Palantir’s stay in Colorado lasted about six years; the company exited California in August 2020 – with CEO Alex Karp citing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_9">disagreements</a> with the state’s values.</p><p>Palantir’s Denver office has frequently been the site of <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/08/17/palantir-denver-headquarters-immigration-trump-administration/">protest</a>, as the company faces heated criticism for its involvement in the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/22/ice-palantir-data">push to deport immigrants</a>. Tools and platforms built by Palantir have been used by the federal government in efforts to surveil and detain immigrants. The company has also inked a major contract with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/12/nhs-deal-with-ai-firm-palantir-called-into-question-after-officials-concerns-revealed">UK’s National Health Service</a>.</p><p>Colorado’s immigration and tech activists view Palantir’s departure as a result of their sustained organizing. Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee and organizer for AI regulation in Denver, said that a coalition of unions and grassroots organizations, including Denver Anti-War Action, held a few dozen town halls, strikes and protests that mounted pressure on Palantir’s presence in the city. Pinto also said that Palantir may have been dissuaded by Colorado’s state lawmakers taking the lead on AI regulation with proposals to limit surveillance and discrimination.</p><p>“Colorado has rejected the values of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/palantir">Palantir</a> – the values of an economy built on exploitation of people’s data, whether it’s for warfare or for immigration enforcement,” Pinto said.</p><p>Many of California’s wealthiest billionaires seem to be considering a move to Florida – spooked by the state’s consideration of a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/ca-billionaire-tax-mechanism-21330110.php">billionaire tax</a>. There’s also been a concerted effort by business leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/business/dealbook/florida-ross-griffin-businesses.html">Ken Griffin and Stephen Ross</a> to convince billionaires to move to south Florida and to bring their businesses with them.</p><p>Palantir has tried to distance itself from Trump’s immigration apparatus, but that has not quelled protest. Some of the company’s employees <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-ice-dhs-alex-pretti-killing-workers-slack-minneapolis/">appear to be disturbed</a>, too. Karp recorded a video about Palantir’s involvement with ICE for staff and said they could sign NDAs if they wanted more details, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-employee-questions-on-ice/">Wired</a>.</p><p>James Fishback, a Republican candidate for Florida governor, wrote on X in response to Palantir’s move, saying he would ban Palantir from all government contracts if elected. “You are a threat to our civil liberties,” Fishback wrote. He had vocalized the same position <a href="https://x.com/j_fishback/status/2016167617472454974">last month</a>. Fishback’s commitment comes amid increasing pressure on lawmakers to evaluate their relationship with Palantir. The nationwide campaign <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/01/purge-palantir-donation-tracker-ice-congress/">Purge Palantir</a> has been documenting politicians who received funds from the company’s executives and pressuring them not to accept their donations. The campaign has had some success so far. The Colorado Sun reported that Colorado representative Jason Crow and Colorado senator John Hickenlooper planned to <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2026/02/09/hickenlooper-crow-donate-palantir-funds-immigrant-groups/">donate</a> more than $50,000 each, in campaign contributions from Palantir, to immigrant rights groups.</p><figure></figure><p>Palantir blew past Wall Street <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/02/palantir-financial-results-ice-trump-immigration">expectations</a> for the fourth quarter of 2025 and reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m. Its stock, however, has sunk 20% since the start of 2026.</p></div></div>

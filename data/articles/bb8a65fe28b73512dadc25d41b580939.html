So, given the high-profile coverage, you’re probably the biggest target for potential extortion in prison. So your safety is going to be an issue. So, that’s the thing I was worried about then.”</p>   <blockquote><p>All In interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">@cz_binance</a> the founder of Binance – crypto's biggest company. <a href="https://t.co/mHVFcaOIIY" target="_blank">https://t.co/mHVFcaOIIY</a></p> </blockquote>   <p><strong>Don't Miss:</strong></p>   <ul><li> <p><strong>Professional traders demand transparency —</strong><a href="https://benzingapartners.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=688&amp;aff_id=1" target="_blank"><strong> see why Kraken Pro has become one of crypto's most trusted advanced trading platforms.</strong></a></p> </li><li> <p><strong>The AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — </strong><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/rad-intel-nasdaq-y2?nid=50637660&amp;utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=real_estate&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance" target="_blank"><strong>Invest at $0.85/Share</strong></a></p> </li> </ul>      <p>The former Binance CEO stated he was strip-searched and then sent to his unit in a low-security prison in a California desert.</p>   <p>“I should have been eligible for a minimum security prison, which is one level lower, where most of the white collar crimes go.

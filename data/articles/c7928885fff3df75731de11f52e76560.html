The new “enhanced video podcast experience” will allow users to seamlessly switch between viewing a video podcast and listening to the audio.</p> <h2>A seamless experience for users</h2> <p>The move comes as Apple continues to compete with Spotify, YouTube, and even Netflix for podcast mindshare. Video podcasts with the ability to switch between video and audio seamlessly has become more popular recently.</p> <p>While Apple already supports video podcasts, the technology upgrade coming in iOS 26.4 is built on the company’s HTTP Live Streaming&nbsp;technology.</p> <p>HLS technology allows Apple to offer video playback without compromising the audio podcast listening experience. That’s because HLS tech can power automatic quality adjustment based on network conditions. Users can also download video podcasts for offline playback.</p> <h2>New creator tools for monetization</h2> <p>For creators, Apple shares more details about how the new experience will work:</p> <blockquote>
<p>The new video podcast experience empowers creators. Creators distribute through participating hosting providers and ad networks, maintaining complete control of their content and monetization. Acast, Amazon’s ART19, iHeartMedia’s Triton Digital, and SiriusXM, inclusive of SiriusXM Media, AdsWizz, and Simplecast, are supporting HLS video at launch, with additional providers to join in the future.</p>
</blockquote> <p>As part of the new experience, dynamically inserted video ads will also be supported in Apple’s Podcasts app for the first time.</p> <blockquote>
<p>For the first time, creators can dynamically insert video ads — including host-read spots — unlocking access to the broader video advertising market while maintaining full creative control. Video integrates seamlessly into existing shows without disrupting followers or downloads, and creators can monetize through sponsorships and dynamic advertising.</p>
</blockquote> <p>While Apple doesn’t charge for podcast distribution through its Podcasts app, it does say it will charge ad networks a fee for dynamic ads in HLS video podcast episodes under the new system.</p> <blockquote>
<p>Apple does not charge hosting providers or creators to distribute podcasts on Apple Podcasts, whether via traditional RSS/MP3 or HLS video. Apple will charge participating ad networks a standard impression-based fee for the delivery of dynamic ads in HLS video on Apple Podcasts starting later this year.</p>
</blockquote> <p>Finally, Apple says the upgraded video podcast experience will be available on iPhone, iPad, Apple Vision Pro, and the web.</p> <blockquote>
<p>Podcast hosting providers and podcast creators can learn more about how to enable HLS video on Apple Podcasts, as well as how to use Apple products and tools to capture, produce, and share exceptional video podcast episodes at&nbsp;<a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/">podcasters.apple.com</a>.</p>
</blockquote> <p>iOS 26.4 is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/16/apple-releases-ios-26-4-beta-1-for-iphone/">available</a> as a developer beta starting today.

</figure></div> <div> <p>The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dyson">Dyson</a> PencilWash is a wet cleaner designed specifically for use on hard flooring, and it differs from most of today's <a href="https://www.techradar.com/home/vacuums/best-wet-dry-vacuum-cleaner">best wet-and-dry vacuums</a> in a couple of significant ways. First, it's ridiculously compact and lightweight — the motor and battery have been shrunk down and fitted into the handle, and the water tanks tuck inside the floorhead. Second, it doesn't use suction, but instead harnesses a combination of hydration and agitation to buff away dirt, soak up spills, and generally get your hard floors sparkling.</p><p>It has only just been announced, and is a sister product to the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/home/vacuums/dyson-pencilvac-fluffycones-review">Dyson PencilVac</a>, which is also relatively new to the party. The PencilWash joins the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/home/small-appliances/dyson-washg1-review">WashG1</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/home/vacuums/dyson-clean-wash-hygiene-review">Clean+Wash Hygiene</a> in Dyson's lineup of wet cleaners. So what do we know so far about the Dyson PencilWash? Let's take a look...</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U3cWUM6EPTnA9zaoXufUdJ.jpg" alt="Dyson PencilWash in use">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Dyson)</span></figcaption></figure><h3><span>Dyson PencilWash: price &amp; availability</span></h3><p>The Dyson PencilWash was announced on 19 February 2026. It will go on sale in the UK on 23 February and in the US on 17 March in the US. At list price, it will cost $349 / £299.99 (equivalent to AU$575). I am awaiting information on pricing and availability in Australia, and will update this article when I know more.</p><h3><span>Dyson PencilWash: design</span></h3><p>Let's break the design down into three parts: the handle, the floorhead, and the dock. The handle is 1.5in / 38mm in diameter and contains a shrunk-down motor. The top section of the broom handle is the battery, and it's removable and swappable. On the front of the handle you'll find the control buttons, plus a screen to show you which of the two modes you're in and how much battery you have left.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BnoVurCnTcG8pq8r73VEjJ.jpg" alt="Dyson PencilWash in use">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Dyson)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moving on to the floorhead. This contains two small water tanks — one for clean water, one for dirty — and a microfiber roller that's densely packed with 64,000 filaments per square centimeter. You can use the PencilWash with just water, or mix in some Dyson's-own, non-foaming 02 Probiotic hard floor cleaning solution.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Wc5tBLwEZXhbmt4ardvPJ.jpg" alt="Dyson PencilWash in use">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Dyson)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The roller spins at speed, and is fed evenly with fresh water from eight inlets. The waste water is directed straight into the dirty tank — there's apparently no filter here. (Although Dyson did say that about the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/home/vacuums/dyson-clean-wash-hygiene-review">Clean+Wash Hygiene</a> and it turned out there was one — just the kind built for chunky rather than fine debris.)</p><p>Finally, the dock. This is just for charging the machine, and looks like a little cone. To dock, you remove the mopping floorhead and slot it into the top. There's a drip tray provided to pop the damp floorhead on.</p><h3><span>Dyson PencilWash specs</span></h3><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Cleaner size (H x L x W):</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>10.5 x 7.8 x 45.6in / 26.7 x 19.8 x 115.8cm</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Weight (empty):</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4.9lbs / 2.2kg</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Clean water tank volume:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>0.3L</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Dirty water tank volume:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>0.36L </p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Max runtime:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>30 mins</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Dock features:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Charge only (separate drip tray)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Lie flat height:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>170 degrees, to a height of 15cm</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Floor coverage per tank:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>100m<sup>2</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Charge time:</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>3.5 hours</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h3><span>Dyson PencilWash: usability</span></h3><p>I haven't had any hands-on time with PencilWash yet, so you'll need to sit tight for my full performance review. What I do know is that this cleaner is designed to be very easy to maneuver, and able to glide smoothly into tight spots and around awkward corners. It can lie near-flat to 170 degrees, and in this mode it's just 15cm high.</p><p>It's really very lightweight in general, coming in at 4.9lbs / 2.2kg. Even more notable is that most of the weight is in the floorhead. Dyson says the weight 'in hand', with the PencilVac resting on the floor, will be around 0.8lbs / 0.38kg.</p><p>Dyson says the machine will pivot by just twisting the handle. That's certainly true of the Dyson PencilVac, which is the nimblest vacuum I've ever tested, by some margin. I expect this model to be slightly more cumbersome because the floorhead is (necessarily) chunkier and heavier, but I still have high hopes on the maneuverability front.</p><p>The water tanks are really rather small, so it likely won't be well suited to big homes. A 30-minute runtime is on the shorter side for an appliance like this, but should still allow for a decent amount of cleaning per charge.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/te5WxvB6fSpCE2f5KX6BaJ.jpg" alt="Dyson PencilWash in use">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Dyson)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's very simple in terms of modes and features: there are two moisture modes, and that's about it. Other wet cleaners offer a wider range of modes, and even things like automatic setting adjustment and steam or foam modes — as well as suction, for pulling up solid messes with more oomph. Another common feature that's missing here is a self-clean mode, which would take care of some of the maintenance for you.</p><p>The real USP here, and the reason to choose the PencilWash over competitors' models, is the ultra-compact size. There are some streamlined wet-dry vacuums on the market — the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/home/vacuums/tineco-has-released-a-wet-dry-vacuum-thats-as-nimble-as-a-stick-vac">Tineco FLOOR ONE i7 Fold</a> is a recent example — but as far as I'm aware, there's nothing quite as shrunk-down as the PencilWash available from any other brand.</p><hr>

Guardian Australia’s picture editor Carly Earl explains why the ‘viral’ photo of Mountbatten-Windsor is a masterclass in news photography, and why getting this kind of picture is notoriously difficult.</p><figure><div><figcaption><span></span><span>How the backseat photograph of former prince Andrew was captured – video</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>The Manchester-based photographer told Reuters that he travelled six hours to get to Norfolk when news of Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest broke. After a tipoff, he made his way to Aylsham, about 36 miles from Sandringham, where he waited outside the town’s police station. A few members of the press were there, including two Reuters colleagues.</p><p>After six or seven hours of nothing happening, he decided to call it a day and began heading towards a hotel. Minutes later, however, he got a call from his colleague – Mountbatten-Windsor’s car had arrived at the police station.</p><p>He rushed back in time to see two vehicles leaving at high speed. He took six quick snaps – two showed police, two were blank and one was out of focus. But one captured Mountbatten-Windsor slumped in the back seat of a Range Rover, his hands loosely clasped and a slightly bewildered look on his face.</p><p>“You can plan and use your experience and know roughly what you need to do, but still everything needs to align,” said Noble.</p><p>“When you’re doing car shots it’s more luck than judgment.”</p><figure><div><img alt="Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor pictured sat on the back seat of a car." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07cdb0f1f54035a65a284c06bbb42b0be0b07414/0_0_3445_2244/master/3445.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor leaves Aylsham police station.</span> Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</figcaption></figure></article><article><header><h2>Zack Polanski calls for inquiry into public figures alleged to have committed offences</h2></header><p>Green party leader <strong>Zack Polanski</strong> said there should be <strong>a full statutory inquiry</strong> after the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.</p><p>When asked for his reaction while he was campaigning in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/08/gorton-denton-byelections-battle-labour-green-reform">Gorton, Greater Manchester,</a> he said: “I think it’s pretty awful.

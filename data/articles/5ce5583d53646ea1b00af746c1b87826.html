<p>Apple plans to launch a rebranded Sales Coach app for iPhone and iPad later this month. The new app will replace the existing <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seed/id6449049254">SEED app</a> and continue to support Apple Store and Apple Authorized Reseller employees with sales training and product knowledge. With this move, Apple aims to refresh how its retail teams access internal guidance and learning tools.</p>



<p>The Sales Coach app will still offer articles and videos that explain key product features and upgrade reasons. For example, employees can review why customers should consider upgrading to a newer iPhone or learn about popular iPad features. At the same time, Apple is introducing design and functionality changes to make the experience more modern and interactive.</p>



<p>A source familiar with the matter said Apple is targeting Monday, February 23, for the release. The same source said the app will include two major changes compared to SEED. First, it will feature an all-new Liquid Glass design. Second, a future update will add an AI chatbot that can provide sales tips and product information directly inside the app.</p>



<h2>New Design and AI Chatbot</h2>



<p>The redesigned interface will give Sales Coach a cleaner and more updated look. Apple plans to integrate the chatbot into the Ask tab in a later update. Once available, employees will be able to type product-related questions and receive quick answers. For example, they can ask about the key features of the iPhone Air or how Instant Hotspot works on a Mac.</p>



<p>Apple has not confirmed whether the chatbot runs on its own large language model or uses a third-party platform. However, the goal is clear. The company wants to give retail employees faster access to accurate product knowledge during customer interactions.</p>



<p>Sales Coach will also roll out on the web at <a target="_blank" href="https://salescoach.apple.com/">salescoach.apple.com</a>. It remains an internal tool, which means the public cannot access it.</p>

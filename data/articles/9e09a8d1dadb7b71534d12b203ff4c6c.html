<p>Mark your calendars for <strong>March 27-28, 2026</strong>, as we come together for Arduino Days 2026 – our annual online event for<strong> everyone, everywhere</strong>.</p>



<p>As we step into 2026, we embrace an exciting paradigm shift in technology, ready to explore the new world of AI. For the past two decades, Arduino has been a favorite of makers, educators, and innovators at every level to get started with electronics, Cloud, and IoT. Today, we continue this long heritage in making technology accessible to everyone in the new era of artificial intelligence. We’re also excited that Edge computing is becoming more prevalent, and that the boundaries between prototyping and production are blurring and getting easier to blend. Arduino is evolving right alongside these changes, bringing our deep open-source roots, affordability and ease of use to one of the most exciting eras of our time. </p>



<p>Of course, the past year has been full of milestones for Arduino as a company as well. In October 2025, we joined the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. family, launched the Arduino® UNO™ Q, introduced Arduino App Lab, and strengthened our commitment to making cutting-edge technology open and accessible to everyone. </p>



<p>On March 27th, we will kick off Arduino Days 2026 to celebrate YOU and honor our mission: <strong>push the boundaries of what’s possible, make technology accessible, and continue to build an open platform for innovators worldwide – now in the AI generation.  </strong></p>



<h2>How can you take part in Arduino Days 2026?</h2>



<p><strong>Whether you plan to join a local event, organize one or join us online, you’ll find everything you need on </strong><a href="https://days.arduino.cc/" target="_blank"><strong>days.arduino.cc</strong></a>! Start by bookmarking the page to stay updated as we announce speakers, finalize the schedule, and add new content. On Friday, March 27th and Saturday, March 28th, you’ll be able to watch the live stream right from the site, as well as on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@arduino" target="_blank">our YouTube channel</a>. </p>



<p>This year’s livestream will feature:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Inspiring talks</strong> from experts, community members, and Arduino team members on topics ranging from AI and edge computing to education, robotics, and beyond.</li>



<li><strong>Exciting announcements</strong> about what’s coming next from Arduino.</li>



<li><strong>Community showcases</strong> highlighting the incredible projects you’ve built, because Arduino Days is never about us, it’s about <em>you.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Whether you’re a long-time Arduino user or just discovering what’s possible with accessible technology, there will be something for everyone.</p>



<p>The website is also where you can <strong>find local events organized for Arduino Days</strong>: check it out to join the community IRL!</p>



<h2>Get involved with our calls for speakers and organizers</h2>



<p>Want to take it a step further and make a first-person contribution to Arduino Days 2026? Considering running your own Arduino event? We highly recommend it. We’re looking for passionate community members to make sure Arduino Days 2026 reaches every corner of the world! Here are two ways you can help make this edition an unforgettable moment for yourself and your friends. </p>



<h2>Call for Speakers</h2>



<p>Do you have a project, idea, or experience to share? We want to hear from you! Whether you’re working with AI and machine learning, building robotics projects, creating educational tools, pushing the limits of embedded systems, or exploring something entirely unexpected – your story deserves to be told. <strong>Submit your speaker proposal using the </strong><a href="https://arduinoconnect374011.typeform.com/to/JDwno6D9" target="_blank"><strong>form available at the Arduino Days website</strong></a>. We’ll be accepting proposals through <strong>February 25th</strong>.</p>



<h2>Call for Organizers</h2>



<p>Host a local meetup, workshop, or celebration and join our global network of Arduino Days organizers. We’ll put you on the map (literally!) on the Arduino Days website and provide resources to help make your event a success. Organizers and participants will get exclusive access to UNO Q discounts. <strong>Sign up to organize a local event</strong> <a href="https://days.arduino.cc/events#ORkZ5qb0RseS0mLxG4v3Hw" target="_blank"><strong>at the Arduino Days website</strong></a>. Registration is open now through <strong>March 15th.</strong></p>



<h2>Let’s write the new AI chapter, together</h2>



<p>Arduino Days has always been about community. It’s about the educators teaching the next generation of makers, the hobbyists turning ideas into reality in their garages, the students learning to code for the first time, the engineers prototyping the future, the businesses looking for unconventional ways to boost their productivity, and everyone in between who believes that technology should be open, accessible, and empowering.</p>



<p>This new chapter we’re entering – with advanced AI capabilities, more powerful hardware, and expanded possibilities – is still fundamentally about the same thing: putting powerful tools in your hands and giving you the freedom to create.We’ll be sharing more details about the program, speakers, and special announcements in the coming weeks – so keep an eye here on the Arduino Blog and our social channels for updates. <strong>The future is being written right now – and our proudest achievement is seeing you take the lead in this new story.</strong></p>

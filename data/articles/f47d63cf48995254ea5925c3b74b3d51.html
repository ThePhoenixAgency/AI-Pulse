    <div><div><p>Finance leaders are driving ROI using agentic AI for accounts payable automation, turning manual tasks into autonomous workflows.</p><p>While general AI projects saw return on investment rise to 67 percent last year, autonomous agents delivered an average ROI of 80 percent by handling complex processes without human intervention. This performance gap demands a change in how CIOs allocate automation budgets.</p><p>Agentic AI systems are now advancing the enterprise from theoretical value to hard returns. Unlike generative tools that summarise data or draft text, these agents execute workflows within strict rules and approval thresholds.</p><p>Boardroom pressure drives this pivot. A report by <a href="https://www.basware.com/en/">Basware</a> and FT Longitude finds nearly half of CFOs face demands from leadership to implement AI across their operations. Yet 61 percent of finance leaders admit their organisations rolled out custom-developed AI agents largely as experiments to test capabilities rather than to solve business problems.</p><p>These experiments often fail to pay off. Traditional AI models generate insights or predictions that require human interpretation. Agentic systems close the gap between insight and action by embedding decisions directly into the workflow.</p><p>Jason Kurtz, CEO of Basware, explains that patience for unstructured experimentation is running low. “We’ve reached a tipping point where boards and CEOs are done with AI experiments and expecting real results,” he says. “AI for AI’s sake is a waste.”</p><h3>Accounts payable as the proving ground for agentic AI in finance</h3><p>Finance departments now direct these agents toward high-volume, rules-based environments. Accounts payable (AP) is the primary use case, with 72 percent of finance leaders viewing it as the obvious starting point. The process fits agentic deployment because it involves structured data: invoices enter, require cleaning and compliance checks, and result in a payment booking.</p><p>Teams use agents to automate invoice capture and data entry, a daily task for 20 percent of leaders. Other live deployments include detecting duplicate invoices, identifying fraud, and reducing overpayments. These are not hypothetical applications; they represent tasks where an algorithm functions with high autonomy when parameters are correct.</p><p>Success in this sector relies on data quality. Basware trains its systems on a dataset of more than two billion processed invoices to deliver context-aware predictions. This structured data allows the system to differentiate between legitimate anomalies and errors without human oversight.</p><p>Kevin Kamau, Director of Product Management for Data and AI at Basware, describes AP as a “proving ground” because it combines scale, control, and accountability in a way few other finance processes can.</p><h3>The build versus buy decision matrix</h3><p>Technology leaders must next decide how to procure these capabilities. The term “agent” currently covers everything from simple workflow scripts to complex autonomous systems, which complicates procurement.</p><p>Approaches split by function. In accounts payable, 32 percent of finance leaders prefer agentic AI embedded in existing software, compared to 20 percent who build them in-house. For financial planning and analysis (FP&amp;A), 35 percent opt for self-built solutions versus 29 percent for embedded ones.</p><p>This divergence suggests a pragmatic rule for the C-suite. If the AI improves a process shared across many organisations, such as AP, embedding it via a vendor solution makes sense. If the AI creates a competitive advantage unique to the business, building in-house is the better path. Leaders should buy to accelerate standard processes and build to differentiate.</p><h3>Governance as an enabler of speed</h3><p>Fear of autonomous error slows adoption. Almost half of finance leaders (46%) will not consider deploying an agent without clear governance. This caution is rational; autonomous systems require strict guardrails to operate safely in regulated environments.</p><p>Yet the most successful organisations do not let governance stop deployment. Instead, they use it to scale. These leaders are significantly more likely to use agents for complex tasks like compliance checks (50%) compared to their less confident peers (6%).</p><p>Anssi Ruokonen, Head of Data and AI at Basware, advises treating AI agents like junior colleagues. The system requires trust but should not make large decisions immediately. He suggests testing thoroughly and introducing autonomy slowly, ensuring a human remains in the loop to maintain responsibility.</p><p>Digital workers raise concerns regarding displacement. A third of finance leaders believe job displacement is already happening. Proponents argue agents shift the nature of work rather than eliminating it.</p><p>Automating manual tasks such as information extraction from PDFs frees staff to focus on higher-value activities. The goal is to move from task efficiency to operating leverage, allowing finance teams to manage faster closes and make better liquidity decisions without increasing headcount.</p><p>Organisations that use agentic AI extensively report higher returns. Leaders who deploy agentic AI tools daily for tasks like accounts payable achieve better outcomes than those who limit usage to experimentation. Confidence grows through controlled exposure; successful small-scale deployments lead to broader operational trust and increased ROI.</p><p>Executives must move <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ai-expo-2026-day-2-moving-experimental-pilots-ai-production/">beyond unguided experimentation</a> to replicate the success of early adopters. Data shows that 71 percent of finance teams with weak returns acted under pressure without clear direction, compared to only 13 percent of teams achieving strong ROI.</p><p>Success requires embedding AI directly into workflows and governing agents with the discipline applied to human employees. “Agentic AI can deliver transformational results, but only when it is deployed with purpose and discipline,” concludes Kurtz.</p><p><strong>See also: </strong><a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/financial-services-ai-deployment-singapore/"><strong>AI deployment in financial services hits an inflection point as Singapore leads the shift to production</strong></a></p><figure><a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series"><img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3.png" alt="Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events." /></a></figure><p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

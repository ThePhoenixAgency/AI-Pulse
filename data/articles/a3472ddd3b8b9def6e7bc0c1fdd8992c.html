Failing to do so risks a wider regional conflict with grave consequences for civilians and regional stability."</p></div><div><p>An emergency UN Security Council meeting has been called for later on Saturday.</p></div><div><p>"Active and serious negotiations have yet again been undermined," he wrote on X, telling the US that the strikes don't serve their interests or that of global peace. "I urge the United States not to get sucked in further. This is not your war."</p></div><div><p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi blasted the joint US and Israel strikes as "wholly unprovoked, illegal, and illegitimate".</p></div><div><p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/araghchi/status/2027724061892043214" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X</a> he said that Trump has turned "America First into Israel First - which always means America Last".</p></div><div><p>A joint statement by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and<b> </b>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also urged Iran to "seek a negotiated solution".</p></div><div><p>The statement, <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/GermanEmbassy/status/2027742802260467832" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X</a> by the German Embassy in London, said the countries had consistently urged the Iranian regime to end its nuclear and missile programs, refrain from "destabilising activity", and to stop the "appalling violence and repression against its own people".</p></div><div><p>"We did not participate in these strikes," the three leaders said, adding they are in contact with international partners, including the US, Israel and others in the region.</p></div><div><p>"We urge the Iranian leadership to seek a negotiated solution. Ultimately, the Iranian people must be allowed to determine their future," they said.</p></div><div><p>Saudi Arabia also condemned the retaliatory attacks on Bahrain, the UAE, Qatar, Jordan and Kuwait as it denounced in the "strongest terms blatant Iranian aggression".</p></div><div><p>"The Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] affirms its full solidarity with and unwavering support for the brotherly countries, and its readiness to place all its capabilities at their disposal in support of any measures they may undertake," the foreign ministry said in a statement.</p></div><div><p>Russia condemned the US-Israeli strikes on Iran, saying it was a "reckless move".</p></div><div><p>"The attacks are once again being carried out under the guise of a renewed negotiation process," its foreign ministry said, referring to the US-Iran nuclear talks which took place last week.</p></div><div><p>The Kremlin's statement also called on the international community to assess what it called "irresponsible actions aimed at undermining peace, stability, and security" in the region.</p></div><div><p>Although the UK said it was not involved in the US-Israeli strikes, Sir Keir says British planes "are in the sky today" in the Middle East as part of "co-ordinated regional defensive operations to protect our people, our interests and our allies".</p></div><div><p>Previously, Macron said the "outbreak" carries "grave consequences for international peace and security", and warned that ongoing escalation is "dangerous for all".</p></div><div><p>"France also stands ready to deploy the necessary resources to protect its closest partners at their request," he added.</p></div><div><p>Macron's statement also called for an "urgent" United Nations (UN) Security Council meeting.</p></div><div><p>Germany said it was informed of the attack in advance, and that Chancellor Merz consulted with relevant security ministers.</p></div><div><p>Kaja Kallas, the European Union's (EU) top diplomat, called the latest developments "perilous".</p></div><div><p>"The EU has adopted strong sanctions against Iran and supported diplomatic solutions, including on the nuclear issue," she said in a statement on X, adding she has spoken to Israel's and other regional foreign ministers.</p></div><div><p>"Protection of civilians and international humanitarian law is a priority."</p></div><div><p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said it would be consulting allies and regional leaders to support efforts to ease tensions.</p></div><div><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his country backed the US "acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent Iran continuing to threaten international peace and security".</p></div><div><p>UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk called for restraint and urged all parties "to see reason, to de-escalate, and for a return to the 'negotiating table'".</p></div><div><p>"As always, in any armed conflict, it is civilians who end up paying the ultimate price," he said, before reminding those involved that protecting civilians is "paramount" under international law.</p></div><div><p>Earlier on Saturday, Trump posted a lengthy video on his Truth Social website, confirming US involvement:</p></div><div><p>"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime," he said, adding that Washington's aim is to "ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon".</p></div><div><p>He also told the Iranian people to remain in shelter and not leave their homes.</p></div><div><p>"When we are finished, take over your government," he said. "It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations."</p></div><div><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu similarly called on all Iranian people "to throw off the yoke of tyranny and bring about a free and peaceful Iran".</p></div><div><p>Thanking Trump, he reiterated his message that Iran "must not be armed with nuclear weapons that would allow it to threaten all of humanity".</p></div><div><p>"Our joint action will create the conditions for the courageous Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands."</p></div></article></div></div>

This is not to say that pressure relief was absent in testing, but it was minimal compared to that of firmer hybrid mattresses I’ve tested such as the <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/dreamcloud-hybrid-mattress/" target="_blank">DreamCloud Hybrid</a> or the <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/wolf-hybrid-mattress/" target="_blank">Wolf Memory Foam Hybrid Premium Firm</a>. Which brings me to firmness: By my measure, this was not a “medium” mattress. Saatva rates this mattress between 5 and 7 on the firmness scale, so it falls in the medium-firm range. Unless you’re more than 200 pounds or have a taller build, your body mass would lead to more sinkage. This felt like a true firm mattress, which I’d rate at 7.5 to 8 out of 10. For context, the firmer hybrid mattresses we’ve tested, like the <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-mattresses/#698a51333a65e5f7878d2996" target="_blank">Plank Firm Luxe</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-mattresses/#654ba0b5e11817fb40712755" target="_blank">Bear Elite Hybrid</a>, reside in the 8 to 10 range of the firmness scale.</p><p>To be clear, a firm mattress is not at all a bad thing. The light cushioning for my pressure points, especially my hips, was right on target for back and <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-mattress-for-stomach-sleepers/" target="_blank">stomach sleepers</a>. Paired with how much spinal alignment support you get from this mattress, this is an <em>excellent</em> choice for these two sleeping positions. Side sleepers, I’m much more hesitant. In my two-week testing period, I also tried this mattress with <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-mattress-toppers/#672d3a2e98cd90e391636ae7" target="_blank">Saatva’s Graphite Memory Foam Topper,</a> which was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/saatvas-winter-olympic-sleep-bundle/" target="_blank">included in the Winter Bundle</a>. That helped significantly to create more cushion to sink into. The downside is that it’s not included with the mattress and costs extra. Athletes will have this available to them in Colorado Springs, but I can’t help but wonder whether, for LA28, it might have been more strategic to go with the Saatva Classic mattress, with its three customizable firmness levels and two heights. However, I can’t even begin to contemplate the logistical headache that would be; I am just a humble mattress tester.</p><p>The Saatva Memory Foam Hybrid did well at maintaining a bouncy feel that supported me as I moved between sleeping positions. It also maintained good motion isolation, keeping the bed stable so my husband wasn’t disturbed on his side as I tossed and turned. I wouldn’t label this a cooling mattress, even with the graphite-infused topper. It stayed more temperature-neutral, not amassing excessive body heat, but it didn't offer a cool-to-the-touch feel either.</p><h2>Personal Record</h2><figure><p><span><img alt="Image may contain Furniture Adult Person Mattress Bed Face and Head" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/6992754258fe40b83797b2a8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Saatva%2520Memory%2520Foam%2520Hybrid%2520Testing%25201%2520%25E2%2580%2594%2520Julia%2520Forbes.png" /></span></p><p><span>Photograph: Julia Forbes</span></p></figure><p>Overall, this is a high-quality offering from Saatva, and based on my testing history with the brand, I expected nothing less. It also comes with Saatva’s free white-glove delivery service, which includes delivery, mattress setup, and haul-away of your old mattress. As someone who hauls around beds every single week, this being part of your purchase is a very big deal. Throw in a 365-night sleep trial with no minimal “break-in” period, plus a lifetime warranty that Saatva offers, and you’ll probably start to understand why I’ve always regarded this brand as one of the best in the game—they know what they are doing.</p></div></div>

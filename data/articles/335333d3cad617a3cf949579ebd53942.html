<p>A critical vulnerability in the WPvivid Backup &amp; Migration plugin for WordPress, installed on more than 900,000 websites, can be exploited to achieve remote code execution by uploading arbitrary files without authentication.</p>


<p>The security issue is tracked as CVE-2026-1357 and received a severity score of 9.8. It impacts all versions of the plugin up to 0.9.123 and could lead to a complete website takeover.</p>


<p>Despite the severity of the issue, researchers at WordPress security company Defiant say that only sites with the non-default “receive backup from another site” option  enabled are critically impacted.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wiz.io/lp/gitlab-security-best-practices-cheat-sheet?utm_source=bleepingcomputer&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=FY26Q4_INB_FORM_GitLab-Security-Best-Practices-Cheat-Sheet&amp;sfcid=701Vh00000Wn1rmIAB&amp;utm_term=FY27-bleepingcomputer-article-970x250&amp;utm_content=GitLab-Best-Practices" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/c/w/GitLab-970x250.png" alt="Wiz" /></a>
</p>


<p>Furthermore, attackers have a 24-hour exploitation window, which is the validity of the generated key required by other sites to send backup files.</p>


<p>This requirement limits realistic exposure; however, the plugin is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpvivid-backuprestore/#description" target="_blank">commonly used</a> for site migrations and backup transfers between hosts, so website administrators are very likely to enable this feature at some point, at least temporarily.</p>


<p>Researcher Lucas Montes (NiRoX) reported the vulnerability to Defiant on January 12. The root cause is the improper error handling in RSA decryption, combined with a lack of path sanitization.</p>


<p>Specifically, when the ‘<em>openssl_private_decrypt()</em>’ function fails, the plugin does not halt execution and instead passes the failed result (false) to the AES (Rijndael) routine.</p>


<p>The cryptographic library treats this as a string of null bytes, creating a predictable encryption key that an attacker can use to craft malicious payloads that the plugin would accept.</p>


<p>Additionally, the plugin failed to properly sanitize uploaded file names, allowing directory traversal. This allows writing files outside the intended backup directory and uploading malicious PHP files for remote code execution.</p>


<p>Defiant notified the vendor, WPVividPlugins, on January 22, following validation of the provided proof-of-concept exploit. A security update addressing <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-1357" target="_blank">CVE-2026-1357</a> was released in version 0.9.124 on January 28.</p>


<p>The fix includes adding a check to stop execution if RSA decryption fails, adding filename sanitization, and restricting uploads to allowed backup file types only, such as ZIP, GZ, TAR, and SQL.</p>


<p>Users of the WPvivid Backup &amp; Migration WordPress plugin should be aware of the risks associated with the vulnerability and upgrade to version 0.9.124 as soon as possible.</p>

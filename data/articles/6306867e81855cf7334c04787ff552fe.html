  <h1>Reform-run council says free library scheme for refugees ‘is not value for money’</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>Reform UK has been criticised for withdrawing all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/lancashire">Lancashire</a> libraries from a scheme supporting refugees because it was not value for money – despite being free.</p><p>Nigel Farage’s party said the region’s 63 libraries would no longer be part of the UK-wide <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/libraries">Libraries</a> of Sanctuary programme because it was not “an appropriate use of taxpayers’ money”.</p><p>However, the charity that runs the programme, City of Sanctuary UK, said the scheme was “completely free”.</p><p>Libraries are often one of the first places refugees and asylum seekers go for support because they offer free access to wifi, computers, language learning resources and books in native languages.</p><figure></figure><p>The Libraries of Sanctuary scheme helps new arrivals with integration by offering tailored support such as English for Speakers of Other Language (Esol) classes, children’s activities and help accessing other public services.</p><p>Lancashire county council, which has been led by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Reform UK</a> since May 2025, previously said its Library of Sanctuary status was recognition that it “aim[s] to foster a culture of welcome and inclusivity”.</p><p>Matthew Salter, the Reform councillor who took the decision, <a href="https://lancashire.thelead.uk/p/reform-uk-lancashire-county-council-libraries-of-sanctuary-scheme-withdraw-refugees-immigration">told the Lancashire Lead</a>: “The Libraries of Sanctuary accreditation reached the end of its agreed term in 2025 and I took the decision to end our participation at that point.</p><p>“The scheme is voluntary, and I do not believe it represents an appropriate use of taxpayers’ money. Our libraries serve all the residents of Lancashire.”</p><p>The move, which appears to have taken fellow councillors by surprise, was sharply criticised by other parties.</p><p>“Mean-spirited is an understatement,” said David Whipp, a Liberal Democrat county councillor. “It’s a vicious attack on some of the most marginalised people and no doubt driven by Reform’s xenophobic tendencies.</p><p>“I would urge them to reconsider and like in the Wizard of Oz try and find some heart.”</p><figure></figure><p>A City of Sanctuary UK spokesperson said: “We are disappointed that Lancashire county council has chosen not to renew its Library of Sanctuary award.</p><p>“Achieved in 2023, this accreditation recognised Lancashire’s libraries as welcoming, inclusive spaces for everyone in the community. The Libraries of Sanctuary network is free to join and simply helps library staff do their jobs better – sharing knowledge, resources and best practice across the UK.”</p><p>Reform says it needs to find £103m of cuts in Lancashire. Last month, local leaders <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/jan/22/reform-councillors-say-they-will-not-close-lancashire-care-homes">reversed their plan</a> to sell off five council-run care homes to save £4m a year after a public outcry.</p><p>Salter said that although subscribing to the libraries scheme “does not have a cost” there was “an implied cost” as a result of “choosing to gear your offer around a particular set of service users, with dedicated time and resources for putting on events and focussing on refugees at the expense of wider service users”. He added: “In Lancashire we focus on the needs of our residents.”</p><p>Stephen Atkinson, the Reform leader of Lancashire county council, said in January the group was on track “to make £65m worth of savings and efficiencies”, however the Conservatives have claimed it began some of these initiatives before it lost power in May 2025.</p><p>Atkinson has defended plans to increase council tax by 3.8% despite previously pledging to “cut waste and reduce taxes”. He said “some branch people” may have made comments about council tax freezes but that “officially, from the party, that was never the position”.</p></div></div>

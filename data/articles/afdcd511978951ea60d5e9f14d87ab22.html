    <div><div><p>The US CLARITY Act, a highly anticipated bill aimed at providing greater clarity for the US crypto industry, could make it through Congress in just over a month, according to crypto-friendly US Senator Bernie Moreno. </p><p>“Hopefully by April,” Moreno<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FC-D3Jimw" target="_blank"> told</a> CNBC during an interview at US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida on Wednesday.</p><p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong joined Moreno for the interview, explaining that they were with representatives from the crypto, banking and US Congress at the World Liberty Financial (WLF) crypto forum to reach a solution on market structure.</p><h2>“A path forward” is in sight, says Moreno</h2><p>“One of the big issues that did come up in the past was this idea of stablecoins on rewards,” Armstrong said. The banking industry previously raised concerns that offering stablecoin yields could undermine traditional banking and shift deposits and interest away from banks.</p><p>While Armstrong had issues with the draft bill and withdrew his support for the CLARITY Act in January, he said there is “now a path forward, where we can get a win-win-win outcome here.”</p><figure> <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7430-4dd5-79d2-9846-2e4f7131109a.png"><figcaption><em>Brian Armstrong and Bernie Moreno joined CNBC on Wednesday. Source: </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8FC-D3Jimw" target="_blank"><em>CNBC</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>“A win for the crypto industry, a win for the banks, and a win for the American consumer to get President Trump’s crypto agenda through to the finish line, so we can make America the crypto capital of the world,” Armstrong said.&nbsp;</p><p>Armstrong said the crypto exchange previously couldn’t support the bill because it includes provisions that ban interest-bearing stablecoins and position the US Securities and Exchange Commission as the primary regulator of the crypto industry. The White House was reportedly disappointed by Coinbase’s decision to withdraw its support,<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/white-house-considers-dropping-crypto-bill-after-coinbase-withdrawal"> describing the move</a> as a “unilateral” action that blindsided administration officials.</p><p>Moreno admitted that the delay stems from “getting hung up” on the stablecoin rewards, which he said “shouldn’t be part of this equation.”</p><p>Crypto prediction platform Polymarket’s<a href="https://polymarket.com/event/clarity-act-signed-into-law-in-2026" target="_blank"> odds</a> of the US CLARITY Act passing in 2026 briefly surged to 90% on Wednesday before falling to 72% at the time of publication.</p><h2>Moreno shuts down idea of a Democrat-led midterm election</h2><p>Meanwhile, Moreno dismissed the idea that a Democratic takeover of Congress could threaten the bill when asked. “The House isn’t going to go Democrat, and neither is the Senate,” Moreno said.</p><p>“The American people are sick and tired of open borders; that is why we got elected. They were sick and tired of high inflation, and they were sick and tired of an out-of-control government,” he added.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Related:</strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ecb-digital-euro-pilot-2027-psp-selection-2026-cipollone"><em><strong> ECB targets 2027 digital euro pilot as provider selection begins in Q1 2026</strong></em></a></p><p>On Dec. 19, White House crypto and AI czar David Sacks<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/white-house-david-sacks-crypto-clarity-act-senate-january"> voiced strong confidence</a> that the bill would pass early this year.</p><p>“We are closer than ever to passing the landmark crypto market structure legislation that President Trump has called for. We look forward to finishing the job in January,” Sacks said at the time.</p><p><em><strong>Magazine:</strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-7-years-upgrade-post-quantum-bip-360-co-author/"><em><strong> Bitcoin may take 7 years to upgrade to post-quantum: BIP-360 co-author</strong></em></a></p></div><p>Cointelegraph is committed to independent, transparent journalism.

<li>The CFTC added senior executives from crypto, finance, and trading firms to its Innovation Advisory Committee.</li>
<li>While the delineation over who regulates spot and derivatives markets in crypto has largely been settled, lawmakers remain divided over the CLARITY Act’s treatment of stablecoins.</li>
<li>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has joined the panel, weeks after withdrawing support for the Senate bill due to concerns over regulatory balance.</li>
</ul></div><p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday named dozens of senior crypto executives to its Innovation Advisory Committee, pulling much of the digital-asset industry into its advisory orbit as Congress continues to grapple with unresolved questions in U.S. crypto regulation.</p><p><span>The committee includes executives from Coinbase, Uniswap Labs, Ripple, Kraken, Robinhood, CME Group, and Nasdaq, among others, in an unusually concentrated show of industry participation for an agency that currently regulates crypto derivatives but not spot trading.</span></p><p>Established <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9167-26" target="_blank">last month</a>, the committee aims to provide the regulator with expertise and recommendations on innovation in financial markets.</p><p><span>CFTC Chairman Michael S. Selig said in a </span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9182-26" target="_blank"><span>statement</span></a> on Thursday<span>&nbsp;that the panel would help the agency “future-proof its markets” and develop clearer rules as technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence reshape the financial landscape.</span></p><p><span>“By bringing together participants from every corner of the marketplace, the IAC will be a major asset for the Commission as we work to modernize our rules and regulations for the innovations of today and tomorrow,” Selig said.</span></p><p><span>It comes as lawmakers in Congress continue to debate the nuances of the CLARITY Act, which seeks to regulate the U.S. crypto market by defining when digital assets fall under securities or commodities oversight.</span></p><p><span>Specifically, the bill aims to clarify the delineation between the CFTC’s oversight of digital commodities and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s authority over securities-like tokens.</span></p><p><span>While that division has largely been accepted across party lines, lawmakers and industry participants remain divided over how the legislation treats stablecoins, particularly whether crypto companies should be permitted to offer yield on dollar-pegged tokens.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It's an issue that has drawn sustained pressure from the banking industry and emerged as the bill’s most contentious provision.</span></p><p><span>Even as those disagreements persist, the CFTC has welcomed the addition of Coinbase's CEO, Brian Armstrong, to its committee. </span></p><p><span>Weeks earlier, Armstrong </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/354668/coinbase-pulls-support-crypto-market-structure-bill-senate-vote" target="_blank"><span>pulled support</span></a><span> for the CLARITY Act, citing concerns over banking lobby-driven limits on stablecoin rewards.</span></p><p><span>The move complicated the bill’s path in the Senate, with Armstrong arguing the draft contained “</span><a href="https://x.com/brian_armstrong/status/2011545247105355865?s=20" target="_blank"><span>too many issues</span></a><span>,” including provisions that could restrict tokenized products, constrain DeFi, and limit stablecoin rewards, rather than market-structure jurisdiction.</span></p><p><span>Armstrong also warned the legislation would erode the CFTC’s authority, arguing it risked “stifling innovation” by making the agency “subservient to the SEC.”</span></p><div><h3>Daily Debrief Newsletter</h3><p>Start every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.</p></div></div></div>

    <div><div><p>The family of an Aboriginal man fatally run down before the driver bragged about his death are angry and heartbroken after their brother’s killer has again avoided jail on appeal.</p><p>In June 2024, Jake Danby hit two Aboriginal men with his car on a Darwin street, killing one and injuring the other.</p><p>He was handed a 12-month community corrections order, with five months in home detention.</p><figure></figure><p>Following public uproar, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory">Northern Territory</a> Director of Public Prosecutions appealed the sentence as “manifestly inadequate”.</p><p>On Friday, Danby’s home detention was increased from five months to two years, as three court of criminal appeal judges upheld the application.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p><p>Delivering their decision in Darwin, chief justice Michael Grant said Danby would also be required to wear an electronic monitoring device.</p><p>But the family of the victim, known as Whitehurst for cultural reasons, have expressed their anger and sadness over the latest punishment.</p><p>“I have a lot of questions, but right now, my heart is just broken,” Toni Whitehurst said.</p><p>“I’m strong but I got upset when I was told the new sentence. It’s not fair, he [Danby] is still out there, there is no justice.”</p><p>It emerged in his earlier court case that the 24-year-old driver had bragged in text messages that the man he killed was an “oxygen thief” and he would not go to jail.</p><p>He called it a “two for one combo” and texted it was “pretty funny watching them roll around on the road after going over my bonnet”.</p><p>Whitehurst said those words continue to hurt the grieving family, as she rubbished the new punishment.</p><p>Prosecutors argued on appeal on 11 December that the text messages elevated Danby’s crime to the aggravated level.</p><p>Prosecutor Pat Williams said a jail term of more than two years was required given the seriousness of the offending and public expectations.</p><p>But defence counsel Jon Tippett said the sentencing judge had taken note of Danby’s text messages and while being appalled by them gave them appropriate weight.</p><figure></figure><p>Supreme court justice Sonia Brownhill had given his client a chance of rehabilitation and counselling and he was abiding by his corrections order amid public condemnation of his actions, the defence said.</p><p>“The renunciation in this case has been a tarring and feathering by the community,” Tippett said.</p><p>“Courts shouldn’t sentence people on the basis of their stupidity or vile comments.”</p><p>Whitehurst’s nephews often ask where their uncle is and remember him as a funny, humble and kind man.</p><p>“They miss him,” Whitehurst said.</p><p>Danby was not in court on Friday and Tippett declined to comment on the revised sentence outside court.</p><p>NT attorney general, Marie-Clare Boothby, has come under fire over the Danby case, accused of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/21/northern-territory-attorney-general-confirms-hit-run-driver-family-link">not reporting a conflict of interest</a> after it emerged he was her sister’s stepson.</p><p>Boothby said she never attempted to hide the fact Danby was an extended family member and at no time was she or her office involved in the criminal matter.</p><figure></figure></div></div>

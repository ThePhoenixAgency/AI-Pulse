<p>Apple has slowly increased battery sizes in recent iPhones. The eSIM version of the iPhone 17 Pro Max now packs a 5,088mAh cell, and reports suggest the iPhone 18 Pro Max will go even higher. For years, many believed Apple faced internal space limits that prevented larger batteries. A recent battery swap on the iPhone 11 Pro challenges that assumption.</p>

<p>A technician replaced the original 3,046mAh battery inside the iPhone 11 Pro with a massive 12,000mAh unit. The surprising part is that the upgraded battery appears to match the physical dimensions of the original cell. That detail suggests there were no space compatibility issues inside the nearly seven-year-old device. The battery health on the test unit had dropped to 67 percent before the replacement.</p>

<p>The YouTube channel <em>The Fix</em> <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/-23OIvIx1U4">documented</a> the entire process. The video shows a straightforward disassembly and installation. The creator noted that the new battery showed no visible size difference compared to the old one. This has led to speculation that the replacement uses silicon carbon battery technology, which offers higher energy density without increasing size.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the device reports a rated capacity of 10,000mAh instead of the advertised 12,000mAh. Even then, that marks more than a 300 percent increase over the original battery. The installation process appeared clean, and the battery fit securely inside the chassis.</p>

<p>Apple does not recommend using unofficial or third-party batteries from unauthorized manufacturers. At the same time, several Chinese smartphone brands have already adopted high density battery technologies in recent years. This raises a broader question. Has Apple deliberately kept battery sizes conservative to maintain supply chain stability and reduce safety risks?</p>

<p>Given Apple’s production scale, the company likely prioritizes consistency and safety over maximum capacity. Critics may question the strategy, but Apple would rather face complaints about smaller batteries than deal with overheating or fire risks.</p>

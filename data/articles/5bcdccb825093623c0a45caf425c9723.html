"Not a transition with hidden interests, influence-peddling, secret meetings and hooded figures. We don't want that sort of transition."</p></div><div><p>Pressure had been mounting for Jerí to resign in the wake of the scandals as he faced a corruption investigation launched by the attorney general and his approval ratings plummeted.</p></div><div><p>His removal marks another chapter of instability for Peru, which is due to hold a general election in April, after which power will be transferred to a new president.</p></div><div><p>Less than a week after Jerí assumed power, protests organised by young Peruvians demanding the political class to do more to combat crime and corruption left one dead and more than 100 people injured.</p></div><div><p><i>Correction 18 February: An earlier version of this article said José Jerí had been impeached as Peru's president. This was later updated to say he had been ousted by Congress to better reflect the parliamentary procedure used to remove him from office.</i></p></div></article></div></div>

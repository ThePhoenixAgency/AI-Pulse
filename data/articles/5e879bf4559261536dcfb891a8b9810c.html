KDE's <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Plasma+6.6">Plasma 6.6</a> desktop release is due out next week (17 February) and there's been some last minute fixes to land. Additionally, KDE Plasma developers continue to be quite active in already landing feature work for Plasma 6.7.
</p><p>
This Week in Plasma is out with its newest issue for highlighting all of the interesting Plasma developments. This week in the lead-up to Plasma 6.6 there have been some last minute changes and fixes while the majority of the interesting work is now queuing up for Plasma 6.7.
</p><p>
Highlights this week include:
</p><p>
- Plasma 6.6's KWin is more hardened against crashes when the graphics driver unexpectedly resets.
</p><p>
- Plasma 6.6 is also fixing a case where Plasma could crash with the i3 tiling window manager.
</p><p>
- Plasma 6.6 is unifying the appearance of HDR content in full-screen windows and windowed windows.
</p><p>
- KSystemStats in Plasma 6.6 will now support GPU temperature monitoring on secondary GPUs.
</p><p>
- Plasma 6.6 is also now allowing support for setting custom  modes for virtual screens.
</p><p>
- Plasma 6.7 is improving loop dvice handling for the Disks &amp; Devices widget.
</p><p>
- Plasma 6.7 is improving the appearance of different dialogs created by KWin. Details on that can be found in a <a href="https://blog.broulik.de/2026/02/nifty-dialogs/">separate blog post</a>.

<p>- KDE Gear 26.04 is improving the process of creating Samba shares for easier file sharing with Windows users or other Linux PCs. The KDE Gear update will now turn on the Samba service for systemd-based distributions as needed. The hope is to make Samba sharing relatively painless.

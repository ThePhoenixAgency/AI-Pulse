    <div><div><p>An amateur mountaineer has been found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter over the death of his girlfriend, whom he left behind on Austria’s highest peak after they got into difficulty on their climb.</p><p>Thomas P, 37, was handed a five-month suspended sentence and fined €9,400 (£8,200) for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/18/climber-manslaughter-charge-girlfriend-austria-highest-peak">causing the death of Kerstin G in January 2025 by gross negligence</a>, an offence that carries a maximum prison term of three years.</p><figure></figure><p>The one-day hearing at a court in Innsbruck, western Austria, drew worldwide attention from the mountaineering community in an extremely rare case of a prosecution over a climbing incident.</p><p>Experts say the ruling sets a precedent that could influence international standards for liability in mountain sports.</p><p>Thomas P had pleaded not guilty and told the court he was “endlessly sorry” for his girlfriend’s death. His lawyer described the incident as a “tragic accident”.</p><p>The court heard that after a gruelling day of climbing in freezing conditions, during which the pair had fallen well behind schedule, the 33-year-old woman was exhausted and lacking the strength to continue. They were about 50 metres below the summit of the Großglockner mountain when night fell.</p><figure><div><img alt="Webcam footage shows a clear image of the boyfriend with a torch descending from the peak in stormy conditions in the early hours of 19 January 2025." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc3bf638a3b6dd2c880ca522b3873a9a5c322b47/0_0_976_548/master/976.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Webcam footage shows Thomas P with a torch descending from the peak in stormy conditions in the early hours of 19 January 2025.</span> Photograph: www.foto-webcam.eu</figcaption></figure><p>Thomas P said the situation had been “very stressful”.</p><p>He admitted leaving Kerstin G on a ridge exposed to strong winds when he had went to seek help. He told the court he could not explain why he had failed to wrap her in the emergency blanket she was carrying or place her in a bivouac bag. When her body was later recovered, the items were found in her rucksack.</p><p>An ex-girlfriend, called as a witness, testified that she had also climbed the Großglockner with Thomas P in 2023. She said he had abandoned her on the route at night after her head torch ran out of battery, leaving her distressed.</p><p>The court was shown webcam footage of Thomas P and Kerstin G ascending the mountain, as well as Thomas P descending alone. The beam of his torch lit up bright against the snowy mountainside.</p><p>The presiding judge, Norbert Hofer, an experienced mountaineer, ruled that the defendant had been negligent in failing to recognise that Kerstin G would be unable to complete the climb well before the two ran into difficulty.</p><p>“I do not see you as a murderer. I do not see you as cold-hearted,” he told Thomas P while delivering the verdict, accepting that he had gone to fetch help.</p><p>However, he said that because the defendant was “galaxies” more proficient as a mountaineer than his girlfriend, and because she had placed herself in his care, he was bore responsibility for her death.</p></div></div>

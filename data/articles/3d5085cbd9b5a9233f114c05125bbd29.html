Use this mortgage calculator to see how your mortgage amount, rate, and term length will impact your monthly payments:</p>        <p>You can bookmark the Yahoo Finance<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/calculators/mortgage-calculator"> mortgage payment calculator</a> and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.</p>      <p>A mortgage interest rate is a fee for borrowing money from your lender, expressed as a percentage. You can choose from two types of rates: fixed or adjustable.</p>   <p>A fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you obtain a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30-year term unless you refinance or sell.</p>   <p>An <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/adjustable-rate-mortgage-155738644.html">adjustable-rate mortgage</a> locks in your rate for a predetermined period and then adjusts it periodically. Let’s say you get a 7/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first seven years, then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 23 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and housing market.</p>      <p>At the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. Your monthly payment toward<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/mortgage-principal-213811390.html"> mortgage principal</a> and interest stays the same throughout the years — however, less and less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.</p>   <ul><li> <p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/adjustable-rate-mortgage-vs-fixed-203423977.html"><em>Determine whether an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage is better for you.</em></a></p> </li> </ul>      <p>A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is a good choice if you want a lower mortgage payment and the predictability that comes with having a fixed rate. Just know that your rate will be higher than if you choose a shorter term, and you will pay significantly more in interest over the years.</p>   <p>You may want to consider a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage if you aim to pay off your home loan quickly and save money on interest. These shorter terms come with lower interest rates, and since you’re cutting your repayment time in half, you’ll save a lot in interest in the long run. But you’ll need to be sure you can comfortably afford the higher monthly payments that come with 15-year terms.</p>   <ul><li> <p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/15-vs-30-year-mortgage-155528370.html"><em>Learn how to decide between a 15-year and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.</em></a></p> </li> </ul>   <p>Typically, an adjustable-rate mortgage could be good if you plan to sell before the introductory rate period ends. Adjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, then your rate will change after a predetermined amount of time. However, 5/1 and 7/1 ARM rates have similar to (or even higher than) 30-year fixed rates recently. Before getting an ARM just for a lower rate, compare your rate options from term to term and lender to lender.</p>      <p>Mortgage rates have generally fallen since the end of last May, and home loan rates are just above three-year lows, according to Freddie Mac.</p>   <p>Economists don't expect drastic mortgage rate declines through the end of 2026. Even with the most recent rate pause of the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/federal-funds-rate-194457132.html">federal funds rate</a>, mortgage rates continue to hover in the low-6% range.</p>         <p>According to Freddie Mac, the national average 30-year mortgage fell by two basis points to 6.09% for the week, while the average 15-year mortgage rate dropped by six basis point to 5.44%.</p>      <p>According to its January forecast, the Mortgage Bankers Association expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.1% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through next year.</p>      <p>Mortgage rates are likely to remain little changed in 2027. The MBA predicts 30-year fixed rates of 6.2% to 6.3% in 2027. Fannie Mae predicts average rates near 6% for the full year of 2027.</p>      </div></div>

<h2><span> Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite: 30-second review</span></h2><p>Like the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/phone-communications/blackview-oscal-tank-1-rugged-phone-review" target="_blank">Oscal Tank 1</a> I recently reviewed from Blackview, the Xplore 2 Satellite is another large and heavy phone from this brand. The scale precludes it from being a daily driver because it doesn’t easily fit in a pocket, and at 675g, it's not lightweight.</p><p>The bottom rung is labelled the Standard model, then above that is the Satellite version reviewed here, and the top tier option has an inbuilt projector.</p><p>Depending on which of these you fancy, the price could start at $650 and reach $1040 for a Projector model with 16GB+1TB, though it's much lower outside the USA.</p><p>What you get for that investment is a modern 4nm SoC, a 6.73-inch OLED display, 50MP cameras front and rear, eSIM support, a 20000 mAh battery and 120W fast charging.</p><p>And the icing on the cake is a comms system that supports 3G, 4G, and 5G, and can also offer two-way GEO Satellite Voice/Text/Location Messaging with Skylo.</p><p>That makes the XPLORE 2 Satellite a genuinely go-anywhere design, within the context of that service. That includes the whole of the USA, Canada, Brazil, most of western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan will soon be added.</p><p>It doesn’t include Russia, China or any part of Africa, and therefore it's not a global solution. I’d classify it as of interest to those in remote US and Canadian locations, or in the jungles of Brazil.</p><p>Given the extensive capabilities of this device, the price seems impressively low, even for American customers, and an absolute bargain for Europeans.</p><p>But there is little reason to choose the Satellite model if you’re not prepared to pay for the Skylo service to use it. But even with those additional costs, this could be worth considering, especially if you intend to explore the locations covered by Skylo.</p><p>Despite some unique features, it is unlikely to be considered one of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-rugged-smartphones" target="_blank">best rugged phones</a> in our guide.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B7vooiLd3ktqU3a6sKtnk7.jpg" alt="Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite Smartphone">

However, while the Standard and Projector models are on <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FBlackview-Dimensity-Unlocked-20000mAh-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB0FVWW7D3F%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrdpro-us-4216270824547604806-20" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, I couldn’t find the Satellite version.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Apple has had some satellite comms since the iPhone 14, but two-way communication came with the iPhone 16 series, and the iPhone 17 (2025) supports SOS, location sharing, and messaging. Prices for the US version of the Apple iPhone 17 with 256GB start around $800 and increase exponentially from there.</p><p>Google and Samsung support the same Skylo service as Blackview on the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 series. A Pixel 9 costs $570 with only 128GB of storage, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 is about $10 less.</p><p>These are standard phones that can’t withstand the level of abuse the Xplore 2 can, and they only come with 128GB of storage at these prices.</p><p>Samsung also makes the Galaxy S26, which reportedly offers NTN/SCS satellite calling and messaging, but it has yet to be launched, so pricing is unavailable.</p><p>Huawei models like the Mate 50 and Mate 60 Pro do support satellite services via BeiDou, but obviously only in China.</p><p>And finally, the Infinix Note 60 series allegedly supports satellite calls and messages, though again, this might only be in China, and these phones aren’t available globally.</p><p>A dedicated satellite phone using the widest available service, Iridium, costs around $800 and up, with the majority of the better ones costing at least $1500. But these are dedicated satellite phones, not smartphones, and don’t support apps.</p><p>In the greater scheme of things, the Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite isn’t the best or most sophisticated satellite phone available, and Skylo has some parts of the world it doesn’t support, but it's certainly affordable.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ExQ7VZbmdjRjmsU2GKdUj7.jpg" alt="Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite Smartphone">

And, it’s also even heavier.</p><p>The mass and physical scale of this device make it inappropriate for those who don’t have strong wrists, and even those who do if you are forced to hold it for long periods.</p><p>It uses the same combination of milled aluminium and reinforced ABS that Blackview prefers, making it extremely robust and ideal for taking into harsh environments.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K4R7AusKySc9Uoe52KU6T7.jpg" alt="Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite Smartphone">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But, and this bit shocked me, for whatever reason, the button layout on this device seems to defy conventional logic. The power button, which doesn’t double as a fingerprint reader, is all alone on the right of the phone.</p><p>Where the custom button is together with the volume rocker on the left, which is odd. Also on the left is the SIM card tray, which, like the TANK 1, forces a choice between two Nano SIMs or one and a TF card. Except in this case, the phone supports an eSIM, so the loss of a physical SIM location isn’t the problem it might have been.</p><p>For those wondering, the fingerprint reader is under the screen.</p><p>Where the Tank 1 had the camping LEDs on the top edge, in the Xplore 2 Satellite, these are now on the back down the flanks of the body, and the only thing on the top edge is a vent and an IR transmitter.</p><p>I was expecting one of those stubby antennas that are typically a feature of satellite phones, but evidently that wasn’t required.</p><p>The rear camera cluster is centrally positioned, which makes for better-framed photographs, and Blackview included a wrist strap that utilises a through-hole on the bottom left of the chassis.</p><p>Other than the volume rocker inexplicably being on the left, there isn’t much to say about the design of this phone, as it's extremely bland, even by rugged phone standards.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6k93BXP3yeeMxZcS3pqM7.jpg" alt="Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite Smartphone">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Design score: 3.5/5</strong></p><h2><span> Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite: hardware</span></h2><ul><li><strong>MediaTek Dimensity 8300</strong></li><li><strong>120W charging</strong></li><li><strong>Satellite Comms</strong></li></ul><p>I could be mistaken, but I think this is the first phone I’ve reviewed with the Dimensity 8300, a modern mobile chipset built on an efficient 4nm manufacturing process. It is positioned as an upper mid-range processor, offering a balance of speed and efficiency suitable for demanding apps, multitasking and high-resolution displays.</p><p>This is a significant notch up from the 7300 that many rugged phones are using, as it</p><p>integrates the Mali G615 MC6 GPU, delivering a respectable graphics capability for everyday use.</p><p>It is also paired with the MediaTek NPU 580, enabling some competent on-device AI tasks and enhancing features such as imaging, optimisation and user assistance. However, Blackview would prefer you sign up for their AI Cloud services, and pay a monthly or yearly fee for the joy of chatting with software.</p><p>When placed in devices such as the Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite, the Dimensity 8300 forms part of a well-rounded hardware package that supports 5G connectivity, modern camera sensors and a high-resolution AMOLED screen.</p><p>There are faster platforms around, like the Snapdragon 8, but for this particular slice of the market, and rugged phones in particular, it is a practical choice for users who want reliable power without the premium price tag of flagship chipsets.</p><p>Given that the battery capacity of 20000 mAh is the same as that on the Oscal TANK 1, it would be reasonable to conclude that it’s the same battery. It isn’t.</p><p>That battery was rated for 55W recharging and had an odd dual battery architecture. Whereas the one in this phone doesn’t appear to be two batteries, and can recharge at an impressive 120W with the included charger.</p><p>In my testing, it's possible to recover 40% of the capacity in just 30 minutes and recharge the entire capacity in under 90 minutes. That’s a great aspect of this design, and I wish more phone makers would use battery technology this good. It also supports 10W reverse charging, if you like that sort of thing.</p><p>The feature that makes this phone special is the ability to access the Skylo satellite network available in certain regions to send messages and even make calls. On the Xplore 2 Satellite, this is managed by an app called Jathistar, which is pre-installed on the phone.</p><p>What’s important to understand about Jathistar is that in order to use the Sklyo, you must sign up when you have a conventional mobile comms or WiFi connection. There is no scenario where you wander off into the jungle, get yourself in trouble, and then decide to pay for the service. Although maybe Skylo are missing a trick by not selling emergency connections for a hefty fee.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncTzps8M4ZESJuSxZgPgt7.jpg" alt="Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite Smartphone">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Mark Pickavance)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To further clarify, Skylo doesn’t actually own any satellites. Instead, it partners with GEO operators, including Viasat/Inmarsat, Ligado, TerreStar, and EchoStar.</p><p>These have geostationary satellites over the regions where Skylo sells its service, which keep them in the same place in the sky at an orbital height of 35,786 kilometres.</p><p>The only snag with having them geostationary is that if the satellite you wish to access is obscured by a mountain, like the one you just fell off, then you can’t connect unless you move to a location where you can get line-of-sight. Therefore, this technology works well if you are on high ground, but not so well if you are deep in a valley or canyon surrounded by terrain. The comms in the Xplore 2 Satellite do have a wider beam of connectivity, offering 120 degrees from optimal, rather than the 60 degrees that most devices provide. But that’s not a guarantee you can connect anywhere.</p><p>Hopefully, when you do have that accident where you need help, you also have a friend handy who can get to high ground to make that important call or send that SOS message.</p><p>But, I must say that having a smartphone that can two-way communicate with a satellite suspended over 22,000 miles above the earth is an impressive ability, however you look at it.</p><p>The only prices on the Blackview site for this service are in Euros, but the cost isn’t crazy.</p><p>A basic Emergency Plan costs €4.99 a month and includes 20 messages, and a Frequent Use Plan is €9.99, but that includes 50 messages. There is also a Pay-As-You-Go that gives you complete flexibility, but you must sign up for one of these while you can connect conventionally before heading to the wilderness.</p><ul><li><strong>Hardware score: 4/5</strong></li></ul><h2><span> Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite: cameras</span></h2><ul><li><strong>50MP, 20MP on the rear</strong></li><li><strong>50MP on the front</strong></li><li><strong>Three cameras in total</strong></li></ul><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nMe47aMeuEJ2qt3jjzvGi7.jpg" alt="Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite Smartphone">

It’s part of Samsung’s GN series, which consists of high-quality, above mid-tier sensors designed for strong performance in mainstream and enthusiast smartphones.</p><p>It sits below Samsung’s flagship HP series (e.g., the 200MP HP9) but alongside other advanced 50MP solutions such as the GNJ. It evolved from the earlier GN sensors (e.g., GN5/GN3), offering improved light capture and modern ISOCELL technology.</p><p>What’s good about this sensor is that it makes the most of 50MP, has plenty of premium imaging features without the power that Samsung’s highest-tier sensors demand.</p><p>As you can see from the examples, the GN9’s Tetrapixel (Quad Bayer) structure and ISOCELL technology support good light sensitivity, enabling strong performance in daylight and acceptable results in lower light conditions. However, if you are working in low light, it's probably a better plan to select “Night Vision” and use the 20MP Sony IMX376 Night Vision IR sensor, as it's made for that job.</p><p>Where Samsung improved beyond the GN9 was in dynamic range, and advanced zoom/telephoto algorithms, and like the TANK 1, there are no zoom optics to avoid the cropped digital zoom images.</p><p>In other respects, this is the camera sensor you probably want, as it has the ability to output RAW10, support PDAF (Super PD), and record 4K video at 60fps, making it a versatile 50MP sensor.</p><p>A nice touch is that the Samsung GN1 front-facing camera can also capture 4K at 60fps, if you are OK with being seen in that level of detail.</p><p>Even if it has fewer pixels than the 64MP Omnivision OV64b used in the TANK 1, the results from the GN9 are undoubtedly superior, and elevate this phone to being one that is worth bringing along for photo taking.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zUAYweHMocii2eYGp6Set7.jpg" alt="Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite Smartphone">

And, since I tested the Oukitel WP210 with the Dimensity 8200 SoC, I had that data to hand.</p><p>I think it’s safe to say that the 8300 offers between 9% and 15% more power than the 8200, although in the Nomad Lite test its almost twice as good. UL needs to update 3DMark because both these SoCs maxed out most of their 3DMark benchmarks. Unfortunately, since GFX ended its benchmark, there are limited tools to judge graphics performance on a phone.</p><p>What I need to mention is that where SoC performance can be compared on these devices, the Oukitel WP210 is a lightweight rugged design that has a significantly smaller battery, giving about half the running life of the Xplore 2. If those running times are adjusted for the amount of battery capacity, the Xplore 2 is marginally less efficient. But as it has a faster processor, it would probably do more within the same timeframe.</p><p>When I previously tested the Blackview Oscal Tank 1, it had the same overall battery capacity but lasted much longer due to being a less powerful platform. However, that phone had an unfortunate feature of crashing PCMark when half the capacity was used up due to a dual-battery arrangement.</p><p>The battery in the Xplore 2 didn’t exhibit this issue, but it also charged dramatically faster using the 120W charger provided by Blackview with the phone. To put 20000 mAh back in the TANK 1 took nearly four hours, whereas doing the same on the Xplore 2 can be accomplished in 90 minutes.</p><p>As shown here, even if you wake and realise the phone is depleted, by the time you get dressed and have breakfast, it can probably reach 50% charge.</p><p>Overall, this platform performs well and delivers an excellent user experience.</p><ul><li><strong>Performance score: 4/5</strong></li></ul><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H3nzAmN9SuBiHQybpduwwc.jpg" alt="Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Blackview)</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span> Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite: Final verdict</span></h2><p>This is a big phone, and therefore, it's not the most practical device to carry around every day. But if the one job of this device is to achieve communications from a remote location that doesn’t have cell service, then it might be worth its considerable weight in gold.</p><p>The caveat to its use is that there are significant parts of the world where there isn’t any Skylo coverage, so make sure there is service in that region before you go into that jungle or up that mountain carrying it.</p><p>As a device, it’s serviceable and has sufficient performance for a wide range of uses. Hardened gamers might wish it were Snapdragon-powered, but for those not playing demanding 3D games, there is plenty of power in the Dimensity 8300 SoC.</p><p>Looking at the Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite holistically, it’s a decent Android phone with a punchy SoC, a terrific OLED display, effective cameras, plenty of battery life, and the ability to make calls via satellite. And, depending on where you get it, at around $500, that seems like an excellent deal.</p><h3><span>Should I buy a Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite?</span></h3><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><caption> Blackview Xplore 2 Satellite Score Card</caption><thead><tr><th colspan="1"><p>Attributes</p></th><th colspan="1"><p>Notes</p></th><th colspan="1"><p>Rating</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Value</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>An affordable satellite phone</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4/5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Design</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Heavy phone with a curious button layout</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>3.5/5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Hardware</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Powerful SoC, 20000 mAh battery and Satellite comms</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4/5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Camera</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4K video front and back, but no optical zoom</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4/5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Performance</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>A great all-round performer</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4/5</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Overall</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Not a practical size, but it’s a satellite phone</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4/5</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h2>Buy it if...</h2><h2>Don't buy it if...</h2><h3><span>Also Consider</span></h3><hr><p><em>For more ruggedized devices, we've reviewed the </em><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-rugged-tablets" target="_blank"><em>best rugged tablets</em></a><em>, the </em><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-rugged-laptops" target="_blank"><em>best rugged laptops</em></a><em>, and the </em><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-rugged-hard-drives" target="_blank"><em>best rugged hard drives</em></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus">Apple TV</a> has a slimmer-than-usual lineup of new movies on the way this year, and while that’s disappointing in itself for us film buffs, what’s even more notable is the lack of theatrical releases that have been announced.</p><p>If you saw my roundup of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/apple-tv-just-gave-me-a-sneak-preview-of-its-2026-lineup-of-movies-and-shows-from-monarch-legacy-of-monsters-season-2-to-margos-got-money-problems">new Apple TV movies and shows coming in 2026</a> last week, you'll already know that the studio doesn't have a blockbuster-worthy film slate either. For instance, how do you release a movie about one of Mattel’s most popular kids' toys and not expect even a sliver of the same reception that <em>Barbie </em>had?</p><figure><div><p>

</p></div><figcaption><span><em>Matchbox: The Movie</em> will premiere on Apple TV October 9. </span><span>(Image credit: Apple TV)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Mattel teamed up with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> and Sky Dance to bring to life a high octane story inspired by everything we love about its iconic Matchbox fleet – the deep nostalgia, the minute attention to detail, the pure imagination and feeling that you can climb into anything with an engine and push it to the absolute limit," the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/peacemaker-season-2-review"><em>Peacemaker</em></a><em> </em>actor said at last week's Apple TV press event.</p><p>Apple TV's direct-to-streaming approach to <em>Matchbox: The Movie</em> looks to be the same for the rest of its yet-to-be-released films, including <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/jonah-hill-says-his-new-apple-tv-movie-uses-fame-as-a-metaphor-for-what-we-all-go-through-on-social-media-heres-what-we-know-so-far-about-outcome"><em>Outcome</em></a><em>, Way of the Warrior of the Kid, Mayday, </em>and <em>The Dink</em> – with the exception of<em> Eternity</em>, which did have a theatrical release last year before it landed on the streaming service.</p><p>What's even more puzzling here is that <em>The Dink </em>has the potential to be as popular as Oscar-nominee <em>Marty Supreme, </em>as it would effectively build on the growing interest we've seen for racket sports off the back of it<em>. </em>"Whether you love pickleball or you hate it with a passion, we think you’re going to love our movie<em> </em>that comes out on July 25," Jake Johnson, who plays the protagonist, said at the same Apple TV showcase.</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><figure><div><p>

</p></div><figcaption><span><em>The Dink </em>is set to be available to stream on Apple TV July 24. </span><span>(Image credit: Apple TV)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's the same for <em>Way of the Warrior of the Kid, </em>which also has big-name talent attached and an already established audience, thanks to being an adaptation. "It’s based on the best-selling book series by Jocko [Willink], which has inspired so many kids and their parents to work harder, push themselves further and become leaders in their community," lead star Chris Pratt said about the movie before adding: "It’s like this generation’s <em>Karate Kid </em>with an inspiring message."</p><p>As someone who <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/ive-streamed-every-new-apple-tv-movie-in-2025-but-none-of-them-match-its-hit-series">streamed every new Apple TV movie in 2025</a>, I get that the studio is increasingly focusing less on theatrical releases because of the high marketing and production costs and the potential for bad press from box-office flops. But as a cinephile, I can't help feeling these films have all the ingredients of a surefire blockbuster: spectacle, recognizable stars, and nostalgia.</p><p>There’s a lot here that would get bums on seats. That said, I've been digging more into all the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/new-movies-2026-guide">new movies</a> Apple TV has on the way, and there may be another major flick that the studio is waiting to throw its full theatrical weight behind.</p><figure><div><p>

That’s not the same this year, with only six films currently lined up to be released, but there are plenty of other films in production.</p><p>In fact, Apple TV has several projects in the pipeline that have already finished filming. These include an adaptation of Judith Heumann's memoir, <em>Being Heumann; </em>a biographical drama about the Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, <em>Tenzing;</em> a psychological thriller starring Idris Elba, <em>This Is How It Goes;</em> and Mark Wahlberg's sports comedy, <em>Weekend Warriors</em>.</p><p>After landing the global rights, Apple Studios also appears to be starting production on a psychological thriller called <em>Sponsor, </em>starring and co-written by Jason Segel. Perhaps most excitingly, though, is an upcoming film from Martin Scorsese that has not yet gone into production.</p><figure><div><p>

</p></div><figcaption><span><em>Outcome </em>is another new Apple TV movie set to be released on April 10. </span><span>(Image credit: Apple TV)</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>What Happens At Night </em>is an adaptation of Peter Cameron's novel of the same name that follows an American couple who travel to a small European town to adopt a baby. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, the upcoming film marks the second collaboration for Scorsese, DiCaprio, and Apple following <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>.</p><p>Now, <em>Killers of the Flower Moon </em>was by no means a box office success, but that's not say that Scorsese and DiCaprio's next film would suffer a similar fate. After all, the duo has proven to be one of the most financially successful team-ups in Hollywood, following <em>Gangs of New York, The Departed, </em>and <em>The</em> <em>Wolf of Wall Street. </em></p><p>If there was any film that Apple TV might want to reverse its cinema stance on, <em>What Happens At Night </em>feels like the obvious candidate<em>. </em>When <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/apple-tvs-new-logo-could-be-hiding-a-big-clue-about-its-movie-strategy-and-i-think-i-know-what-its-hinting-at%20">Apple TV unveiled its new logo, I wondered </a><a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus/apple-tvs-new-logo-could-be-hiding-a-big-clue-about-its-movie-strategy-and-i-think-i-know-what-its-hinting-at%20" target="_blank">whether it hinted at a changing movie strategy</a> that could see it invest more in theatrical distribution.</p><p>There’s no firm evidence of that yet, but if last year's rumors of it considering an expansion into theatrical releases are true, this could be the film Apple finally goes all in on. It’s just a shame this year’s movies might miss their moment on the big screen.</p><hr /><hr /><p><em></em><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

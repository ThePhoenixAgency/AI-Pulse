    <div><div><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Bitcoin is attempting a comeback, which is expected to face stiff resistance at the breakdown level of $74,508.</p></li><li><p>Several major altcoins are attempting a recovery, signaling that lower levels are attracting buyers.</p></li></ul><p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) has risen above $68,500, as buyers attempt to form a higher low near $65,000. According to Glassnode, BTC is stuck between the true market mean at $79,200 and the realized price near $55,000. The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-analysts-predict-prolonged-consolidation-phase-for-btc-price">onchain data provider expects the range-bound action</a> to continue until a major catalyst pushes the price either above or below the range.</p><p>Standard Chartered also had a muted forecast for BTC. It <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-410-million-outflows-standard-chartered-cut-target">lowered BTC’s target to $100,000 from $150,000</a> for 2026. The bank expects BTC to fall to $50,000 over the next few months, followed by a recovery for the remainder of the year.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-a2c1-7a7e-b7dc-03e971964e66.png" /><figcaption><em>Crypto market data daily view.

Crypto analyst Tony Research said in a post on X that BTC will bottom in the $40,000 to $50,000 zone, possibly “between mid-September and late November 2026.”</p><p>Could BTC and the major altcoins start a recovery? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>BTC turned up from $65,118 on Thursday, indicating demand at lower levels. The bulls will try to push the price to the breakdown level of $74,508.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-a6ad-79a6-8b11-e7bf7809a8f3.png" /><figcaption><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/</em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT" target="_blank"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>If the Bitcoin price turns down sharply from the $74,508 level, it suggests that the bears remain active at higher levels. That may keep the BTC/USDT pair between $74,508 and $60,000 for a few days. On the downside, a break below the $60,000 support may sink the pair to $52,500.</p><p>Alternatively, if buyers thrust the price above $74,508, it suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair may then rally to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($85,046).</p><h2>Ether price prediction</h2><p>Buyers are attempting to push and maintain Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH</a>) above the $2,000 level, but the bears have kept up the pressure.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-aa0a-70ff-a54b-c24d6c0961f4.png" /><figcaption><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>If the price turns down from the current level or the $2,111 resistance, it suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the level. The Ether price may then retest the critical support at $1,750. If the level cracks, the ETH/USDT pair may extend the decline to the next major support at $1,537.</p><p>On the upside, buyers will have to swiftly push the price above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($2,297) to signal a comeback. If they manage to do that, the pair may ascend to the 50-day SMA ($2,800).</p><h2>BNB price prediction</h2><p>BNB (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index">BNB</a>) continues to gradually slide toward the strong support at $570, which is a vital level to watch out for.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-ad7f-79d0-96c8-f27438e439c3.png" /><figcaption><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>If the BNB price plunges below the $570 support, it signals the start of the next leg of the downtrend toward the psychological level of $500. </p><p>However, the relative strength index (RSI) is in oversold territory, indicating that a relief rally is possible in the near term. If the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will attempt to push the BNB/USDT pair above the $669 level. If they can pull it off, the pair may march toward the 20-day EMA ($710).</p><h2>XRP price prediction</h2><p>XRP (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>) has been clinging to the support line of the descending channel pattern, increasing the risk of a breakdown.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-b0dd-7afe-b03b-dc7231503a76.png" /><figcaption><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>If that happens, the XRP price may drop to the $1.11 level. This is a critical level for the bulls to defend, as a break below it may resume the downtrend. The XRP/USDT pair may then fall to $1 and subsequently to $0.75.</p><p>Contrarily, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the20-day EMA ($1.55), it suggests that the pair may remain inside the channel for some more time. Buyers will have to achieve a close above the downtrend line to signal a potential trend change.</p><h2>Solana price prediction</h2><p>Solana (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index">SOL</a>) is trying to find support at the $77 level, but the bears are likely to sell on rallies.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-b44b-7c9b-abcc-583521fa470e.png" /><figcaption><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The SOL/USDT pair may reach the breakdown level of $95, where the bears are expected to pose a strong challenge. If the price turns down sharply from the $95 level, it suggests that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. The Solana price may then plummet to the $67 level.</p><p>Conversely, if buyers push the price above the $95 level, the pair may rally to the 50-day SMA ($119). That suggests the break below the $95 level may have been a bear trap.</p><h2>Dogecoin price prediction</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index">DOGE</a>) is attempting to bounce off the $0.09 level, but the bears continue to sell on minor rallies.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-b77e-75a3-875f-ab2e76290312.png" /><figcaption><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>If the Dogecoin price turns down and breaks below $0.09, the DOGE/USDT pair may drop to the $0.08 level. This is a crucial level for the bulls to defend, as a break below it may extend the downtrend to $0.06.</p><p>The first sign of strength will be a break and close above the 20-day EMA ($0.10). The pair may then rally to the breakdown level of $0.12, which is likely to act as stiff resistance. A break above the $0.12 level opens the doors for a rally to $0.16.</p><h2>Bitcoin Cash price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin Cash (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index">BCH</a>) broke below the $497 support on Thursday, but the bulls failed to sustain the lower levels.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-baa8-750e-892f-920fca91869a.png" /><figcaption><em>BCH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls are attempting to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($536) but are expected to face significant resistance from the bears. If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below $493, the BCH/USDT pair may plunge toward the $443 level.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price breaks and closes above the 20-day EMA, it suggests demand at lower levels. The Bitcoin Cash price may then rally to the 50-day SMA ($581), where the bears are again expected to mount a strong defense.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-open-interest-hits-lows-not-seen-since-2024-is-tradfi-abandoning-btc"><em><strong>Bitcoin open interest hits lows not seen since 2024: Is TradFi abandoning BTC?</strong></em></a></p><h2>Hyperliquid price prediction</h2><p>Hyperliquid (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/hyperliquid-price-index">HYPE</a>) has risen back above the 20-day EMA ($30.18) on Thursday, indicating buying on dips.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-bdfe-7e05-9670-fbd21f260b88.png" /><figcaption><em>HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. Buyers will have to propel the Hyperliquid price above the $35.50 level to indicate that the corrective phase may have ended. The HYPE/USDT pair may then ascend to $44.</p><p>Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($27.25), it signals that the bears have an edge. The pair may then slump to the $20.82 support.</p><h2>Cardano price prediction</h2><p>Cardano (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index">ADA</a>) remains inside the descending channel pattern, indicating that the bears remain in charge.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-c125-75d1-87cc-8ad3391154b6.png" /><figcaption><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bears will attempt to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the support line and the $0.22 level. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair may descend to $0.20 and later to $0.15.</p><p>Instead, if the Cardano price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($0.29), it signals that the pair may remain inside the channel for some more time. Buyers will seize control on a close above the channel.</p><h2>Monero price prediction</h2><p>Monero (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xmr-price-index">XMR</a>) is facing resistance at the breakdown level of $360, but the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57fa-c448-7498-bdb0-369b46d84b97.png" /><figcaption><em>XMR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>That increases the likelihood of a break above $360. If that happens, the bears will again try to halt the recovery at the 20-day EMA ($385). However, buyers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pierce the 20-day EMA, clearing the path for a rally toward the 50-day SMA ($460).</p><p>This positive view will be negated in the near term if the Monero price continues lower and breaks below $309. The XMR/USDT pair may then plummet to $276, which is likely to attract buyers.</p></div><p><span>This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

AI-generated content is everywhere now and is a threat to the livelihoods of real creators everywhere," said Romain Kidd, the new CEO of Thingiverse.</p><p>“We know from launching SoulCrafted that there's real demand for spaces where human work is valued and protected. Thingiverse will be one of those spaces. Thingiverse belongs to the people who use it. We want them involved in what happens next."</p><p>MyMiniFactory reports distributing more than $100 million directly to creators through paid model sales, supporting thousands of independent designers and nearly 1 million paying users.</p><p>Unlike manufacturer-operated repositories that function primarily as ecosystem add-ons, MyMiniFactory has focused on curation and verified printability.</p><p>Every uploaded file undergoes human review before publication, an approach the company argues strengthens reliability and creator compensation.</p><p>Many designers have used Thingiverse mainly to promote paid offerings hosted elsewhere, reflecting limitations in its economic structure.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/3d-printing/myminifactory-acquires-thingiverse-to-save-3d-printing-file-sharing-from-ai-thingverse-has-eight-million-users-and-2-5-million-things" target="_blank">Toms Hardware</a></p><hr><p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em> </em><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

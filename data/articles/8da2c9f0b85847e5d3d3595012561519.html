No arrests have been made so far, he added.</p> <p>The incident has fuelled tension between France's <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/far-right/" target="_self">far right</a> and hard left ahead of municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race.</p> <p>The government blamed rhetoric from the hard-left <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france-unbowed/" target="_self">France Unbowed</a> (LFI) party for fuelling the violence that led to his death.</p> <p>The far right blamed the killing on la Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist youth group co-founded by an LFI lawmaker before he was elected to parliament.</p> <p>The group&nbsp;– which was dissolved in June&nbsp;– denied any links to the "tragic events".</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260214-french-president-macron-urges-restraint-after-right-wing-youth-fatally-beaten" target="_self">France's Macron urges restraint after right-wing youth fatally beaten</a></p> <p>Government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon accused the LFI Monday of having "encouraged a climate of violence for years".</p> <p>"There is therefore&nbsp;– in light of the political climate and the climate of violence&nbsp;– a moral responsibility on the part of LFI" for the attack on Thursday, she told television broadcaster BFMTV.</p> <p>Raphael Glucksmann, a centre left member of European parliament, also lambasted the hard left party.</p> <p>"It's unthinkable that, on the left, we would continue to harbour the slightest doubt about a possible electoral alliance with LFI," he told the RTL broadcaster.</p> <p>The left, including LFI, allied against the far right after President <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/emmanuel-macron/" target="_self">Emmanuel Macron</a> took a gamble by calling for <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/french-legislative-elections-2024/" target="_self">snap parliamentary elections in 2024</a>.</p> <p>But Macron lost even more of his majority, and the anti-immigration <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/national-rally-national-front/" target="_self">National Rally (RN</a>) became the biggest party in the lower house.</p> <h2>'Pitched battle'</h2> <p>According to a source close to the probe into the Lyon killing, there was "a pitched battle between members of the far left and the far right".</p> <p>A video broadcast by TF1 television of the alleged attack shows a dozen people hitting three others lying on the ground, two of whom manage to escape.</p> <p>A witness said "people were hitting each other with iron bars".</p> <p>LFI's veteran leader <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jean-luc-m%C3%A9lenchon/" target="_self">Jean-Luc Melenchon</a>, a three-time presidential candidate widely expected to run again next year, has denied his party were to blame.</p> <p>On the far right, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/marine-le-pen/" target="_self">Marine Le Pen</a>, who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, condemned the "barbarians responsible for this lynching".</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260211-verdict-for-french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-s-appeals-trial-expected-on-july-7" target="_self">Paris appeals court sets verdict in far-right leader Le Pen’s graft case for July 7</a></p> <p>Opinion polls put the far right in the lead for the presidency in 2027, when Macron will have to step down after the maximum two consecutive terms in office.</p> <p>Le Pen has said she will decide whether to run after an appeal court ruling in July, when she could hand over to her lieutenant <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jordan-bardella/" target="_self">Jordan Bardella</a>.</p> <p>A poll of 1,000 people published on Sunday placed Bardella as the preferred candidate in the 2027 vote, ahead of Le Pen in second place.</p> <p>Centrist ex-prime minister Edouard Philippe, a candidate, and Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin were in joint third place.</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AFP)</em></p> </div></div>

It's coming."</p></div><div><p>The first rehearsal, which took place at the beginning of February, ended early because of a hydrogen fuel leak at the launch pad.</p></div><div><p>Glaze said issues including with seals and filters had now been remedied.</p></div><div><p>"Yesterday we were able to fully tank the SLS rocket within the planned time line […] we also succesfully demonstrated the launch countdown," she said.</p></div><div><p>Three Americans - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, make up the Artemis II crew.</p></div><div><p>Glaze said the crew were excited following the successful rehearsal and would go into quarantine later on Friday.</p></div><div><p>They'll begin their journey on Nasa's mega Moon rocket: the 98m-tall (322ft) Space Launch System, or SLS.</p></div><div><p>It's only flown once before in November 2022 for the Artemis I mission, but this was with no people onboard.</p></div><div><p>The crew will be strapped into the Orion capsule, which is located at the top of the rocket.</p></div><div><p>The inside of their spacecraft is about the size of a minibus, and it's where the four will live, eat, work and sleep during the 10-day mission.</p></div><div><p>The first day of their journey will be spent in orbit around the Earth, then if all systems are working well, the astronauts will head towards the Moon.</p></div><div><p>The voyage takes about four days, and the crew will travel around the far side of the Moon, which is the side we never see from Earth.</p></div><div><p>They'll be at a distance of 6,500-9,500km (4,000 to 6,000 miles) above the lunar surface, and will have several hours dedicated to studying and taking images of the Moon.</p></div><div><p>After the fly by, the astronauts will begin their four-day journey home. They will end the mission with a splash down in the Pacific Ocean.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fa1b/live/38fca780-08de-11f1-9972-d3f265c101c6.jpg.webp" alt="NASA Astronaut Harrison Schmitt in a white spacesuit stands on the surface of the Moon.

But delays to the Starship rocket have led Nasa to ask SpaceX for a new streamlined plan to speed a return to the Moon.</p></div><div><p>Nasa has also asked rival company Blue Origin - which is owned by Jeff Bezos - to come up with an accelerated lunar plan for Artemis III.</p></div><div><p>As the tech billionaires battle it out, the US is under pressure to return to the Moon. China is aiming for a lunar landing by 2030, and has been making steady progress towards this.</p></div><div><p>Both nations are planning to land at the Moon's south pole - and are competing for the best spots to build their lunar bases.</p></div></article></div></div>

<p>Apple has not shared an official date for the first iOS 26.4 beta. Still, the broader release cycle offers a strong clue. iOS 26.3 is nearing the end of its beta phase, with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/ios-26-3-release-candidate-is-now-available-for-iphone/">release candidate builds</a> already in testing. That usually signals the next beta branch is close.</p>



<p>Based on internal timelines and long-standing release patterns, iOS 26.4 beta 1 is expected to arrive between late February and early March 2026. Apple has already committed to launching the finished update in spring, which lines up with a public release window in late March or April.</p>



<p>Apple often uses x.4 updates to deliver larger feature drops that miss the fall release. This makes iOS 26.4 more important than a typical mid-cycle update.</p>



<h2>iOS .4 betas in previous years</h2>



<p>Looking back at recent iOS cycles helps narrow down the likely timing. The gap between x.3 and x.4 releases has stayed fairly consistent, even when features slipped.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>iOS version</th><th>Beta 1 release</th><th>Gap after .3</th><th>Public release</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>iOS 18.4</td><td>February 21</td><td>About 25 days</td><td>March 31</td></tr><tr><td>iOS 17.4</td><td>January 25</td><td>About 3 days</td><td>March 5</td></tr><tr><td>iOS 16.4</td><td>February 16</td><td>About 24 days</td><td>March 27</td></tr><tr><td>iOS 15.4</td><td>January 27</td><td>About 1 day</td><td>March 14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If Apple follows this pattern, iOS 26.4 beta 1 should land in early March at the latest. That would give Apple four to six weeks of testing before pushing the update to everyone.</p>



<h2>iOS 26.4</h2>



<p>iOS 26.4 is shaping up to be a feature-heavy update, largely because of Siri. Apple is using this release to finally deliver the Apple Intelligence-powered assistant it previewed earlier and then delayed.</p>



<h3>Siri revamp</h3>



<p>The biggest change in iOS 26.4 is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/new-report-confirms-internal-apple-deadline-for-revamped-siri/">ground-up rebuild</a> of Siri. Apple is replacing the old multi-model system with a single large language model core. This gives Siri the ability to reason through requests instead of reacting to keywords.</p>



<p>Today’s Siri works well for basic tasks but struggles with anything complex. It cannot handle multi-step actions, follow natural language well, or keep context across requests. The new architecture aims to fix that.</p>



<p>Key Siri improvements expected in iOS 26.4 include:</p>



<ul>
<li>An LLM-based core that understands intent and nuance, not just commands</li>



<li>Personal context, allowing Siri to reference emails, messages, files, and photos</li>



<li>On-screen awareness, so Siri knows what you are looking at and can act on it</li>



<li>Deeper app integration, enabling actions across multiple apps in one request</li>
</ul>



<p>Apple is not turning Siri into a full chatbot yet. Conversations will still be short and task-focused. Long-term memory and free-flow chat are planned for a later release.</p>



<h3>Google Gemini plays a key role</h3>



<p>Another major shift is Apple’s decision to work with Google’s Gemini team. For now, many public-facing AI features in Siri will <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-may-demo-gemini-powered-siri-in-ios-26-4-beta-next-month/">rely on a custom Gemini-based model</a> built with Apple. Apple will still run some tasks on the device and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-explains-how-gemini-fits-into-siri-with-private-cloud-compute/">use Private Cloud Compute to protect</a> user privacy.</p>



<p>Apple says personal data will stay on the device whenever possible, requests will be anonymized, and all AI features will remain optional.</p>



<h3>Other changes rumored for iOS 26.4</h3>



<p>While Siri is the headline feature, iOS 26.4 is expected to include smaller quality-of-life updates as well.</p>



<ul>
<li>New <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apples-next-emoji-update-could-bring-a-pickle-butterfly-and-new-thumbs/">emoji added</a> to the system set</li>



<li>Expanded AutoFill support for third-party apps</li>



<li>Folders inside Freeform for better organization</li>



<li>Security improvements related to device verification</li>



<li>Find My enhancements for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/ios-26-4-leaks-offer-early-look-at-ios-27-and-ios-28-features/">more accurate tracking</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/ios-26-4-leaks-offer-early-look-at-ios-27-and-ios-28-features/">reports also point to early groundwork</a> for future Health app upgrades, though major changes there may come later.</p>



<p>Apple’s delay of the smarter Siri, first shown in 2024, became a major internal issue. The company admitted that its hybrid AI system failed and had to be replaced entirely. That decision pushed Siri’s relaunch into 2026.</p>



<p>Since then, Apple has restructured its AI leadership and shifted strategy. Executives have said this new approach allows Apple to deliver more than it originally promised. iOS 26.4 is the first real test of that claim.</p>



<h2>Expect this next</h2>



<p>If Apple stays on schedule, developers should see the first iOS 26.4 beta by late February or early March. The public release should follow in late March or April.</p>



<p>This update will not make Siri a chatbot yet, but it sets the foundation. Apple plans to push even further with iOS 27, where Siri is expected to gain full conversational abilities. For now, iOS 26.4 marks Apple’s most important Siri update in years.</p>

<p>Apple has not shared an official date for the first iOS 26.4 beta. Still, the broader release cycle offers a strong clue. iOS 26.3 is nearing the end of its beta phase, with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/ios-26-3-release-candidate-is-now-available-for-iphone/">release candidate builds</a> already in testing. That usually signals the next beta branch is close.</p>



<p>Developers could see the first public build as a developer beta around the <strong>week of February 23, 2026.</strong> Apple usually follows developer previews with a public beta one to two weeks later, then a full release in late March or early April. Final timing will depend on test results and any further issues uncovered during the beta period.</p>



<p>iOS 26.4 sits on top of the broader iOS 26 platform that Apple introduced in 2025 with a refreshed interface, known as <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/tips/how-to/liquid-glass-explained-what-it-is-and-how-to-customize-it/">Liquid Glass</a></em>, and several redesigned core apps. That release marked one of the biggest iOS redesigns in years and set expectations for significant follow-on updates.</p>



<h2>Expected Dates</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Developer beta release</strong>: Week of February 23, 2026 (expected)</li>



<li><strong>Public beta</strong>: Early March (likely)</li>



<li><strong>Stable public release</strong>: Late March to early April (possible)</li>



<li><strong>Some Siri features delayed</strong>: iOS 26.5 (May 2026) or iOS 27 (September 2026)</li>
</ul>



<h2>iOS 26.4</h2>



<p>iOS 26.4 will focus on a mix of user-facing upgrades, under-the-hood fixes, and early AI improvements. Some features are confirmed by multiple leaks, while others still appear speculative.</p>



<p><strong>Here are the main additions expected in iOS 26.4:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>A more <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/new-report-confirms-internal-apple-deadline-for-revamped-siri/">powerful Siri with better context understanding</a>. Early code and reporting suggest that Siri will be able to look across apps for personal data, including messages, emails, and calendars, to provide richer answers.</li>



<li>Smarter on-screen awareness, letting Siri help with tasks based on what’s visible on your iPhone.</li>



<li>Expanded voice and cross-app controls, so you can ask Siri to trigger actions in third-party apps when permissions allow.</li>



<li>New <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apples-next-emoji-update-could-bring-a-pickle-butterfly-and-new-thumbs/">emoji additions</a>, like icons for everyday objects and symbols, adding variety to typing options.</li>



<li>A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/ios-26-4-leaks-offer-early-look-at-ios-27-and-ios-28-features/">refreshed Health app</a>, with layout changes and easier-to-use metrics, according to leaks from internal test builds.</li>



<li>Minor tweaks in apps such as Freeform and core utilities, like the ability to organize Freeform boards into folders.</li>



<li>Find My enhancements for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/ios-26-4-leaks-offer-early-look-at-ios-27-and-ios-28-features/">more accurate tracking</a></li>
</ul>



<p>These enhancements reflect Apple’s strategy to improve daily use of the iPhone while gradually introducing more advanced capabilities. Some features will show up first in beta before wider public availability.</p>



<h3>Google Gemini plays a key role</h3>



<p>Another major shift is Apple’s decision to work with Google’s Gemini team. For now, many public-facing AI features in Siri will <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-may-demo-gemini-powered-siri-in-ios-26-4-beta-next-month/">rely on a custom Gemini-based model</a> built by Apple. Apple will still run some tasks on the device and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-explains-how-gemini-fits-into-siri-with-private-cloud-compute/">use Private Cloud Compute to protect</a> user privacy.</p>



<p>However, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/ios-26-4-faces-delays-as-apple-struggles-to-ship-gemini-powered-siri/">reports now say</a> that Apple’s most advanced <strong>Siri features may not ship with iOS 26.4.</strong> Internal testing has revealed quality problems and performance issues, particularly with the parts powered by machine learning. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said that key context-aware functions and deeper app integrations have been postponed to later releases, like iOS 26.5 in May or even iOS 27 in September.</p>



<p>Testing setbacks appear to have slowed down the planned rollout. Some capabilities, such as Siri acting as a full chatbot with long ongoing conversations and deeper responses, are now expected in iOS 27 instead of iOS 26.4.</p>



<h3>Devices that will get iOS 26.4</h3>



<p>iOS updates typically support all devices that already run the parent version, unless there are specific hardware requirements. iOS 26.4 should work on all iPhones that support iOS 26. That list includes recent models with an A13 Bionic chip or newer. Older devices that no longer receive updates will not get this build.</p>



<p>Some Siri and Apple Intelligence features need newer chips, often starting with the A17-class silicon in recent iPhone models. This hardware requirement makes contextual AI features more reliable on modern devices with dedicated neural engines.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>iOS 26.4 is on track to be a meaningful iPhone update this spring. It will introduce smarter Siri behavior, context-aware controls, new emoji, and improvements in several built-in apps. The first beta could arrive in late February, with a wider rollout soon after. Some of the most advanced AI and chatbot-style features that were first announced long ago are reportedly pushed to later releases. These delays show how complex modern AI features can be, especially when built on third-party models like Google’s Gemini.</p>

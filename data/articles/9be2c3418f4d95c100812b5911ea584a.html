<p>Google on Friday released security updates for its Chrome browser to address a security flaw that it said has been exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>The high-severity vulnerability, tracked as <strong><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2026-2441" target="_blank">CVE-2026-2441</a></strong> (CVSS score: 8.8), has been described as a use-after-free bug in CSS. Security researcher Shaheen Fazim has been credited with discovering and reporting the shortcoming on February 11, 2026.</p>
<p>"Use after free in CSS in Google Chrome prior to 145.0.7632.75 allowed a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via a crafted HTML page," according to a description of the flaw in the NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD).</p>
<p>Google did not disclose any details about how the vulnerability is being exploited in the wild, by whom, or who may have been targeted, but it <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2026/02/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_13.html" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> that "an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild."</p>

<p>While Google Chrome is no stranger to actively exploited vulnerabilities, the development once again highlights how browser-based flaws are an attractive target for malicious actors, given that they are installed everywhere and expose a broad attack surface.</p>
<p>The disclosure of CVE-2026-2441 makes it the first actively exploited zero-day in Chrome that Google has patched in 2026. Last year, the tech giant <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/chrome-targeted-by-active-in-wild.html" target="_blank">addressed</a> eight zero-day flaws in Chrome that were either actively exploited or demonstrated as a proof-of-concept (PoC).</p>
<p>Last week, Apple also <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/apple-fixes-exploited-zero-day.html" target="_blank">shipped</a> iOS, iPadOS, macOS Tahoe, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS updates to address a zero-day flaw (CVE-2026-20700, CVSS score: 7.8) that had been weaponized as a zero-day to execute arbitrary code on susceptible devices as part of an "extremely sophisticated attack" targeting specific individuals who were running iOS versions before iOS 26.</p>
<p>For optimal protection, users are advised to update their Chrome browser to versions 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows and Apple macOS, and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux. To make sure the latest updates are installed, users can navigate to More &gt; Help &gt; About Google Chrome and select Relaunch.</p>
<p>Users of other Chromium-based browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi, are also advised to apply the fixes as and when they become available.</p>

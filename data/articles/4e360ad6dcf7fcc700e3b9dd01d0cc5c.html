  <h1>Ending production of Home Assistant Yellow</h1>

<p>Today, we’re announcing that we will no longer be producing <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow">Home Assistant Yellow</a>. Rest assured, it will continue to receive software support far into the future.<a name="read-more"></a></p>
<p>I’m Carl, Vice President of Commercial at Nabu Casa, the organization that builds and sells official hardware for the Open Home Foundation. I couldn’t be more proud of our hardware achievements over the past 12 months, including <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/">Voice Preview Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/connect/zwa-2/">Connect ZWA-2</a> (including its cool new <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/10/13/portable-z-wave-with-wifi-and-poe/">Wi-Fi and PoE experimental firmware</a>).</p>
<p>Home Assistant Yellow was similarly groundbreaking at launch and helped fund Home Assistant’s development. However, for reasons I’ll explain below, the time has come to end production. This means that if you were considering buying a Home Assistant Yellow, you’ll need to act fast, as stock will not be replenished (check the <em>Order Now</em> button on the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow">Home Assistant Yellow page</a> to see if your local retailer still has stock).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nabucasa.com/">Nabu Casa</a> is now exploring what hardware could replace Home Assistant Yellow, so if you have any suggestions on what we should do next, <strong>please</strong> <strong>tell us in the comments!</strong> In the meantime, the good news is that there are already <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/">plenty of other great ways to run Home Assistant</a>. For example, if you’re looking for hardware that’s both easy to start with and supports the Open Home Foundation, we’d recommend the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/green">Home Assistant Green</a>.</p>
<h2>A golden era <a name="a-golden-era" href="#a-golden-era"></a>
</h2>
<p>There is a long yellow brick road that brought us to today. All the way <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPR-shzT_VQ">back in 2021</a>, we announced Home Assistant Yellow (originally called Amber). It included some pretty unique features, including its built-in Zigbee or Thread adapter, optional PoE, and overall expandable approach. As it used the Raspberry Pi Compute Module platform, included GPIO, and had an NVMe slot, there were a lot of different ways you could upgrade it over time (including people <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/11/27/home-assistant-yellow-gets-cm5-support/">being able to upgrade from CM4 to CM5</a>, which was quite the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/home-assistant-yellow-instant-2x-iot-speedup-cm5">speed bump</a> ).</p>
<p>It wasn’t all smooth sailing with Home Assistant Yellow. We essentially launched the device in the middle of the great Pi shortage. It definitely complicated things for a time, but it all eventually stabilized. In late 2023, we launched <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/green">Home Assistant Green</a>, which became the easiest way to get started with Home Assistant. This new product led us to <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/08/01/streamlining-the-home-assistant-yellow-lineup/">end the sale</a> of Home Assistant Yellow devices that shipped with a CM4 already installed (called the <em>Home Assistant Yellow Standard</em>), which allowed us to focus the product line on the kit versions.</p>

</p>
<p>Home Assistant Green continues to have strong sales, but Home Assistant Yellow sales have been naturally slowing down, as happens a couple of years into any product’s life. This month, it finally reached the point where it no longer made sense to have another production run, which ultimately pushed us to discontinue Home Assistant Yellow.</p>
<p>Technology changes, and small-form-factor computing has always moved fast. For instance, in the early days of Home Assistant, the community’s de facto recommendation was always the most recent Raspberry Pi device, but we’re seeing more people gravitate towards Mini PCs. We’re now exploring what we could build next for our power users, but we’re still some way off, so don’t wait if you need something today.</p>
<h2>Software support continues <a name="software-support-continues" href="#software-support-continues"></a>
</h2>
<p>As long as it’s possible to run Home Assistant on Yellow, we will continue to provide builds. If you want living proof of this commitment, take our first hardware device: Home Assistant Blue. It ended production in 2022, but still receives new builds of Home Assistant, something that shows no signs of changing for a long time. We continue to streamline and make Home Assistant more efficient, as it’s our goal for you to run it on the hardware you have.</p>
<h2>Say ‘ellow to the future <a name="say-ellow-to-the-future" href="#say-ellow-to-the-future"></a>
</h2>
<p>I’d just like to take a moment to thank everyone who bought a Home Assistant Yellow over the years, and for all the great feedback you shared with us. We’re sad to say goodbye to our trusty little expandable powerhouse, but it’s had a good run and we’re super proud of how far we’ve come. Also, we’ll soon be announcing the date of our next hardware product (not a computing device… but something very cool nonetheless), so stay tuned!</p> </article> </div></div>

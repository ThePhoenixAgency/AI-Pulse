    <div><div><p>When you hand your API keys to an AI agent hosting provider, you're trusting them with a lot. Your credentials. Your data. The ability to send emails and messages on your behalf. If something goes wrong — a data leak, an unauthorized action, a surprise bill — it's your problem, not theirs.</p><p>The challenge is that <strong>evaluating this risk is hard.</strong> Most providers describe their security using terms like “enterprise-grade encryption” or “bank-level security” — phrases that sound reassuring but tell you nothing. To actually understand what's protected and what isn't, you'd need to be a security engineer. That's not right.</p><p>We built BestClawHosting because we believe <strong>every user should be able to understand their exposure to risk</strong> without needing a technical background. Today we're shipping a completely rebuilt scoring system designed around that principle.</p><h2>Start with what users actually care about</h2><p>Our original scoring model looked at six infrastructure dimensions — isolation, access control, network security, and so on. It was technically sound, but it had a problem: <strong>those aren't the words people use when they're worried about their agent.</strong></p><p>Nobody lies awake thinking about “network segmentation.” They think: <em>can someone else see my data? Can my agent go rogue? What happens if I get a massive bill I didn't expect?</em></p><p>So we started over. The new model has <strong>10 risk categories</strong>, each framed as a plain-language question:</p><ol><li><strong>Can anyone else see my data?</strong></li><li><strong>Can someone take over my agent?</strong></li><li><strong>Are my keys and passwords safe?</strong></li><li><strong>Can my agent do things I didn't authorize?</strong></li><li><strong>Can I lose my data or get locked out?</strong></li><li><strong>Will I get unexpected bills?</strong></li><li><strong>Who's responsible when something goes wrong?</strong></li><li><strong>What if a tool or dependency gets compromised?</strong></li><li><strong>Is the platform itself secure?</strong></li><li><strong>Can I trust what my agent tells me?</strong></li></ol><p>These aren't arbitrary. Each one maps to real threats documented across multiple security frameworks — OWASP Agentic Security, OWASP Top 10, OWASP LLM Top 10, NIST CSF 2.0, and CIS Controls. But we deliberately frame them as questions because <strong>the starting point should always be the user's concern, not the framework's taxonomy.</strong></p><h2>Trust what you can verify</h2><p>Scoring how well a provider addresses each risk is only half the picture. The other half is: <strong>how do you know they actually do what they say?</strong></p><p>Every score comes with an evidence grade:</p><ul><li><strong>Verified</strong> — confirmed by a third-party audit, open-source code, or independent testing</li><li><strong>Documented</strong> — specific technical details published on their site</li><li><strong>Claimed</strong> — mentioned in marketing language without specifics</li><li><strong>Unknown</strong> — not addressed anywhere we could find</li></ul><p>This matters because the AI agent hosting market is young. Many providers are moving fast, and security pages — when they exist — tend to be vague. A provider that documents exactly how they isolate your data earns more credit than one that simply says “your data is secure.” And if a provider doesn't mention something at all, we don't assume the best — we mark it unknown.</p><p>This isn't about punishing providers. It's about giving you an honest picture. If a provider is doing great work but hasn't documented it yet, they can always share more details and their score will improve. Transparency benefits everyone.</p><h2>Where we are today</h2><p>We've re-scored all 42 providers from scratch against the new model. Most currently fall in the Basic range — not because they're doing bad work, but because the market is early and detailed security documentation is still rare. We expect this to change as the space matures.</p><p>The scores you see on each provider page now show 10 risk cards, each answering one of the questions above. You can see at a glance where a provider is strong, where they're weak, and — critically — where the evidence is thin.</p><h2>Fully transparent</h2><p>Everything about how we score is public. The <a href="https://www.bestclawhosting.com/methodology">full methodology</a> documents every mitigation we look for, how evidence grades work, and which security controls map to each category. If we got something wrong, we want to know.</p><p>Our goal is simple: <strong>help you make an informed choice about who you trust with your AI agent</strong> — without needing to become a security expert first.</p></div></div>

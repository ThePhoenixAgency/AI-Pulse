<p>Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares opened the week under pressure and closed lower on Friday trading. The stock hit a low near <strong>$255.45</strong> and was last quoted at <strong>$255.78</strong>, down about <strong>2.3%</strong> on the session. This move came after a previous close at <strong>$261.73</strong> and reflected heavier trading, with around <strong>55 million shares</strong> changing hands, slightly above average volume.</p>



<p>Investors have seen volatility in Apple’s price over the past weeks. After climbing earlier in February to levels near <strong>$278</strong>, the stock retraced, driven by profit-taking and broader tech pressure. Recent trading data shows swings within a range from roughly <strong>$260 to $280</strong> before Friday’s decline.</p>



<h2>What Is Driving the Price Move</h2>



<p>Recent headlines have influenced how traders view Apple stock:</p>



<ul>
<li>Apple’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-stock-drops-5-percent-after-siri-delay-report-and-ftc-scrutiny/">stock dropped sharply</a> on one session, marking one of its worst days this year.</li>



<li>Concerns on delays to its AI-driven services, especially the Siri upgrade, have weighed on sentiment.</li>



<li>A broader selloff in tech shares has kept pressure on Apple and peers.</li>
</ul>



<p>Analysts point to a mix of fundamental and sentiment-driven forces. Product strength and revenue remain substantial, but uncertainty about AI integration timelines has eroded some confidence in the share price.</p>



<h2>Key Price and Volume Figures</h2>



<p>Here are the notable price figures around Apple stock today:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Closing price Friday</strong>: $255.78</li>



<li><strong>Intra-day low</strong>: ~$255.45</li>



<li><strong>Recent four-week high</strong>: Near $278</li>



<li><strong>52-week range</strong>: Approx. $169 to $289</li>



<li><strong>Trading volume</strong>: ~55 million shares (higher than average)</li>
</ul>



<p>These figures show that while Apple remains well above long-term lows, it has pulled back from recent highs.</p>



<h2>Market Context and What to Watch</h2>



<p>Tech markets influence Apple’s movement every session. The broader “Magnificent Seven” group, including Apple, has seen volatility tied to debates over growth and AI spending.</p>



<p>Investors will likely watch the following catalysts:</p>



<ul>
<li>Updates on Apple’s AI and Siri rollout plans</li>



<li>Quarterly earnings and forward guidance</li>



<li>Broader tech sector trends</li>



<li>Major product launches or supply chain shifts</li>
</ul>



<p>These elements can affect how traders and longer-term holders price AAPL in the weeks ahead.</p>

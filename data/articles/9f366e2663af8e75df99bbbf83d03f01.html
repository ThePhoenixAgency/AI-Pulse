    <div><div><p>A former politician accused of sexually abusing a young teenager in a car park bathroom has said he did not know the boy was 13 years old when they met.</p><p>Rory Amon talked to the alleged victim on a gay dating app and then over Snapchat before meeting at the boy’s family home on Sydney’s northern beaches.</p><p>The former state MP has pleaded not guilty to various criminal sexual acts against the teenage boy in 2017 and faced a NSW supreme court jury trial on Friday.</p><p>Then aged in his mid-20s, Amon initially spoke with the boy on a gay hook-up website after the teen lied about his age to sign up for a free trial, the crown prosecutor, Meaghan Fleeton, told jurors.</p><p>Amon and the boy, who was in year 8 at high school, did not use their real names. They allegedly met on two occasions in June and July 2017 at the teen’s apartment where he lived with his parents.</p><p>The sexual activity took place in a communal bathroom connected to the car park, Fleeton said.</p><p>At the first meeting, Amon is accused of placing the boy’s hand on his genitals and then directing the boy to have sexual intercourse with him.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p><p>On the second occasion, he brought along a towel which was placed onto the floor.</p><p>Further alleged sexual assaults took place while the pair were standing and then while they lay down on the towel.</p><p>Amon attempted to have sexual intercourse with the teen before telling him to perform another sexual act.</p><p>On both occasions, the former councillor left first.</p><p>The boy waited a few minutes alone before going upstairs to his home, Fleeton told the jury.</p><p>The complainant, who cannot be legally named, then blocked Amon on Snapchat.</p><p>He told his teacher, psychiatrist, parents and friends in 2017 about what allegedly happened. But the teen did not make a formal complaint to police until years later after Amon became a local councillor and the boy realised his real identity.</p><p>Amon was arrested and charged in August 2024.</p><p>Now aged 36, the former politician has pleaded not guilty to 10 charges, including five counts of having sexual intercourse with a child and two counts of attempted sexual intercourse with a child.</p><p>He also denies indecent assault charges.</p><figure></figure><p>Amon admits meeting the teenager on a gay dating app but it may have been different to the one the Crown alleges was used, his defence barrister, Matthew Johnston SC, told jurors.</p><p>The former MP also admitted talking with the teen on Snapchat before going to his home.</p><p>But Amon denied he knew the boy was 13 years old, as anyone who signed up for the dating website had to be aged over 18.</p><p>“At no point in time did [the alleged victim] provide Amon with his real age,” Johnston told the jury.</p><p>Instead, the 36-year-old had an honest and reasonable belief that the complainant was at least 16-years-old, the jury heard.</p><p>“That is an innocent state of mind,” Johnston said.</p><p>The alleged victim is expected to tell the court he said he was at least 15 years old.</p><p>Amon also disputed meeting up with the teen twice, saying he only went to the apartment block on one occasion, Johnston said.</p><p>The trial continues.</p><figure></figure></div></div>

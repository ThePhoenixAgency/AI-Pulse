    <div><div><p>A former NSW MP’s alleged abuse victim has pushed through tears while testifying in court.</p><p>Rory Amon, 36, has pleaded not guilty to various criminal sexual acts against a teenage boy in 2017 and faced a NSW Supreme Court jury trial on Friday.</p><p>Then aged in his mid-20s, the former state MP spoke with the 13-year-old boy on a gay hook-up website after the teen lied about his age to sign up for a free trial, crown prosecutor Meaghan Fleeton told jurors.</p><p>Amon and the high school student, who was in Year 8, did not use their real names.</p><p>They spoke on Snapchat before allegedly meeting on two occasions in June and July 2017 at the teen’s apartment where he lived with his parents.</p><p>The sexual activity took place in a communal bathroom connected to the car park, Fleeton said.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p><p>During his evidence, the alleged victim - who cannot be legally named - started sobbing and placed his head in both hands when shown police photographs of the bathroom.</p><p>Now 22, the man told the court he was excited and giddy at meeting Amon, thinking this was the precursor to something romantic.</p><p>At the first meeting, the older man wore grey tracksuit pants, a white Adidas hoodie and ugg boots. After leading the teen into the bathroom, he flushed the toilet and made a comment about the smell before sitting on the floor, the jury was told.</p><p>The ex-MP is then accused of placing the boy’s hand on his genitals and then directing the boy to have sexual intercourse with him.</p><p>The complainant’s voice cracked when Fleeton asked him to describe the allegations in explicit detail.</p><p>“Do I have to?” he asked.</p><p>“Yes,” the prosecutor replied.</p><p>On the second occasion, further alleged sexual assaults took place while the pair were standing and then laying on a towel brought by Amon. The older man allegedly attempted to have sexual intercourse with the teen before telling him to perform another sexual act.</p><p>The complainant told the court he felt grossed out and repulsed by what was happening. “I wanted it to stop,” he told the jury.</p><p>On both occasions, the former MP left first.</p><p>The boy waited alone before going upstairs to his home, Fleeton told the jury.</p><p>The complainant blocked Amon on Snapchat after the former MP and lawyer tried to arrange a third meeting.</p><p>He told his teacher, psychiatrist, parents and friends in 2017 about what allegedly happened.</p><figure></figure><p>In disclosing what allegedly happened to a friend, he said he told Amon he was 15 years old.</p><p>The teen did not make a formal complaint to police until years later after Amon became a local councillor and the boy realised his real identity.</p><p>In 2022, Amon sent messages to the alleged victim online, including a photograph of himself wearing a fireman’s outfit.</p><p>He was arrested and charged in August 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to 10 charges including five counts of having sexual intercourse with a child and two counts of attempted sexual intercourse with a child.</p><p>He also denies indecent assault charges.</p><p>Amon admits meeting the teenager on a gay dating app, defence barrister Matthew Johnston SC told jurors.</p><p>The former MP also admitted talking with the teen on Snapchat before going to his home.</p><p>But Amon denied he knew the boy was 13 years old, as anyone who signed up for the dating website had to be aged over 18.</p><p>“At no point in time did (the alleged victim) provide Mr Amon with his real age,” Johnston told the jury.</p><p>Instead, the ex-councillor had an honest and reasonable belief that the complainant was at least 16-years-old, the jury heard. “That is an innocent state of mind,” Johnston said.</p><p>Amon also disputed the teen’s account, saying he only went to the apartment block once, Johnston said.</p><p>The trial continues on Monday.</p><figure></figure></div></div>

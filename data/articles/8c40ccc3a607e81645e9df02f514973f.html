CME, the go-to platform for hedge funds and institutional desks in the U.S., shows traders are still paying a premium to stay long on bitcoin, according to NYDIG’s head of research, Greg Cipolaro.</p><div><p><span>STORY CONTINUES BELOW</span></p></div><p>This is evident on a one-month annualized basis, essentially the markup for futures over spot prices, which remains higher than on its offshore counterpart, Deribit. </p><p>“The more pronounced drop in offshore basis suggests reduced appetite for leveraged long exposure,” Cipolaro wrote. “The widening spread between CME and Deribit basis functions as a real-time gauge of geographical risk appetite.”</p><p>Bitcoin earlier this month fell to $60,000 before rebounding. Some pinned the selloff on rising concerns that quantum computing will undermine the system's cryptographic security. NYDIG found that the numbers don’t back up that explanation.</p><p>For one, bitcoin’s performance has closely tracked that of publicly traded quantum-computing companies like IONQ Inc. (IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS). If quantum risk were truly weighing on crypto, those stocks would be rising while bitcoin falls.</p><p>Instead, they dropped together, pointing to a broader decline in appetite for long-term, future-driven assets. On top of that, search data on Google Trends shows interest for “quantum computing bitcoin” rises when the price of BTC rises.</p></div><div><p><span>AI Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethics">our standards</a>. <span>For more information, see </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2023/04/14/how-coindesk-will-use-generative-ai-tools">CoinDesk's full AI Policy</a>.</p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>Hive, Riot earnings reports, Fed rate-decision minutes: Crypto Week Ahead</p><div><p>57 minutes ago</p></div><figure><img alt="Federal Reserve logo highlighted on a U.S. banknote (joshua-hoehne/Unsplash/Modified by CoinDesk)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2Faa140510763159a9c00f0230ff84f4f675e733d6-1920x1080.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" /></figure><p>Your look at what's coming in the week starting Feb. 16.</p><div><p>What to know: </p><div><p>You are reading Crypto Week Ahead: a comprehensive list of what's coming up in the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain in the coming days, as well as the major macroeconomic events that will influence digital asset markets.

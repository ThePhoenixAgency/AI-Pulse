The question is only for the Russians: what do they want?"</p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, Russia's state RIA news agency quoted a source saying that Tuesday's negotiations, which lasted six hours, had been tense and took place in different bilateral and trilateral formats. </p></div><div><p>The talks are being mediated by Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump's special envoy, and Jared Kushner, the US president's son-in-law.</p></div><div><p>On the Russian side, President Vladimir Putin's aide Vladimir Medinsky is the top negotiator.</p></div><div><p>Both Ukraine and Russia also had senior military figures in their teams.</p></div><div><p>Ahead of the talks, Trump said Ukraine had "better come to the table fast."</p></div><div><p>He has previously signalled his impatience with the lack of swift progress in solving the four-year conflict. </p></div><div><p>Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including large parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over the rest of the region, which Ukraine has ruled out. </p></div><div><p>For Ukraine, robust security guarantees from the West - including the US - must come before any settlement with Russia can be agreed.</p></div><div><p>In Kyiv, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybhiha condemned the overnight Russian strikes, saying they showed the "extent to which Russia disregards peace efforts".</p></div><div><p>At least three energy workers were killed near the frontline city of Slovyansk in Monday's overnight attacks, Ukraine's deputy Energy Minister Artem Nekrasov said. </p></div><div><p>A further nine people - including children - were injured across the country, President Zelensky said. More than 10 residential buildings were damaged, with railway infrastructure also damaged. </p></div><div><p>"Russia must be held to account for its aggression," he wrote on X, adding: "For peace to be real and just, action must target the sole source of this aggression".</p></div><div><p>Kyiv said 12 regions were hit, damaging infrastructure and leaving thousands without power in the southern port city of Odesa. </p></div><div><p>DTEK, the country's largest private energy firm, said power infrastructure in the city had suffered "incredibly serious" damage, adding it would take a long time to return to a working condition. </p></div><div><p>Ukraine is facing an acute energy crisis after months of relentless Russian attacks on its infrastructure and as it struggles through a freezing winter. </p></div><div><p>It launched its own volley of attacks on Russia overnight. Officials said a fire broke out at the Ilsky oil refinery in the southern Krasnodar region after a drone strike. A reservoir storing oil products also caught fire.</p></div><div><p>The border region of Belgorod continued to come under attack, with Ukraine launching dozens of drones and causing significant damage of power infrastructure. </p></div><div><p>These latest discussions follow <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyr6p30054o">last month's trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi</a>, which were the first three-way between Russia, Ukraine and the US since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.</p></div><div><p>They ended with no breakthrough - although the first prisoner of war exchanges in months took place shortly after.</p></div><div><p><i>Additional reporting by Jaroslav Lukiv</i></p></div></article></div></div>

<p>The Russian government is trying to block WhatsApp in the country as its crackdown on communication platforms outside its control intensifies.</p>


<p>WhatsApp announced the action against it on X, calling it “a backwards step” that “can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.”</p>


<p>WhatsApp assured its Russian users that it will continue doing everything it can to keep them connected.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/politics/12/02/2026/698d78079a7947ffe922a0e8" target="_blank">Russian media</a>, the country’s internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor, had recently excluded the domains <em>whatsapp.com</em> and <em>web.whatsapp.com</em> from the National Domain Name System, citing the official explanation of countering crime and fraud.</p>


<p>In practice, excluding the domains from domestic DNS routing made WhatsApp services accessible only to users who use VPN tools or external resolvers.</p>


<p>However, more aggressive measures are reportedly now in place, with the latest attempt to fully block WhatsApp in Russia. The instant messenger's parent company, Meta, has been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63218095" target="_blank">designated as an “extremist” entity</a> in Russia since 2022.</p>


<p>WhatsApp saw its first restrictions in the country in August 2025, when Roskomnadzor began <a href="https://tass.com/economy/2001779" target="_blank">throttling voice and video calls</a>. In October 2025, the authorities attempted to <a href="https://kod.ru/telegram-i-whatsapp-bez-sms" target="_blank">block new user registrations</a>.</p>


<p>Presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/politics/12/02/2026/698d07dc9a794741239bc1fb">reportedly stated that</a> the authorities are open to allowing WhatsApp to resume operations in the country, provided that Meta complies with local legislation.</p>


<p>WhatsApp blocks came shortly after similar action was taken against Telegram, which was <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2026/02/russia-slowing-down-of-telegram-messaging-app-another-blow-for-freedom-of-expression/" target="_blank">reportedly aggressively throttled</a> earlier this week in Russia.</p>


<p>Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, responded to the situation by stating that Russia is trying to encourage its citizens to use the Kremlin-controlled MAX messenger app.</p>


<p><a href="https://x.com/durov/status/2021300047531389021" target="_blank"><img alt="Durov" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2026/February/durov.png" /></a></p>


<p>MAX is a controversial communications platform developed by VK, which <a href="https://t.me/government_rus/23209" target="_blank">became mandatory</a> on all electronic devices sold in the country since September 2025.</p>


<p>Although MAX is promoted as a secure app that safeguards national communications from foreign surveillance, several independent reviewers have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-app-max-data-privacy-concerns-whatsapp-kremlin-china/" target="_blank">raised concerns</a> about encryption weaknesses, government access, and extensive data-collection risks.</p>


<p>For now, users in Russia may be able to continue accessing their messengers of choice by using VPN tools, though those <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/russia-forces-apple-to-remove-dozens-of-vpn-apps-from-app-store/" target="_blank">are not immune</a> to the government’s crackdown either.</p>

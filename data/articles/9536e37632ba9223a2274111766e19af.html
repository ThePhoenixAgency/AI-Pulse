    <div><div><p>People with major depressive disorder can see a rapid and lasting improvement after a single dose of the psychedelic drug dimethyltryptamine (DMT) when it is combined with psychotherapy, doctors have said.</p><p>A small clinical trial involving 34 people found that psychedelic-assisted therapy prompted a swift reduction in depressive symptoms that endured long after the drug had worn off, with some still feeling the benefits six months later.</p><p>“There is an immediate antidepressant effect that is significantly sustained over a three-month period and that’s exciting because this is one session with a drug, embedded in psychological support,” said Dr David Erritzoe, a psychiatrist at Imperial College London and lead investigator on the trial.</p><p>Although preliminary, the results add to a growing body of evidence that psychedelic drugs, when coupled with psychotherapy, could help to alleviate depression in the millions of people worldwide who do not respond to existing antidepressants or therapies.</p><p>An estimated 100 million people worldwide have treatment-resistant depression, defined as a major depressive disorder that has not responded to at least two antidepressants. About half are unable to perform routine daily tasks.</p><p>The trial, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04154-z">reported in Nature Medicine</a>, focused on people with moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression. One half received a single 21.5mg dose of DMT infused into a vein over 10 minutes. The other half received a placebo infused the same way. All of the participants had psychotherapy and follow-up assessments.</p><p>Patients given DMT improved significantly compared with the placebo group, as measured by scores on a standard depression questionnaire, with the antidepressant effects lasting from three to six months.</p><p>DMT is an active ingredient of the ayahuasca brew used in shamanistic rituals in South America. The drug induces powerful and often mystical hallucinogenic trips that can alter people’s sense of time and space, dissolve their sense of self, and conjure up meetings with <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.720717/full">otherworldly beings</a>.</p></div></div>

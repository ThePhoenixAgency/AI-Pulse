<div> <div><p>The Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Camera is a chunky gadget that takes the place of a standard rear-view mirror and, be warned, it might to too big for some vehicles. Its front and rear cameras capture excellent video, and being able to change views in the sizable electronic mirror display is a boon. Despite copious cables, fitting is relatively easy. This type of dash cam makes sense if you drive an older vehicle that would benefit from some modern driver aids, many of which come as standard in later models. This also means that owners of newer cars might find some of the features and functionality here are surplus to requirements.</p> </div>

<h3><span>Miofive Mirror 1: two-minute review</span></h3><div><p>While I’ve tried plenty of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/dash-cams/the-best-dash-cams" target="_blank">best dash cams</a> on the market, I’ve spent less time using one of the alternatives – a mirror dash cam, such as the Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Cam. It's a chunky hunk of kit, being designed to fit over a standard issue rear view mirror, using one of three different mounting options. It can be strapped, stuck or screwed on, but no matter which option is employed, the result is the same – this is a large gadget.</p><p>The Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Cam differs from traditional offerings in the design department, but it’s actually a refreshing variation on the theme. This gadget delivers the same functionality found on a traditional dash cam but everything is presented slightly differently.</p></div><p>The Miofive Mirror 1 comes with an impressive specification, and sizable price tag. There are twin Sony sensors for the cameras; a 4K (3840 × 2160 30fps) IMX415 Starvis 2 for the front and a 2K (2560 × 1440 30fps) IMX675 for the rear unit, capable of capturing crips footage for regular day time driving as well as after dark scenarios – these sensors have proven performance characteristics. What they see is also presented on the mirror screen, which is an expansive 11.26-inch modestly curved display that features anti-glare capabilities.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WEZJB2hVbSbPhPyw2bGHKC.jpg" alt="Miofive Mirror Dash Cam">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><div><p>As a premium device, the Miofive Mirror 1 also boasts excellent connectivity features, including 5GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2, which means moving those high-resolution files is quick and easy – Miofive says up to 7MB per second, while data itself can be managed by an accompanying no frills Miofive app.</p><p>The Miofive Mirror 1 dash cam also packs sophisticated and in vogue AI-driven driver assistance features and functions, which are all easily accessed via the touchscreen. These include warnings for abrupt acceleration or braking, lane departure and ‘Stop and Go’ traffic movement.</p><p>Along with those bang-up-to-date features, the Miofive Mirror 1 comes with everything needed to keep it running. There’s a super capacitor-based power supply plus the unit can be powered off a 12V socket or, if preferred, hardwired to exploit its functionality more comprehensively. Hardwire features include the 24-hour parking monitor aspect.</p></div><p>Miofive also packs a 128GB microSD card into the mirror’s media slot so, aside from some wiring chores initially, the unit is pretty much ready to go.</p><h3><span>Miofive Mirror 1: price and availability</span></h3><p>The Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Camera currently costs $299.99 on <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0F6L9R6YJ%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-us-1455939628095401440-20" target="_blank">Amazon</a> in the US. Meanwhile, the Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Camera is also available to buy from <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB0F6L8WC7K%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-21%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-us-8706528921428003741-21" target="_blank">Amazon UK </a>for £259.99, at the time of writing. Normally, the regular UK list price is £299.99, which is comparable to other likeminded mirror dash cam models with similar specs. Cheaper mirror dash cam alternatives can be found too, but I think the quality of construction makes the Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Cam seem like decent value.</p><h3><span>Miofive Mirror 1: specs</span></h3><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><caption>Miofive Mirror specs</caption><tbody><tr><td><p>Video</p></td><td><p>Front: 4K UHD (3840×2160p) @30 fps<br>Rear: 2K QHD (2560×1440p) @30 fps</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Field of view (FOV)</p></td><td><p>140 degrees front / 140 degrees rear </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Storage</p></td><td><p>MicroSD up to 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>GPS</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Parking mode</p></td><td><p>Yes, with constant power cable, not included</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>App support</p></td><td><p>Miofive app</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dimensions</p></td><td><p>‎31 x 7 x 2 cm / 12.2 x 2.76 x 0.79 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weight</p></td><td><p>1.01 lbs / 498g </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Battery</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h3><span>Miofive Mirror 1: Design</span></h3><div><p>While the ample screen real estate offered by the Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Cam, which has overall dimensions of 2.2 x 2.76 x 0.79 inches / 31 x 7 x 2 cm, is impressive, its size should be kept in mind by anyone with a smaller windscreen. In a compact or small sports car, the 11.26-inch IPS touchscreen might feel a little bit too obtrusive. Even in a larger vehicle, such as an SUV, the mirror construction is bulky. However, it looks and feels nicely designed and reasonably durable.</p><p>The same can be said for all of the various accessories and ancillary components needed to get the Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Cam installed and operating. Miofive offers three different ways to mount the mirror unit, which is essentially stuck in place over an existing rear-view mirror. I chose the rubberised strap method which worked well, didn’t vibrate or move on the go and was temporary enough to let the unit be removed from my test vehicle.</p></div><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ip4ZD4dzjiKEfJg7ZNZP4c.jpg" alt="Miofive Mirror Dash Cam">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><div><p>A more permanent option is using the supplied screws to fasten it in place, while bonding is another long-term method. I suggest using the rubberised strap method initially, just in case the Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Cam isn’t quite the right fit for your needs. The box contains all the other wiring and connectors needed to hook up to the power, including a 12V plug for that port and colour coded harnessing for connecting peripherals. </p><p>The peripherals include a small rear-view camera, which can be stuck in place using a sticky pad on the camera's base and subsequently angled for optimal capture. The other accessory that requires connection to the crop of wires is the GPS unit. Everything is basically finished in grey or black plastic, while most of the cabling is black too. This can be fed behind trim using the usual method just like any other dash cam. There’s just a little more to hide away.</p></div><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pJk3BDKy4Cvi47iHQYQuRW.jpg" alt="Miofive Mirror Dash Cam">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h3><span>Miofive Mirror 1: Performance</span></h3><div><p>Once I had all of the wiring plumbed in, the Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Cam was actually very simple and straightforward to set up. The media card was already in the slot, and I followed best practice and formatted the card following initial power up. From there, the mirrored screen area displayed an array of small icons, plus a split view. To the left was a view of the read ahead and to the right, a view to the rear of the car. I left it in this default mode for testing purposes although views can be tweaked to suit individual preferences. </p><p>The picture quality looks less good in my photos but, in reality, the quality of the lenses was easy to see with clear and sharp images from each angle even in decidedly gloomy conditions. Miofive has done a decent job of including a solid level of control options, via screen icons when the cameras are on. This meant it was easy to tap and change anything, such as brightness, before setting off.</p></div><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9aPfFoQMS8hXdhYc65z4f.jpg" alt="Miofive Mirror Dash Cam">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><div><p>Dipping into the other features and functions – which include Connect Your Phone, Recording Settings, Parking Guard, AI, System Settings, About and Speed Cam Alert –required more thought, but the large color icons worked well. The AI menu option brings up five different functions that can be enabled and set for intensity, like Reverse Assist Line, for example, which is set as Medium by default. These are okay, although I didn’t feel a desperate urge to use them. In fact, Driver Assistance, as one option, is better off disabled as far as I’m concerned. </p><p>Overall, the footage recorded by the Miofive Mirror 1 Dash Cam is largely excellent. It's crisp and clear, capturing details nicely enough, and didn’t leave me wanting anything better. The detail presented along the bottom of the footage, including date, time and speed is also perfectly acceptable. Used as a pure front and rear dash cam setup, this is a very good product. And, should you require them, there are plenty of neat tools to enhance the functionality.</p></div><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2ELfcZgJQ7kcDWzTo8gph.jpg" alt="Miofive Mirror Dash Cam">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One important thing to note is anyone wanting to enjoy the parking monitoring will need to do so by <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/dash-cams/i-hardwired-my-dash-cam-and-its-unlocked-so-many-new-features-here-are-three-reasons-why-you-should-too">enlisting the services of an optional hardwire kit</a>. This does increase the potential of the bundle, especially for anyone wanting the extra parking features that get unlocked by going down the hardwire route.</p><h3><span>Should you buy the Miofive Mirror 1?</span></h3><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AcRZ9nUDG9tjBopLkKFeAm.jpg" alt="Miofive Mirror Dash Cam">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Buy it if...</h2><h2>Don't buy it if...</h2><h3><span>How I tested the Miofive Mirror 1</span></h3><ul><li><strong>I installed the dash cam in a car for an initial period of three to four weeks</strong></li><li><strong>I used it for various day and night journeys in all types of weather</strong></li><li><strong>I connected it to my phone, downloading recordings to check on quality</strong></li></ul><p>I tested the Miofive Mirror 1 dash cam across a period of several weeks. This involved using it in a test vehicle and during a variety of weather conditions. This allowed me to try all of the features and functions, aside from the hardwire options due to it being powered via a 12V power port in a vehicle that was on temporary loan.</p><p>On top of that, I downloaded the latest Miofive app, which was installed on an iPhone 17 and used during the installation process and also for file management duties. I also tested the Wi-Fi connectivity between the main camera unit and the app, which based on the size of the 4K video files was a big part of the overall testing procedure and everything worked as anticipated.</p><ul><li><em><strong>First reviewed February 2026</strong></em></li></ul>

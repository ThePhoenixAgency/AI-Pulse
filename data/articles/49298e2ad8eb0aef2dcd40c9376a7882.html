<p>Both statements verified that the integration never launched and that no Ring customers’ videos were ever sent to Flock.</p>
<p>Ring did not credit users’ privacy concerns for its change of heart. Instead, they <a href="https://blog.ring.com/about-ring/ring-and-flock-cancel-partnership/">claimed</a> that a joint decision was made “following a comprehensive review” where Ring “determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.”</p>
<p>Separately, Flock<a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/an-update-on-ring-partnership"> said</a> that “we believe this decision allows both companies to best serve their respective customers and communities.”</p>
<p>The only hint that Ring gave users that their concerns had been heard came in the last line of its blog, which said, “We’ll continue to carefully evaluate future partnerships to ensure they align with our standards for customer trust, safety, and privacy.”</p>
<p>Sharing his views <a href="https://x.com/jsrailton/status/2022114029565583424">on X</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jsrailton.bsky.social/post/3mepeumg6rs2r">Bluesky</a>, John Scott-Railton, a senior cybersecurity researcher at the Citizen Lab, joined critics calling Ring’s statement insufficient. He posted an image of the ad frame that Markey found creepy next to a statement from Ring, writing, “On the left? A picture of mass surveillance from #Ring’s ad. On the right? A ring [spokesperson] saying that they are not doing mass surveillance. The company cannot have it both ways.”</p>
<p>Ring’s statements so far do not “acknowledge the real issue,” Scott-Railton said, which is privacy risks. For Ring, it seemed like a missed opportunity to discuss or introduce privacy features to reassure concerned users, he suggested, noting the backlash showed “Americans want more control of their privacy right now” and “are savvy enough to see through sappy dog pics.”</p>
<p>“Stop trying to build a surveillance dystopia consumers didn’t ask for” and “focus on shipping good, private products,” Scott-Railton said.</p>
<p>He also suggested that lawmakers should take note of the grassroots support that could possibly help pass laws to push back on mass surveillance. That could help block not just a potential future partnership with Flock, but possibly also stop Ring from becoming the next Flock.</p>
<p>“Ring communications not acknowledging the lesson they just got publicly taught is a bad sign that they hope this goes away,” Scott-Railton said.</p>

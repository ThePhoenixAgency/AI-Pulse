          <p>Autonomous vehicles have a lot of potential. As long as you program them right, they won’t speed, won’t break traffic laws, and won’t get drunk, high, abusive, or violent. And the technology has been getting much more capable, even as some of the hype has died down, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/12/seeing-no-road-to-profit-gm-shutters-cruise/">taking some</a> of the related companies <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/self-driving-startups-are-becoming-an-endangered-species/">with it</a>. Waymo still easily leads the field and is already operating commercially in six cities across America, with a dozen more (plus London) coming soon. Waymos can even drop you off and pick you up at the airport in Phoenix and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Soon, Waymo will begin deploying its sixth-generation Waymo Driver, using upfitted Zeekr Ojai minivans, adding to the Jaguar I-Paces that have become so common on San Francisco streets and to its fleet of Hyundai Ioniq 5 electric vehicles. It has upgraded the cameras, lidar, and radar, meaning the cars can better sense their environments at night and in inclement weather. There are even microphones that can pick up sounds like sirens to better inform the robotaxi of the direction the emergency vehicle(s) are coming from.</p>
<p>But even with all these advances since the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2015/05/googles-quirky-self-driving-bubble-car-hits-public-roads-this-summer/">pod-like two-seater</a> that predates even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/12/google-spins-out-self-driving-car-unit-now-called-waymo/">the Waymo name</a>, there are still a few things that remain beyond a robotaxi’s capabilities. Like closing a door a passenger left open on their way out. All the sophisticated sensors and high-powered computer processing in the world are useless if the car can’t move until the door closes and there’s no one there to give it a hand.</p>

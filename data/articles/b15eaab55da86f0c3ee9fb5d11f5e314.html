    <div><div><article><p><time>Thursday February 19, 2026 3:26 am PST</time> by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/tim-hardwick/">Tim Hardwick</a></p><div><p>Apple's upcoming March 4 media event could include a demo of immersive Formula 1 content on Apple Vision Pro, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/18/immersive-f1-vision-pro-spitball"><em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber</a> has suggested.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/ymahcc3bIplSu3J5uWtpOP6gL28=/400x0/article-new/2025/10/Apple-exclusive-F1-partner.jpg?lossy" alt="Apple exclusive F1 partner"><br>The timing appears to be what's sparked the idea. The 2026 F1 season <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/official-grand-prix-start-times-for-2026-f1-season-confirmed.2UgPfArqH76tzlOYh21jSG">kicks off in Australia on March 8</a>, just four days after the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/">Apple Experience</a>" set to be held in New York, London, and Shanghai. </p>
<p>Apple became the exclusive U.S. broadcast partner for Formula 1 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/17/apple-announces-partnership-with-formula-1-for-exclusive-coverage/">last October</a>, and the company has already been experimenting with live immersive sports on Vision Pro with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/05/los-angeles-lakers-vision-pro/">limited slate of Los Angeles Lakers games</a> this season. If Apple has plans to stream F1 races live on Vision Pro with some level of immersion, March 4 would likely be a great opportunity to show it off to the press.</p>
<p>To be clear, there are no little birdies tweeting into Gruber's ear on this one – he's quick to acknowledge this is pure speculation shared with him by a reader. "Could just be a total coincidence that the Formula 1 season is starting the weekend after this event," he says. "But it seems worth noting."</p>
<p>Apple has said that further details on production and "new ways to enjoy F1 content" across its products will be shared in the coming months. March 4 could fit that timeline nicely, or it could of course be nothing at all.</p>
<p>Apple is widely expected to unveil several new products in the near future, including the iPhone 17e, MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, an eighth-generation iPad Air, and a 12th-generation iPad. A refreshed Studio Display and an all-new low-cost MacBook powered by the A18 chip are also possible, alongside updates to the Apple TV and HomePod mini.</p>
<p>The "Apple Experience" could include announcements for some of these products, alongside hands-on opportunities for media with the new devices around the world. The event is set to begin at 9:00 a.m. ET on March 4, 2026.</p>

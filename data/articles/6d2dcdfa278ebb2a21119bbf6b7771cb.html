</figure></div> <div> <p>There are all sorts of news sources around, in both website and app form, but some are a whole lot better than others.</p><p>And by better, I mean both more reputable and a better reading experience – be that through the writing quality or how well laid out the site or app is.</p><p>Here, I won’t be looking at sites, but I will be looking at some of my favourite news apps that are available on Android, and which can be found listed in no particular order below.</p><h2><span>1. Google News</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PmCp5TEnEGHZWyLMHmyPLn.jpg" alt="Google News marketing images">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.magazines&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Google News</a> is probably one of the most well-known news apps on Android, since it’s <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/google">Google</a>’s own offering, and there’s a good chance therefore that it’s one you’ve tried before – but if not you really should.</p><p>Of course, Google doesn’t do its own news reporting – instead you’ll find stories from all sorts of other global news sources included in the app.</p><p>The various stories are sorted into categories, including local news, nationwide, world, business, tech, and more, and if there are any news sources or topics that you don’t want to see, you can hide them in a few taps, allowing you to tailor the Google News experience to your liking.</p><h2><span>2. BBC News</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Rg6r5StSg4DumvFFZVhLn.jpg" alt="BBC News marketing images">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: BBC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite some claims to the contrary, the BBC is arguably one of the least biased news sources in the English-speaking world, so if you want to avoid too much bias in your coverage, then it’s a good choice.</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><p>Its reporting is obviously more UK-focused than some news sources, but there’s lots of world news included too, so it’s worth considering even for those outside the UK.</p><p>As far as the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bbc.mobile.news.uk&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">BBC News</a> app goes, it lets you choose the topics and stories you care about, for a curated experience, and it offers alerts for top stories, plus all the same reporting you’ll get on the BBC News site, including both UK and world news, local news and weather for UK residents, live news, breaking news, and analysis.</p><h2><span>3. Reuters</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B8vgYXrcdiDRUaZ7x43oDn.jpg" alt="Reuters marketing images">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Thomson Reuters)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thomsonreuters.reuters&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Reuters</a> is another news source that tries as much as possible to avoid bias, and it’s also one of the most factually accurate sources. In fact, it has won the Pulitzer Prize numerous times for its reporting, so it’s a top-tier choice.</p><p>As for the app, you can create a customized feed based on your interests, view videos, listen to podcasts, receive customized push notifications for the content you care about, and read all of Reuters' prize-winning reporting.</p><p>And Reuters operates globally, so its coverage doesn’t feel overly focused on a specific country – though of course you can tailor your feed to just focus on your home country if you prefer.</p><h2><span>4. Readly</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qudCND5imYRvH2C5YJqwEn.jpg" alt="Readly marketing images">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Readly International)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readly.client&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Readly</a> houses news from numerous different outlets, so in that sense it’s more like Google News than Reuters or BBC News. But specifically it houses newspapers, which you can read digital versions of through the Readly app.</p><p>Of course, newspapers aren’t typically free, and nor are they here, but you can access thousands of them for a single monthly fee.</p><p>As such, another way in which this differs from the apps above is that it’s a paid experience, but if there’s a newspaper you like and you’d rather have it in digital form, or perhaps can’t easily get the paper version where you are, then there’s a good chance Readly has access to it.</p><p>And you’re not limited to newspapers – your subscription fee also gives you access to thousands of magazines, such as Forbes, The Week, Rolling Stone, Newsweek, and many more.</p><p>Back issues are available too, and with the Readly app you can download these newspapers and magazines, so you can read them later even if there’s no internet connection.</p><h2><span>5. Ground News</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qBASvVUBh9mJVDxC4UFDtm.jpg" alt="Ground News marketing images">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Snapwise Inc.(dba Ground News))</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.checkitt&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Ground News</a> is another news aggregator, so a bit like Google News, and it has access to over 50,000 news sources. Rather than attempting to be unbiased in itself like Reuters, it instead shows you the bias and reliability of every news source it uses, along with information on the ownership of each source, so you can see more clearly what biases might be at play.</p><p>For each individual story it will also highlight what percentage of sources covering it lean left, right, or remain central, and will show which stories are blind spots for each side.</p><p>For each story you’ll be able to see AI-powered summaries along with links to the articles themselves, and with around 60,000 stories added every day, there’s a lot of content.</p><p>So if you want a clearer perspective on the impact bias can have in media, while making sure you see all sides of a story, then Ground News is a good place to start. However, while you can access some content for free, much of it requires a subscription.</p><hr><p><em></em><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

Here are the details.</p> <h2>Book-type foldables have been on the rise, but Apple might help accelerate that shift</h2> <p>If the latest rumors are correct, Apple is expected to present a book-type (rather than a clamshell-type) foldable iPhone towards the end of the year.</p> <p>The device is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/12/16/heres-everything-expected-from-next-years-iphone-fold/">expected</a> to feature a 5.5-inch outer display and a 7.8-inch inner display, with an aspect ratio similar to Apple’s largest iPads, per a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/12/16/iphone-fold-will-be-more-wide-than-tall-when-unfolded-per-report/">recent report by <em>The Information</em></a>.</p> <p><a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/Book-Type-Devices-to-Reach-of-Global-Foldable-Smartphone-Shipments-in-2026">According to Counterpoint Research</a>, this will help book-type foldables reach 65% of total foldable shipments in 2026, up from 52% in 2025.</p> <figure><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/02/counterpoint-research-foldables-2026.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt=""></figure> <p>Based on Counterpoint’s data, Samsung has led the book-type foldable market since 2020, with the exception of 2024, when Huawei topped shipments for the category.</p> <p>Here’s why Apple is poised to play such a meaningful role, per the report:</p> <blockquote>
<p>This design direction underscores a clear focus on productivity-driven use cases rather than form-factor experimentation. While market outcomes will depend on variables such as pricing, launch timing and product positioning, Apple’s entry is expected to materially influence leadership dynamics within the book-type foldable segment and accelerate broader market adoption.</p>
</blockquote> <p>And here’s Counterpoint Research Associate Director Liz Lee:</p> <blockquote>
<p>“As book-type foldables gain traction, differentiation will increasingly depend on software experience and ecosystem readiness. In this context, Apple’s expected entry reinforces the industry-wide convergence toward book-type foldables across OEM strategies and ecosystems.”</p>
</blockquote> <p>As is the case with many forward-looking reports on the smartphone market, Counterpoint Research notes that the recent memory supply shortage is also a contributing factor in why the market may put a greater focus on book-type, rather than clamshell foldables.</p> <p>Here is Research Director Tarun Pathak</p> <blockquote>
<p>“As memory supply tightness becomes increasingly concentrated in components used for low- to mid-range smartphones, concerns around the broader mass-market outlook are growing. (…) Against this backdrop, OEMs are placing greater emphasis on higher-value devices, prioritizing profitability over volume. Book-type foldables are well-positioned in this shift, as their premium specifications and higher memory configurations support ASP (average selling price) expansion while aligning with value-led growth strategies.”</p>
</blockquote> <p>In other words, as long as memory supply remains tight, phone makers will probably prioritize higher-margin foldable devices, rather than focusing on volume.</p> <p>Interestingly, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/01/apple-considering-clamshell-style-foldable-iphone-flip/"><em>Bloomberg</em> recently reported</a> that Apple is also considering a clamshell-type foldable iPhone, although there is no expected timeline for when it would hit the shelves:</p> <blockquote>
<p>Now there’s another foldable device under consideration inside Apple labs: a square, clamshell-style foldable phone.</p> <p>The product is far from guaranteed to reach the market. Still, Apple is betting that its first foldable iPhone will be successful enough to generate real demand for the category and that customers will want additional shapes and sizes, much as they have with traditional slab-style iPhones.</p>
</blockquote> <p>Be that as it may, while expectations that Apple’s entry into foldables could bring more attention to the category aren’t new, today’s report puts a number on how much it might help move the needle for book-type devices in 2026.</p> <p>To read Counterpoint Research’s full report, <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/Book-Type-Devices-to-Reach-of-Global-Foldable-Smartphone-Shipments-in-2026">follow this link</a>.</p> <h4>Accessory deals on Amazon</h4> <ul>

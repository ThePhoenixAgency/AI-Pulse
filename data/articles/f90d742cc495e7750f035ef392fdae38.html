    <div><div> <p>The French government on Tuesday survived two ​votes of no-confidence in parliament over its decision ⁠to ram through the expenditure part of the 2026 budget without giving the National Assembly, France's lower house, the final say.</p> <p>A total of 267 ​lawmakers in the National Assembly voted in favour of the no-confidence motion presented by the hard-left <a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france-unbowed/">France Unbowed</a> party together with the Greens and Communists, whereas ​289 votes were required to bring down the government.</p> <p>​Only 140 lawmakers backed a second no-confidence motion, brought by the <a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/far-right/">far right</a>&nbsp;National Rally party.</p> <p>The motions came days after Prime Minister <a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/s%C3%A9bastien-lecornu/">Sébastien Lecornu</a> weathered two separate, largely symbolic no-confidence challenges on Friday, triggered by his decision to ram through the income section of the 2026 state budget without a parliamentary vote.</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260123-french-pm-lecornu-survives-first-of-two-no-confidence-votes">French PM forces budget through parliament after surviving two no-confidence votes</a></p> <p>He then announced he would do the same with the expense part of the budget, prompting the hard left to file another no-confidence motion.</p> <p>The National Assembly on Tuesday rejected that motion, along with a separate one tabled by the far right.</p> <p>Lecornu on Tuesday defended his decision, touting what he called a "breakthrough" budget that would boost defence spending by €6.5 billion ($7.78 billion) and urging a "long-term" view.</p> <p>The bill must now be reviewed by the upper house before returning to the lower house National Assembly for final adoption.&nbsp;</p> <p>He will have to use the same constitutional power to force the whole bill into law, which will expose him to more no-confidence votes.</p> <p>The decision to use the constitutional tool known as Article 49.3 marked an about-face for Lecornu, who pledged last year to seek parliament's approval, in a bid to avoid the fate of his two predecessors who were ousted over budget negotiations.</p> <p>The eurozone's second-largest economy has been bogged down in political crises since Macron called a snap poll in 2024, in which he lost his parliamentary majority.</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AFP and Reuters)</em></p> </div></div>

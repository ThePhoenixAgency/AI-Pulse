<h2><span>Asus ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless: one-minute review</span></h2><p>The Asus ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless is a controller compatible with both Xbox Series X|S and PC. It’s an unabashedly premium product at $189.99 / £199 / AU$349 but, for that price, it’s wonderfully responsive, beautifully designed and comes with a good array of accessories.</p><p>First off, the Raikiri II feels beautifully well built. It feels solid and substantial, yet it’s ergonomically designed. Elements like the rear buttons are perfectly placed under your fingertips to make them easy to access without shifting your grasp, while its textured grips meant it never once slipped in my hands. Its RGB lighting is also tastefully done, just subtle enough to not detract from its sleek appearance and coming with plenty of customizable options.</p><p>Both the thumbsticks and shoulder triggers are staggeringly accurate, thanks to Asus’s decision to use TMR sensors in each of them. Not only do I relish not having to worry about the dreaded stick drift anymore but I found them astoundingly precise, giving me spot-on control over everything from acceleration in racing games to aiming in FPSes. The fact that the shoulder triggers can be toggled to using micro-switches is just the icing on the cake – smashing parries out against the Paintress in <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> has never felt so satisfying to me.</p><p>This awesome sensitivity and precision is further supported by the Raikiri II’s blisteringly fast connectivity, which rivals that of many of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/the-best-xbox-controllers-in-2023">best Xbox controllers</a>. Not only does it offer an absurdly rapid 1,000Hz polling rate but its 2.4GHz wireless connection and USB-C connectivity each trim input latencies down to just 3.5ms and 2.3ms. Naturally, it also offers Bluetooth connectivity but, honestly, I found the former options so fast that I’d opt for those every time.</p><p>Thanks to Asus’s Gear Link software, you can also customize a lot of the Raikiri II’s functionality. On top of basic options like button remapping, you can also set discreet response curves and deadzones for each thumbstick, as well as start and end points for each of the shoulder triggers. There’s also the option to tweak how intense the controller’s rumble settings are and map the pad’s four rear buttons to various functions.</p><p>While you can save all of these settings to one of five profiles, this does come with a pretty serious caveat. When playing on Xbox, you can only switch between them using the Gear Link software, meaning hooking it up to your laptop or desktop each time. To me, this feels like a pretty major oversight – can you really class this Raikiri II’s Xbox edition, if a key part of the functionality is inaccessible to Xbox gamers?</p><p>This one misstep aside though, the Asus ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless is a seriously impressive controller. While I think PC gamers will get even more out of it than those on Xbox, it’s still a fantastically responsive pad on either platform, offering some features I’ve not seen on many other products, like those TMR triggers. Yes, it’s relatively pricey at $189.99 / £199 / AU$349 but, if you’re looking for a trailblazing premium controller, it’s a great option.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iPhmEKfyJyEG5jtuyaw2aE.jpg" alt="A closeup of the left side of the Asus ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless, showing its left thumbstick and D-pad.">

You can pick it up for $189.99 / £199 / AU$349, putting it firmly up the premium end of the Xbox controller market.</p><p>In return for that spend, though, you get a whole heap of functionality, plus a range of connectivity options: Bluetooth, a 2.4GHz wireless dongle or wired USB-C connectivity. On top of this, it also comes with a carry case, USB-C cable, charging dock and replacement thumbsticks, so it’s a very decent package for the price.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o2qp8R4nvrmhcn7fBgkqbE.jpg" alt="The Asus ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless and its dock sat on a stone-effect surface.">

</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Asus ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless review: design and features</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Long-lasting TMR sticks</strong></li><li><strong>Excellent dual-mode triggers</strong></li><li><strong>Attractive, ergonomic design</strong></li></ul><p>Over the years, I’ve built up quite the grisly mausoleum of dead controllers, both Xbox and otherwise. Eventually, the dreaded stick drift has claimed every single one. So it’s a relief to know that won’t happen with the ROG Raikiri II’s drift-resistant thumbsticks.</p><p>Asus has opted for TMR sticks here, which it says are not only more accurate but consume less power than Hall-effect alternatives. While it’s difficult to assess what kind of longevity you’ll get out of them, from the second I held the ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless in my hands, the thumbsticks felt incredibly responsive and enabled me to make surgically precise movements in a variety of games.</p><p>But perhaps even more than the Raikiri II’s thumbsticks, I really fell for its dual-mode shoulder triggers. When set to their micro-switch triggers, I found they were lightning fast to activate, making them perfect for hammering the trigger in FPS games. Meanwhile, their full-range TMR sensor mode is a real rarity on console controllers – we’ve certainly not tested many with that functionality here at TechRadar Gaming – and it gave me really wonderfully precise control for games like <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a>.</p><p>At first, I found the clicky feedback of the micro-switch face buttons took a little getting used to, as I’m more familiar with the spongy softness of the Xbox Wireless Controller buttons. But once I’d adapted to their novel feel, I was fully converted – they activate seriously quickly and offer such an immediate response that you know almost instantly when you’ve hit your target.</p><p>Its extra rear shortcut buttons are perfectly placed, sitting right under where your middle and ring fingers naturally grab the pad. And they’re wonderfully versatile. Not only are they great if you want to set up extra macros in game but being able to set a couple as shortcuts for the shoulder buttons saved me ever having to switch my grip during sessions of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, which reduced my response times in game significantly.</p><p>When it comes to looks, the controller styles itself after the recent <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gaming-computers/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Xbox ROG Ally X</a>, riffing off design elements like its subtle decal. It also mimics its textured grips, which I definitely found made it easier to keep hold of the pad without them ever feeling rough. In fact, its matt plastic build always feels pleasantly tactile to the touch, while the whole device feels just substantial enough to avoid flimsy or hollow.</p><p>And while I know that for some people RGB lighting on a controller is an unnecessary gimmick, I have to admit that I’m completely suckered in by the ROG Raikiri II’s lighting. Partly this is because it’s relatively subtle and restrained, limiting itself to a strip down either side and the central ROG button, and it’s fully customizable, allowing you to decide quite how much you want to lean into full-blown esports styling.</p><p>Finally, the ROG Raikiri II has an impressive range of connectivity options. On top of Bluetooth, it also has 2.4GHz wireless connectivity via a dongle and a USB-C wired connection. These latter two are particularly impressive, offering an 1,000Hz polling rate and trimming input latencies to just 3.5ms and 2.3ms respectively, meaning you should easily get the drop on most of your enemies in game.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HVBi74UHeTmWp4rFz2wsZE.jpg" alt="A closeup of the right side of the Asus ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless, showing its right thumbstick, D-pad and face buttons.">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Asus ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless review: performance</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Blisteringly fast response times</strong></li><li><strong>Brilliantly customisable</strong></li><li><strong>Custom profiles can’t be changed on Xbox</strong></li></ul><p>With its 1,000Hz polling rate in PC mode, it’s safe to say I was expecting the Raikiri II to respond to inputs rapidly. And it did not disappoint. Even when playing fast-paced FPSes like <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-review"><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em></a>, I couldn’t detect the least hint of lag over its low-latency 2.4GHz RF connectivity or USB-C cable.</p><p>But it’s not only its connectivity that make for lightning fast gaming – those dual-mode shoulder triggers are a literal game-changer. When I first tried them out while playing <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, the difference compared to my previous budget controller was immediately appreciable. Especially when using them in their micro-switch trigger mode, I suddenly found myself going from fumbling three-quarters of parries to nailing them 80% of the time. Those triggers respond <em>fast </em>and I certainly found it had a palpable impact on my game play.</p><p>And with Asus’s Gear Link software you can tweak things even further to get the kind of performance you need for each game you’re playing and save them to one of five customized profiles. You can access this tool by hooking up the Raikiri II to your PC and accessing it in your browser.</p><p>This method does come with an unfortunate wrinkle, however. As it's browser-based, there’s no way to access it on the fly from your Xbox and the controller doesn’t offer any way to switch between profiles as you play. That means you can only ever access one tuning at a time on your console before you need to return to a PC to switch things up – which is a weird choice to make for a controller that literally has ‘Xbox’ in the name.</p><p>Honestly, that’s a bit of a shame as, otherwise, the Gear Link<strong> </strong>software offers really granular control over the responsiveness of your controller. For example, I was able to set one of my profiles with very quick response and shallow range for its triggers, making it really easy to fan the hammer when trying to gun down opponents on <em><a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>: Modern Warfare 3</em>. Conversely, for <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, I set the right trigger to activate over its full range, giving me really precise control over the throttle so I could better manage my speed during cornering.</p><p>And that’s just the beginning. You can also set independent custom curves for each of the TMR thumbsticks, enabling you to tweak how fast they respond the further they’re moved, as well as set the size of their deadzones. While playing <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/doom-review-1321626"><em>Doom</em></a>, I set the left stick to have a rapid curve and kept the right one set as linear – as a result, I was able to close the gap between Doom Guy and all those demons far quicker, without having the camera whip round too violently.</p><p>The Gear Link software also unlocks a bunch of other customization options. You can change the intensity of the controller’s vibration haptics, which I imagine is very useful for people who have sensory processing problems or find it difficult to grip on to a controller that’s vibrating too fiercely.</p><p>It also unlocks some aesthetic tweaks for that RGB lighting. You have the option to set each zone up separately, whether you want it in solid color, breathing, reacting to button presses or color cycling. My personal go-to though? It definitely has to be battery mode, which allows you to set the lighting to specific colors for different battery levels – I can now get a precise sense of how much juice my pad has left at just a glance, which is a lifesaver.</p><p>Overall, I found the performance of the Asus ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless to be seriously impressive. Don’t get me wrong: there are some odd choices along the way, especially the lack of a hotswap button for saved profiles on the Xbox. But if you’re not flipping through different genres at the drop of a hat or you’re playing on PC, it's an incredibly responsive controller with a great level of customizability.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wmtDqvveK5mCwNWYKaVqbE.jpg" alt="The Asus ROG Raikiri II Xbox Wireless sat in its case, alongside a USB-C cable and spare thumbsticks.">

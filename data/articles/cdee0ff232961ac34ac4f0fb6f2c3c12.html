<p><strong>Key Insights (AI-assisted):</strong><br />
The alignment of a 3GPP-compliant cellular chipset vendor with an NTN operator signals that satellite links are moving from niche add-ons to integral elements of mainstream IoT designs. Embedding Skylo support at the silicon and module level lowers integration friction for OEMs, potentially shifting demand away from proprietary satellite terminals toward standard cellular form factors. Joint certification efforts also hint at an emerging de facto baseline for hybrid terrestrial–non-terrestrial SKUs across verticals such as logistics, utilities, and asset tracking. This development reinforces the broader trend of converged, standards-based terrestrial and satellite connectivity in the IoT stack.
</p>
<h2>The companies are collaborating to expand seamless global satellite connectivity for next-generation cellular IoT devices, including joint efforts towards chip and module certification</h2>
<p>GCT Semiconductor Holding, Inc. (“GCT” or the “Company”), a leading designer and supplier of advanced 5G and 4G semiconductor solutions, and Skylo Technologies, Inc, a global Non-Terrestrial Network provider spanning 36 countries across 70 million square kilometers of coverage, today announced a partnership to advance next-generation satellite connectivity.</p>
<p>As part of this collaboration, the companies will jointly pursue chip and module certification to enable a new class of multi-use devices. These devices will allow customers to have ubiquitous connectivity by connecting to Skylo’s network when terrestrial connectivity is out of reach.</p>
<p><em>“This partnership marks another significant step in GCT’s commitment to powering the rapidly expanding 5G-to-space ecosystem,”</em> said John Schlaefer, CEO of GCT. <em>“We’re excited to deepen our collaboration with Skylo and to help accelerate the next generation of global satellite connectivity for customers and device-makers worldwide.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Our collaboration with GCT is a critical milestone in making global connectivity truly seamless,”</em> said Vijay Krishnan, VP of Strategy Partnerships of Skylo. <em>“By integrating GCT’s 3GPP-compliant silicon with Skylo’s satellite network, we are eliminating the traditional boundaries of cellular coverage.”</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This isn’t just a technical proof of concept; it’s a demonstration of ready-to-scale ecosystem that brings reliable, standards-based IoT connectivity to the most remote corners of the globe. We are proving that ‘always-on’ isn’t a luxury – it’s the new standard for global industry.”</p>

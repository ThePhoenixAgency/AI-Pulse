						<p>Seems like the component shortages thanks to AI may have finally hit Valve as in the US, Canada and Asia all models of Steam Deck are completely out of stock.</p>
<p>It's been like it for a few days now, which is the first time this has happened in quite some time since the original rush after release. Valve said previously once the 256GB LCD model went out of stock they wouldn't be making any more, so we already expected that. But with the OLED also out of stock, that's perhaps a tiny bit alarming.</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6742210221770894557gol2.webp" /></p>
<p>Looking around — in the UK <em>all</em> models are still in stock. And using a VPN to quickly check a few other places only the LCD appears to be sold out in Europe. For Asian regions, Komodo are also listing all Steam Deck models as out of stock.</p>
<p>This won't be the end of the road for the Steam Deck, at least I <em>doubt</em> so because that would be incredibly abrupt for it to just be over with all the work Valve has put into it but it does bring some questions. Will Valve, like other companies, be forced to raise prices? Considering the age of the device now and how it struggles to run most new bigger games, would that even make sense?</p>
<p>Valve have already had to delay any pricing and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/02/steam-machine-steam-frame-faq-ram-and-storage-crisis-to-blame-for-no-pricing-or-dates/" target="_blank">release info for the Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a>, so we shouldn't really be surprised the Steam Deck is now facing issues too.</p>
<p><em>I've shot off a mail to Valve press to see if they have anything to say about it.</em></p>

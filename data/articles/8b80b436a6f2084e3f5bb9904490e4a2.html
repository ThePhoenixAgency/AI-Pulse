    <div><div><p>Stani Kulechov, the founder of the decentralized lending platform Aave, says DeFi could benefit from $50 trillion worth of “abundance assets,” such as solar energy, through tokenization by 2050, opening a new class of onchain collateral.</p><p><a href="https://app.rwa.xyz/" target="_blank">Data</a> from RWA.xyz shows that nearly $25 billion worth of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ant-digital-puts-8b-energy-assets-blockchain">real-world assets have been tokenized</a> onchain, but they are mostly in the form of US Treasury bonds, stocks, commodities, private credit and real estate. </p><p>In a post to X on Sunday, Kulechov <a href="https://x.com/StaniKulechov/status/2023079479493452013" target="_blank">said</a> he expects these scarce assets to continue growing but that the “biggest impact from tokenization can be achieved by tokenizing abundance assets.”</p><p>“Capital is hungry for new collateral, and the world is ready for a transformation that onchain lending can capture and accelerate,” the Aave Labs boss said, while adding that solar could account for $15-$30 trillion of the $50 trillion “abundance asset” market by 2050.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c64cd-7d50-7918-ab04-ad9c3e4c5062.png" /><figcaption><em>Source: </em><a href="https://x.com/Melt_Dem/status/2023197129284694280" target="_blank"><em>Meltem Demirors</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Kulechov said solar debt financiers could <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ant-digital-puts-8b-energy-assets-blockchain">tokenize a $100 million solar project</a> while borrowing $70 million to redeploy into new projects, while onchain depositors would have “access to enormously scalable, low-risk yield that is well diversified.”</p><p>“An investor might buy tokenized solar, hold for three years, sell at a profit, and immediately redeploy into new development,” Kulechov added, arguing that such a model could significantly increase capital efficiency.</p><blockquote>“Traditional infrastructure capital locks up for decades. Tokenized assets allow continuous trading, meaning the same dollar can finance multiple projects over time.”</blockquote><p>Kulechov said the same idea extends to batteries for energy storage, robotics for labor, vertical farming and lab-grown food for nutrition, semiconductors for computation and 3D printing for materials.</p><h2>Abundance assets could offer better returns</h2><p>Kulechov said these abundance assets could offer higher returns than scarce assets, which he said are heading down “a road toward low, thin margins and diminished profitability.”</p><blockquote>“Abundance-backed products offer better returns, better risk characteristics, and better values alignment. They win in the market because they are superior products.”</blockquote><p>Aave is the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/makerdao-aave-defi-conflict-dai-risk">largest DeFi protocol</a> by total value locked, at <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/de-fi-lender-aave-breaks-all-time-high-tvl">$27 billion for borrowing and lending, </a>DeFiLlama <a href="https://defillama.com/" target="_blank">data</a> shows.</p><p>The Tether-issued USDt (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index">USDT</a>) stablecoin, Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH</a>) and wrapped Ether (wETH) are the most <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/maple-finance-stablecoins-aave-lending-markets">lent and borrowed assets</a> on the platform.</p><h2>AAVE down 15.2% in 2026</h2><p>Aave’s native token Aave (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/aave-price-index">AAVE</a>) has not managed to stave off the recent crypto market slump, falling another 1.6% over the last 24 hours, CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aave" target="_blank">data</a> shows.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/aave-shuts-down-avara-family-wallet-refocus-defi"><em><strong>Aave winds down Avara, phases out Family wallet in DeFi refocus</strong></em></a></p><p>AAVE has fallen 15.2% so far in 2026 to $125.98 and is now 81% off its $661.70 all-time high set in May 2021.<br /></p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c64cd-836f-75a7-bb50-62bf326d81ec.png" /><figcaption><em>AAVE key metrics and price changes over the last month.

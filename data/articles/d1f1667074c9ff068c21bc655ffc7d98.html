</p><p>The previous <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos-26">macOS 26.2</a> came with new features that were visible to users, such as urgent Reminders and the all new Edge Light illumination for video calls. It also gave M5 Mac users a giant machine-learning <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/11/18/macos-tahoe-262-will-give-m5-macs-a-giant-machine-learning-speed-boost">speed boost</a>.
</p><p>This new macOS 26.3 is also optimized for the M5, but reportedly that is specifically for the M5 Pro and M5 Max. The forthcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro modes have been said to be tied to the release of macOS 26.3.
</p><p>That's not unusual, as each version of macOS does get preinstalled on the next Macs to be launched after them. But that can just be because the new macOS becomes the default, and in this case it's claimed that there is more.
</p><p>The suggestion is that the new MacBook Pro requires macOS 26.3 to operate. That would mean that there are more changes and improvements to the release than are apparent so far.
</p><p>Otherwise, the new macOS 26.3 has no visible new features. For once, Apple's beta test notes didn't even include the usual reference to performance and security updates.
</p><p>There have been security updates, though. Unusually, Apple did not wait for the next scheduled beta release of macOS 26.3, but instead pushed the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/08/ios-263-and-macos-tahoe-263-betas-get-second-background-security-updates">security update</a> early. That update is now included in this public release.
</p><p>Beyond that, it has been expected that macOS 26.3 might include features or changes required by the European Union. It's also probable that all macOS Tahoe features have been at least considered for revision, whether they then had minor improvements or not.
</p><p>Nonetheless, wherever you are, it is important to update to the latest version of macOS specifically for security reasons. <em>AppleInsider</em> will always recommend you update — though we also say you should wait a couple of days first.
</p><p>That's so that other users can discover any problems with the release, and Apple has time to fix them.
</p><p>Note, too, that while Apple has released macOS 26.3, it may take some time for it to roll out worldwide. If a Mac is compatible, then at some point it will prompt users to update.
</p><p>But that may not happen for some time, potentially even weeks. So if users are not already prompted to update, they can request the download by going to <strong>System Settings</strong> on their Macs, then <strong>General</strong>, and lastly <strong>Software Update</strong>.
</p><p>The macOS 26.3 build number is 25D125.</p> </div> </article> </main> </div></div>

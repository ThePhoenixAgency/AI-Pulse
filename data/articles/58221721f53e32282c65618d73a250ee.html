Manus, a Meta-acquired AI startup, has launched "Manus Agents" to bring full-scale AI reasoning and task execution directly into messaging apps like Telegram. Pradeep Viswanathan Neowin @pradeepviswav · Feb 16, 2026 11:16 EST The popularity of OpenClaw has revealed that personal AI agents are the next big thing in the world of AI. To join the trend, Manus, which was recently acquired by Meta, has announced Manus Agents, a new way to access Manus directly inside messaging apps. OpenClaw is an exciting idea, but it requires complex setup, regular maintenance, and unpredictable costs. Even though it became popular among the geek community, general consumers will not be able to set up and use it easily. Manus Agents is trying to solve this problem. To create a personal agent on Manus, users should go to the Agents tab in the Manus workspace and click connect. Then, they can scan the QR code that appears from their mobile phone and start messaging the agent from the supported messaging apps. The Manus team highlighted that this is not a lightweight chatbot add-on; instead, it offers full Manus capabilities, including reasoning, multi-step task execution, and tools. Here’s what you can do with a Manus personal agent on messaging apps: Launch multi-step tasks and get results delivered directly inside the chat. Send voice messages, photos, and documents to the agent for transcription, image editing, and more. Set the agent’s personality by selecting from concise, structured, or more conversational options. Select the AI model powering the chat. You can select Manus 1.6 Max for deeper reasoning or Manus 1.6 Lite for faster tasks. Manus Agents is now available inside Telegram for all Manus users across all subscription tiers. Manus has plans to bring Agents to more messaging platforms, including Messenger, in the coming weeks. A Manus co-founder tweeted that big updates are coming over the next 30 days, including the ability to create your own specialized agents and plug them into any group chat, support inside new messaging apps including WhatsApp, LINE, Slack, and Discord very soon, native Windows and Mac apps, the ability for Manus to operate your PC, and more.</p></div>

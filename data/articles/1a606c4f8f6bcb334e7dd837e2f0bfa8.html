    <p>Macworld For the past decade, my Apple Time Capsule has faithfully backed up my Mac. I’ve been through several upgrades over the past decade—my current machine is an M3 Max MacBook Pro—and I’ve never had an issue with my Time Capsule. It’s been one of the most reliable devices I’ve ever owned, and I’ve barely had to even think about it since I bought it in 2016.
Until recently, that is. I don’t know the exact date, but I installed macOS Tahoe 26.2 sometime near the end of 2025. I was hoping it would fix the lingering issues I had with Spotlight, but otherwise didn’t think much of it until I got a message from Time Machine telling me my backup disk was full.
I’ve had occasional minor issues with Time Machine backups over the years, but they’ve usually been fixed by simply running the backup again. This was a new persistent error that seemed to indicate something was actually wrong with my backup system. So I started to investigate the issue, and the process ended up bricking my Time Capsule.</p>

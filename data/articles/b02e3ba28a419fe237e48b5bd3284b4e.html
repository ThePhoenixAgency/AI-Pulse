Van Rootselaar died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. </p></div><div><p>The shooting was one of the deadliest in Canadian history. </p></div><div><ul><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e4nvyjwnno">Canada summons OpenAI senior staff over Tumbler Ridge shooting</a></li><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rjg9ddgkqo">Who were the victims of the shootings in Tumbler Ridge, Canada?</a></li></ul></div><div><p>Canadian officials met OpenAI senior staff earlier this week in Ottawa, after the company revealed it had shut down a ChatGPT account used by the suspect in June 2025 for violating usage terms.</p></div><div><p>That account was not reported to police, however, because it did not at the time meet its threshold for "credible and imminent planning" of serious violence, the company said.</p></div><div><p>In its letter to Canadian officials on Thursday, penned by OpenAI's vice-president of global policy and shared with media outlets, the company said it had implemented a series of changes in recent months, including enlisting the help of "mental health and behavioural experts" to assess cases and making the criteria for referral to police "more flexible". </p></div><div><p>Because of the changes, OpenAI said it would have reported the suspect's ChatGPT account under the new guidelines.</p></div><div><p>The letter does not specify when those new protocols took effect.</p></div><div><p>The company also revealed that the suspect was able to create a second account, despite being flagged by OpenAI systems in the past. That second account was shared with police after the shooting, it said.</p></div><div><p>"We commit to strengthening our detection systems to better prevent attempts to evade our safeguards and prioritize identifying the highest risk offenders," the company wrote.</p></div><div><p>OpenAI said it will also establish a direct point of contact with Canadian law enforcement so it can quickly flag any possible future cases with "potential for real world violence". </p></div><div><p>That direct line of communication is one of the requests made by Canadian officials following their meeting with OpenAI staff on Tuesday.</p></div><div><p>Canada's AI minister Evan Solomon said on Friday that while legislators saw a willingness by the tech firm to improve its protocols, "we have not yet seen a detailed plan for how these commitments will be implemented in practice".</p></div><div><p>Solomon also opened the door for future legislation on the matter if OpenAI fails to implement changes quickly. He will meet Altman next week. </p></div><div><p>British Columbia Premier David Eby has said he believes the shooting would have been prevented if the company had alerted police to Van Rootselaar's account months ago.</p></div><div><p>"They tragically missed the mark in [not] bringing this information forward. The consequences of that will be borne by the families of Tumbler Ridge for the rest of their lives," Eby told reporters on Thursday.</p></div><div><p>Eby added that OpenAI Sam Altman has agreed to meet to discuss the company's safety policies. </p></div><div><p>"I think it's important that Mr Altman hear about how his team's decision not to bring this information forward has resulted in devastation," he said.</p></div></article></div></div>

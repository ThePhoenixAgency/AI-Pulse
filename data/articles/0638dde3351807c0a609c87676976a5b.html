    <div><div><p>XRP (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>) recovered 50% to a high of $1.67 from its 15-month low of $1.12 reached on Feb. 6. While the altcoin’s intraday price of $1.43 remains more than 60% below its multi-year high of $3.66, several metrics suggest that the local low at $1.12 could be the new bottom with XRP price set for a sustained recovery.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><p>XRP supply on exchanges has dropped to a five-year low as holders moved tokens to self-custody, possibly signaling reduced selling pressure.</p></li><li><p>Funding rates are at extreme lows, suggesting a potential bottom.</p></li><li><p>Positive spot taker CVD, and steady ETF inflows signal strong buyer and institutional demand for a rebound.</p></li></ul><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6cb0-6182-79bc-adc4-67723ed258fe.png"><figcaption><em>XRP: Price drawdown from all-time highs. Source: Glassnode</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Falling XRP supply on exchanges is bullish</h2><p>There has been a notable decline in the XRP supply held on exchanges over the past two years, as indicated by data from Glassnode.&nbsp;The XRP balance on exchanges dropped to 12.9 billion XRP on Tuesday, matching with levels last seen in May 2021.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6cb0-672e-7e70-90ac-a1b6897e3fd6.png"><figcaption><em>XRP balance on exchanges. Source: Glassnode</em></figcaption></figure><p>A falling token balance on exchanges suggests a lack of intention to sell by holders, possibly reinforcing the future upside potential for XRP.&nbsp;</p><p>Additional data from CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/69933369312550148f4ebbf1-Can-XRP-Rise-While-Reserves-Are-Falling" target="_blank">reveals</a> that Binance’s XRP reserve has dropped sharply to around 2.57 billion XRP, with both the SMA(50) and SMA(100) sloping downward.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/xrp-analysts-why-price-drop-below-1-dollar-possible"><em><strong>XRP analysts explain why price drop below $1 ‘remains possible’</strong></em></a></p><p>“Technically, reserves are declining while price remains near the lows,” said CryptoQuant contributor PelinayPA in a Monday Quicktake analysis.</p><p>This structure increases the probability of a potential short squeeze scenario ahead.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6cb0-725f-7750-8847-38ef433ecf72.png"><figcaption><em>XRP reserve on Binance. Source: CryptoQuant</em></figcaption></figure><h2>XRP funding rates fall to extreme lows</h2><p>Binance funding rates fell to -0.028% as the price dropped to $1.12 on Feb. 6, the lowest level since April 2025. Combined with falling spot prices, negative funding rates reflect overcrowded shorts and capitulation among leveraged longs.&nbsp;</p><p>Historically, extreme negative funding often signals a potential bottom or short squeeze, as the market becomes oversold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similar funding conditions in April 2025 preceded a 65% rally to $2.65, from $1.60, as shorts were squeezed out.</p><figure> <img alt="Cryptocurrencies, XRP, Markets, Price Analysis, Market Analysis, Altcoin Watch, ETF" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6d0e-1710-70e9-841d-a42dc5f6935f.png"><figcaption><em>XRP ledger funding rates. Source: CryptoQuant</em></figcaption></figure><p>Comparable setups in late 2024 triggered sharp upside moves as traders rushed to close positions.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, XRP <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-open-interest-in-the-crypto-futures-market" target="_self">futures open interest</a> (OI) has decreased to around $2.53 billion on Tuesday, down 55% from peaks of $4.55 billion recorded in early January, <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/XRP" target="_blank">data from CoinGlass shows</a>.</p><p>This suggests that leverage traders are reducing their exposure rather than opening new positions, signaling weakening bearish conviction and possible price reversal if buying pressure returns.&nbsp;</p><h2>XRP spot taker CVD signals high buyer volumes</h2><p>Analyzing the 90-day spot taker cumulative volume delta (CVD) reveals that buy orders (taker buy) have become dominant again. CVD measures the difference between buy and sell volume over a three-month period.</p><p>Until late yesterday, the CVD remained neutral, reflecting indecision in the market.</p><p>This metric flipped positive on Tuesday (green bar in the chart below), indicating a rebound in demand, with buyers regaining control.</p><p>If the CVD remains green, it would mean buyers are buying more at lower levels, which could set the stage for another leg upward, as seen in historical recoveries.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6cb0-8002-74b8-b68e-958d032ff066.png"><figcaption><em>XRP spot taker CVD. Source: CryptoQuant</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Spot XRP ETFs inflows continue despite crash</h2><p>US-based spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continued to attract investor interest, with these investment products recording inflows 53 days out of 59, underscoring persistent institutional demand since their <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/canary-capital-spot-xrp-etf-set-for-launch-this-week" target="_self">launch in November 2025</a>.</p><p>Spot XRP ETFs added $4.5 million on Friday, bringing cumulative inflows to $1.23 billion and total net assets under management to over $1.01 billion, according to SoSoValue data.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6cb0-87dd-761d-92ac-09b12b634507.png"><figcaption><em>Spot XRP ETF flows data. Source: SoSoValue</em></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, while global crypto investment products logged the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-etf-4-week-outflows-173-million-btc-below-70k">fourth week of outflows totaling $173 million</a>, XRP ETPs bucked the trend, emerging as the top performer with inflows of $33.4 million during the week ending Feb.13.&nbsp;</p><p>This reinforced the steady institutional demand for XRP-based ETPs, even as the market price weakened. </p></div><p><span>This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

<p>iOS 26.3 is the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/11/apple-releases-ios-26-3-for-iphone-heres-whats-new/">latest iPhone software update</a>, and one of its most interesting new features is a privacy setting—‘Limit Precise Location’—that reveals Apple at its best.</p>



<h2>‘Limit Precise Location’ is a new privacy setting in iOS 26.3</h2>

<p>iOS 26.3 launched this week with a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/12/ios-26-3-new-features-for-iphone/">handful of features and changes</a>—most of which were fairly minor. Bug fixes and security improvements were a bigger focus with this update.</p>



<p>However, the most fascinating addition in my mind is a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/26/ios-26-3-adds-new-feature-to-limit-location-data-shared-with-your-carrier/">new privacy feature</a>.</p>



<p>‘Limit Precise Location’ is one of iOS 26.3’s key additions. And though it’s only available on a few devices now, it will expand significantly later this year.</p>



<p>The feature is an optional setting found in Settings ⇾ Cellular ⇾ Cellular Data Options.</p>



<p>Here’s what it does, per Apple’s support document:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Cellular networks can determine your location based on which cell towers your device connects to. The limit precise location setting enhances your location privacy by reducing the precision of location data available to cellular networks.</p>



<p>With this setting turned on, some information made available to cellular networks is limited. As a result, they might be able to determine only a less precise location — for example, the neighborhood where your device is located, rather than a more precise location (such as a street address). The setting doesn’t impact signal quality or user experience.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To use ‘Limit Precise Location,’ your device needs an Apple-designed modem like C1 or C1X, so currently only iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and the M5 iPad Pro are compatible. Carrier support is <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/126101#ntf">currently limited</a> as well.</p>



<p>But the iPhone 18 line <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/26/iphone-18-pro-six-new-features-are-coming-later-this-year/">will add support with its C2 chip</a>, and more carriers should get on board later too.</p>



<h2>Why this new feature shows the best of Apple</h2>



<figure><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/09/apple-security-liquid-glass.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Despite the current limited support, ‘Limit Precise Location’ shows the best of Apple for two main reasons:</p>



<ol>
<li>User privacy is at the core</li>



<li>It’s enabled by Apple controlling the tech stack</li>
</ol>



<p>Apple has a strong reputation for protecting user privacy. </p>



<p>From the way Face ID and Touch ID are designed, to prioritizing on-device and Private Cloud Compute for AI tasks, and a lot more, Apple has a long track record of keeping privacy core to its products.</p>



<p>’Limit Precise Location’ isn’t a feature I was asking for. Not because I don’t want it, but because I wouldn’t have ever thought it possible. </p>



<p>I value my privacy, but carriers’ ability to track me has long felt like a lost cause. I don’t love it, but I also feel powerless to do anything about it.</p>



<p>But with this iOS 26.3 innovation, Apple has made it possible to take back a little privacy I long ago forfeited.</p>



<p>And this was achieved thanks to Apple controlling the technology stack in the iPhone.</p>



<p>Apple silicon has been one of the company’s most undisputed wins of recent years. And the advent of Apple-designed 5G modems and wireless chips is the latest proof of that.</p>



<p>Rumors indicate Apple worked hard for many years before shipping its C1 modem last year. It could have saved all that effort and kept paying Qualcomm for modems. But then we would never have features like ‘Limit Precise Location,’ or <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/12/iphone-18-pros-new-c2-chip-will-bring-three-advantages-over-iphone-17/">the other advantages</a> Apple’s modems offer.</p>



<h2>iOS 26.3’s ‘Limit Precise Location’ feature: wrap-up</h2>



<p>The impact of this new feature may be small at the moment, but that will change in time. And I love that Apple is willing to invest in a privacy innovation like this, even knowing adoption will be slow. </p>



<p>It makes the iPhone better, and serves Apple’s customers better, despite not being flashy or buzz-worthy.</p>

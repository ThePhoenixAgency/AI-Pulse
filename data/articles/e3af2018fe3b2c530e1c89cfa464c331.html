<p>Apple plans a major change for the iPhone 18 series in Europe, and it directly affects how you use your mobile number. The company is preparing to remove the physical SIM card slot and rely entirely on eSIM, which means you will activate your carrier digitally instead of inserting a card. Apple already did this in the United States, and now Europe appears next in line.</p>



<p>With the removal of the SIM tray, Apple gains extra internal space, and that space goes toward battery size rather than new hardware features. Reports say the iPhone 18 Pro Max battery will <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/iphone-18-pro-max-battery-leak-reveals-capacity-differences-by-region/">reach between 5,100 and 5,200mAh</a>, which brings about 5 percent longer battery life compared to current models. Apple still refuses to use silicon-carbon batteries, so the company focuses on small structural changes to extend endurance instead.</p>



<p>In a new <a target="_blank" href="https://techmaniacs.gr/apokleistiko-iphone-18-choris-sim-ola-ta-epomena-tilefona-tis-apple-kai-stin-eyropi/">report</a> (in Greek), <em>Techmaniacs </em>claims Apple will expand eSIM-only support to Europe with the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max launch this fall, explaining the recent rumors about larger batteries.</p>



<h2>What changes for users</h2>



<p>You will no longer insert a SIM card into the phone, and instead the device will support two eSIM profiles for people who keep a second number. However, this change creates inconvenience for users who switch SIM cards often, especially in countries where carriers charge for issuing a new eSIM.</p>



<p>Apple currently sells eSIM-only iPhones in multiple regions including the United States, Japan, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia, so Europe joining the list follows an already established rollout strategy.</p>



<h2>Release timing</h2>



<p>We already anticipate that Apple is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-reportedly-wont-launch-the-base-iphone-18-in-2026/">reportedly planning two launch windows</a> for the lineup.</p>



<ul>
<li>iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max in the usual September timeframe</li>



<li>Standard iPhone 18 models later, possibly early 2027</li>
</ul>



<p>This shift shows Apple prioritizes internal space efficiency and battery life over maintaining legacy hardware features, and Europe appears ready to follow the same transition already seen in the US market.</p>

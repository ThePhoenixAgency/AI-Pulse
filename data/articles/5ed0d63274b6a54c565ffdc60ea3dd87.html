Many have been lauded for their realism.</p></div><div><p>On Friday, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance accusing it of supplying Seedance with a "pirated library" of the studio's copyrighted characters, including those from Marvel and Star Wars.</p></div><div><p>Disney's lawyers accused ByteDance of committing a "virtual smash-and-grab" of their intellectual property, including superheroes from Marvel, Star Wars and various cartoons.</p></div><div><p>On Monday ByteDance told the BBC that the company "respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0."</p></div><div><p>"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users."</p></div><div><p>ByteDance did not respond to questions asking for details on the safeguards it plans to implement.</p></div><div><p>Like other generative-AI tools, Seedance can create videos based on short text prompts.</p></div><div><p>Many of Seedance's clips are based on real actors and shows and some have gone viral since the launch of its latest 2.0 version on 12 February. </p></div><div><p>The BBC has found clips online said to have been generated by Seedance showing Star Wars characters Anakin Skywalker and Rey battling with their lightsabres, and Spider-Man fighting Captain America on the streets of New York.</p></div><div><p>The company has not disclosed what data it uses to train Seedance.</p></div><div><p>ByteDance had previously said the product had already paused the ability for users to upload images of real people. </p></div><div><p>The company also said it respects intellectual property rights and copyright protections, and takes any potential infringement seriously.</p></div><div><p>Disney last year <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ydp1gdqwqo">struck a $1bn (£730m) deal</a> with the maker of ChatGPT and video-generation tool Sora, OpenAI, giving the platforms access to 200 characters from its franchises including Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars.</p></div><div><p>Disney's legal threat follows criticism from other organisations in Hollywood over the Seedance platform. Paramount Skydance has reportedly also sent Bytedance a cease-and-desist letter demanding Seedance stops using its content. Paramount Skydance has been approached for comment. </p></div><div><p>The Motion Picture Association, which represents major US studios like Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount and Netflix, has demanded that the tool "immediately cease its infringing activity".</p></div><div><p>Actors' union Sag-Aftra has also accused Seedance of "blatant infringement".</p></div><div><p>Meanwhile the Japanese government has launched an investigation into the Chinese firm over potential copyright violations, after AI-generated videos of popular Japanese anime characters showed up on online.</p></div><div><p>Other AI image‑generation tools have likewise been hit with legal action.</p></div><div><p>Last year, Disney and NBCUniversal <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5vjqdm1ypo">sued AI image generator Midjourney</a>, accusing the platform of generating "endless unauthorised copies" of the studios' copyrighted works. The case is ongoing.</p></div><div><p>Disney has also asked Google to restrict the generation of its characters on Google's AI platforms.</p></div></article></div></div>

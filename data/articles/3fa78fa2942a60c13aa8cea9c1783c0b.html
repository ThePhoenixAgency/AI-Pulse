    <pre><code>Originally published on DropThe.org. Some studios ship hits. Some studios ship consistently. Those are different things. Capcom has released 208 rated games. Their average score is 73.5. But their standard deviation is 11.4 — meaning the gap between their best and worst is enormous. They made Resident Evil 4. They also made dozens of titles you’ve already forgotten. Insomniac Games has released 21 rated games. Their average is 76.6 — three points higher. Their standard deviation is 6.9 — the tightest in the industry among studios with 20 or more titles. Their worst game scores 59.5. No stinkers. No disasters. Every release lands somewhere between good and great. We analyzed the rating histories of every game studio in our database — 50,000 games, thousands of developers, decades of data. The question wasn’t who made the best single game. It was who never misses. The Consistency Ranking To qualify, a studio needed at least 20 rated games in our database. That filters out one-hit wonders and tiny indies. What’s left are the studios with long enough track records to measure. We ranked by average IGDB rating, then flagged consistency using standard deviation. A low standard deviation means a studio’s quality doesn’t swing wildly between releases. Top Studios by Average Rating (20+ Games) Naughty Dog 83.6
BioWare 81.8
Sports Interactive 81.4
Nihon Falcom 80.9
Atlus 78.3
Blizzard 78.0
Intelligent Systems 78.0
FromSoftware 77.0
Valve 76.7
Insomniac 76.6
Nintendo EAD 76.4
Capcom 73.5 Studios with 20+ rated games | Source: DropThe analysis of 50,081 games | dropthe.org Naughty Dog: The Career With No Bad Album Naughty Dog leads the list at 83.6 across 18 rated games. Their lowest-scored title is Rings of Power from 1991 at 69.9. Every single game since Crash Bandicoot in 1996 has scored above 75. Every one. That’s 27 years without a miss. The trajectory tells the story. Crash Bandicoot era (1996-1999): average 83.6. Jak and Daxter era (2001-2005): 78.0. Uncharted era (2007-2017): 83.1. Last of Us era (2013-2022): 92.3. They didn’t just maintain quality — they climbed. Each franchise was better than the last. The Last of Us Remastered sits at 93.4. Elden Ring, FromSoftware‘s magnum opus, matches it at 94.0. But FromSoftware’s catalog includes titles in the low 50s. Naughty Dog’s floor is 70. This is an excerpt.

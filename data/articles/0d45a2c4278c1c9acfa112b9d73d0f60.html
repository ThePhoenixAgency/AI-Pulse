  <h1>'Our work for Milano-Cortina is helping create a new generation of network': HPE tells us what it takes to be…</h1>
  <p>"Traditional networks were not designed for this kind of games," notes Stefano Andreucci, senior Sales director, South Europe, networking HPE, "they were not designed to do AI, native automation, end-to-end security and real-time adaptability, so we are delivering a network that is AI-native, that is secure, and that is easy to operate."</p><p>The sheer amount of hardware being used reads like a shopping list for any cloud or infrastructure technology enthusiast - in order to support the 2026 Winter Olympics, HPE deployed more than 4,900 access points, 1500 EX Ethernet switches, 70+ MX universal routers, 50+ SRX next gen firewalls, and 30+ smart session routers.</p><p>All of this is managed and monitored by HPE Mist, the company's cloud-based, AI-native system and platform for managing all the networks, allowing them to react and adapt in real-time to dynamic, high-pressure environments such as a crowd leaving an event venue.</p><p>The company also employed Marvis, its AI assistant designed to help with network issues, spotting problems before they get too elevated, saving time needed for analysis, whilst also training and upskilling staff much more quickly.</p><figure><div><p>

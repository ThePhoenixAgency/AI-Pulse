This Valentine's Day there is a lot of red on the screen for the X.Org Server with the code delta as a result of renaming of their main Git development branch and in the process selectively dropping questionable patches to the prior "master" codebase.
</p><p>
The effort noted in January of <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/X.Org-Server-Main-Repo">X.Org Server May Create A New Selective Git Branch With Hopes Of A New Release This Year</a> has now been realized. As of a short time ago today, the "master" Git branch is ended with new X.Org Server development now on "main" and in the process starting off from a starting point of 2024 and then laying on the acceptable patches that were queued up over the past two years. See that aforelinked article for more details.
</p><p>
<a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?__goaway_challenge=meta-refresh&amp;__goaway_id=c8d9fbd9caa9a8c8751a24fb42d02f17&amp;id=0da4d2480066fb2c783325e7594902aacc23413e">This patch</a> has marked X.Org Server's "master" branch as now closed and superseded by the main branch.

<p>The X.Org Server main Git branch can be viewed <a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/log/?h=main">here</a> for those interested. That branch is now in a cleaned-up state without many of the patches accumulated that were deemed questionable and then later reverted.</p></div></div>

    <div><div> <p>The generative AI expansion continues, with the Unity game engine being turned into a slop-making machine with an upcoming update. As announced during the Q4 2025 <a href="https://investors.unity.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx" target="_blank">earnings call</a> that happened on February 11th, with the public replay recently going live recently that I've had a listen to.</p>
<p>Coming from Matthew Bromberg, CEO of Unity, here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're excited to drive this expansion of the Unity platform in 2026. AI-driven authoring, that's our second major area of focus for 2026. At the Game Developer Conference in March, we'll be unveiling a beta of the new upgraded Unity AI, which will enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform, so it's simple to move from prototype to finished product. This assistant will be powered by our unique understanding of the project context and our runtime, while leveraging the best frontier models that exist. We believe together, this combination will provide more efficient, more effective results to game developers than general-purpose models alone. AI inside Unity will lower the barrier to entry, raise productivity for existing users, and democratize game development for non-coders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's no big surprise to see Unity pushing for it, as generative AI is everywhere. From the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gdc-2026-report-36pct-of-devs-use-genai-28pct-target-steam-deck-and-8pct-target-linux/" target="_blank">recent GDC survey</a>, they saw 36% of participants note they're already using some form of it.</p>
<p>Continuing on Bromberg also noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When combined with our new web-accessible authoring environment, our goal is to remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between that first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience. And to better enable these new creators to build their businesses, Unity's toolset will include our newly enhanced in-app purchase commerce offerings. These also move into early access next week, with general availability in Q2. By integrating monetization and commerce directly into the AI authoring flow, we won't just make it easier to make games, we'll make it easier to succeed at them. When you look at all these pieces together, the compounding intelligence and performance of Vector, the accessibility of Unity in the browser, and the massive potential tailwind presented by AI authoring, the picture becomes clear.</p>
<p>We're moving from a world where game development was the province of the few, to one where it will be accessible to the many. This is what we've always called the democratization of game development, and it is in our DNA. Unity is the common denominator in this transition. We'll provide the platform to create interactive content, the engine that renders it, the runtime that connects it to players, and the advertising stack that helps consumers discover it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With all the recent news about how AI generation is causing shortages and price hikes, it makes for some perhaps difficult reading to see even more software adding to all this AI nonsense. I'm all for making game development easier and accessible - but at what cost. If you're just prompting things, you're not learning anything or improving your own understanding. You're just telling a machine to make something resembling what you asked for, and this is often based on the models being trained from the works of people who never agreed to have their data sucked up into the AI machine. All so shareholders and CEOs can continue to make their profit lines go up.</p>

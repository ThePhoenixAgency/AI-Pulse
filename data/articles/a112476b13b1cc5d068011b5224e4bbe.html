</p><p>As everyone waits <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/08/20/ben-stiller-will-not-be-directing-any-severance-season-3-episodes">for season 3</a> of <em>Severance</em>, there's news that may just ensure the series has a long future on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-tv">Apple TV</a>. It started as a series leased from Fifth Season, but now it will join Apple Studios as an in-house production.
</p><p>The news <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/apple-acquires-severance-more-seasons-1236695148/">comes from</a> <em>Deadline</em>, which says the series sold to Apple for around $70 million. The original studio is sticking around as executive producers.
</p><p>Apple TV licenses content like <em>Ted Lasso</em>, but half of its series are in-house productions for Apple Studios. Fifth Season is responsible for <em>Your Friends and Neighbors</em>, <em>Stick</em>, <em>Sugar</em>, and <em>Palm Royale</em>.
</p><p>While this deal shouldn't cause any significant changes to the series, it does mean that Apple plans a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/01/22/how-a-severance-pop-up-surprised-rush-hour-new-yorkers">more significant investment</a> in the series as a whole. We've seen a State Farm ad and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/tim-cook">Tim Cook</a> appearing <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/01/24/tim-cook-quits-apple-for-lumon-industries-in-severance-promo">in a trailer</a> for the Season 2 announcement date, so more of that is possible at a minimum.
</p><p>While not green lit, season 4 is expected, but whether or not season 5 will exist will be determined by Ben Stiller. However, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/05/29/apples-severance-could-be-the-start-of-something-bigger">spinoffs are possible</a> as a way to promote the series and keep up interest between seasons.
</p><p>The deal is beneficial to Apple and the former studio, as financial concerns could have forced production to move <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/04/07/apple-tv-brings-lumon-industries-to-life-for-thousands-of-severance-fans">from New York</a> to Canada. Each episode of season 2 was estimated to cost around $20 million each, but Apple can easily foot the bill.
</p><p>The time between seasons <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/16/apple-wants-to-avoid-another-three-year-wait-for-more-severance">may continue</a> to be quite long, as the writers prefer making corrections during the scriptwriting process and not during production. So, every script has to be finished before filming.
</p><p>Season 3 is expected to begin filming sometime in the summer of 2026, so it may still be some time before a release. In the meantime, we might see the return of Tim C as the new owner of the fan-favorite series.</p> </div> </article> </main> </div></div>

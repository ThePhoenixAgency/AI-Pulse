</h2> <div>Pixelmator Pro, the award-winning image editor for Mac, comes with the all-new Apple Creator Studio, bringing an approachable and professional editing experience to even more creators. Pixelmator Pro is packed with powerful image editing tools, empowering Apple Creator Studio subscribers and one-time-purchase Mac users to design, draw, paint, and refine their creative vision, and so much more. For the first time, Pixelmator Pro is coming to iPad, bringing an all-new touch-optimized workspace, full Apple Pencil support, the ability to work between iPad and Mac, and all of the powerful editing tools users have come to appreciate on Mac. Pixelmator Pro for iPad offers fast and efficient image editing, leveraging the blazing performance of Apple silicon and built from scratch for the latest iPadOS.

The full-featured Layers sidebar allows creators to build designs using a range of unique elements like images, shapes, text, and even video. Smart selection tools help users isolate and edit specific parts of images effortlessly, and with advanced bitmap and vector masks, users can hide or reveal discrete portions of their designs. The deep integration of hardware, software, and Apple silicon unlocks features like Super Resolution for intelligently upscaling photos, Deband for removing compression artifacts, and automatic composition suggestions with Auto Crop. With full support for Apple Pencil, digital artists can enjoy painting in the most natural way with a beautiful collection of pressure-sensitive brushes. And unmatched Apple Pencil precision — combined with features like hover,<sup>9</sup> squeeze,<sup>10</sup> and double-tap<sup>11</sup> — gives creators the ability to craft pixel-perfect designs.

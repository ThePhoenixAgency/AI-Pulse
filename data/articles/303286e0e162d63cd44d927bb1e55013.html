<p>AI companies have been hemorrhaging talent the past few weeks. Half of xAI’s founding team has left the company — some on their own, others through “restructuring” — while OpenAI is facing its own shakeups, from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/openai-disbands-mission-alignment-team-which-focused-on-safe-and-trustworthy-ai-development/" target="_blank">disbanding of its mission alignment team</a> to the firing of a policy exec who opposed its “adult mode” feature. </p>



<p>On this episode of TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/" target="_blank">Equity</a> podcast, hosts Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and Sean O’Kane dig into the week’s biggest deals and departures, from billion-dollar bets on fusion and robotics to the tech exodus reshaping AI companies. </p>

</ul>

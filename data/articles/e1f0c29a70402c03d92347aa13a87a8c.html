This means that if you don’t have an allergy, you’ll likely know someone who does — and it’s not a pleasant situation to be in. This condition affects not only patients’ physical health but also takes a significant toll on their mental well-being and overall quality of life.</p>
<p><em>So, what can we do about it?</em></p>
<p>In recent years, biomedical research has made several remarkable advances: from experimental vaccines and desensitization-based immunotherapies to improved diagnostic tools capable of identifying specific allergen sensitivities with unprecedented precision. These developments are pointing us in the right direction toward building long-term immune tolerance, but we’re not quite there yet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we’ve also witnessed groundbreaking progress in artificial intelligence applied to biology and medicine. Models like <strong>AlphaFold</strong> and <strong>Boltz-1</strong> have revolutionized protein structure prediction, while AI-driven approaches in <strong>genomics</strong>, <strong>drug discovery</strong>, and <strong>molecular modeling</strong> are accelerating the pace of biomedical innovation. The convergence of these worlds is opening up new possibilities for understanding, predicting, and ultimately treating complex immune conditions such as food allergies. </p>

<em>Four among the major allergenic proteins folded by AlphaFold. Up left to bottom right: glycinin (soybean), ovalbumin (egg), alpha lactalbumin (milk), ara-h-2 (peanut).</em> </p>
<p>Our vision with the <strong>AI for Food Allergies</strong> project is to build the first <strong>community-driven research lab</strong> dedicated to exploring how artificial intelligence can meaningfully advance the field of food allergy research. We aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and biomedical science by developing open, collaborative projects that contribute tangible value to researchers, clinicians, and patients alike.</p>
<h2> <a href="#current-state-of-the-art-where-ai-meets-food-allergy-research"> <span></span> </a> <span> Current State of The Art: <strong>Where AI Meets Food Allergy Research</strong> </span>
</h2>
<p>The last couple of years have been transformative for food allergy research. Artificial intelligence, once limited to image recognition or text translation, now operates comfortably in the biological and regulatory spaces that define food safety.</p>
<p>This evolution began with early bioinformatics techniques utilized sequence alignment and physicochemical descriptors to detect and flag potential allergens. Databases such as <strong>SDAP</strong> and <strong>AllergenOnline</strong> were used to identify cross-reactive proteins. Machine-learning algorithms such as <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2689655">AllerHunter</a>, and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.22.509069v2.full">NetAllergen</a> later enhanced these methods, training on thousands of known allergens and non-allergens to improve predictive accuracy. </p>
<p>Today, at the <strong>molecular level</strong>, deep learning models like <strong>ProtBERT</strong>, <strong>ESM-2</strong>, and <strong>AllergenBERT</strong> can analyze amino-acid sequences to predict whether a protein might act as an allergen. They identify subtle biochemical patterns, sequence motifs, secondary-structure signals, and epitope similarities, which correlate with immune reactions. For example, <strong>AllergenAI</strong> applies convolutional neural networks to allergen sequences from <strong>SDAP 2.0</strong>, <strong>COMPARE</strong>, and <strong>AlgPred 2</strong>, uncovering motifs essential for IgE binding and demonstrating the promise of integrating structural data into prediction pipelines What used to require months of lab experiments can now be screened computationally, dramatically accelerating allergen discovery in novel foods and plant-based proteins.</p>
<p>Concurrently, AI is expanding the scope of allergy therapeutics through advances in <strong>drug-target interaction (DTI)</strong> modelling. Deep neural networks, graph neural networks and transformer models utilize data from chemogenomic datasets such as <strong>DAVIS</strong>, <strong>PDBbind</strong> to predict binding affinities, enabling virtual screening of compounds that can potentially inhibit IgE–FcεRI binding or modulate inflammatory pathways. Multimodal datasets that contain molecular structures, transcriptomics and imaging readouts can be utilized for tasks such as small molecule generation, prediction of properties and assessment of immune cell response. The subsequent subheadings present critical datasets supporting the mentioned AI approaches and explain how each resource is employed in food allergy drug design.</p>
<p>In <strong>clinical research</strong>, AI is helping refine diagnostics. Traditionally, allergists rely on a mix of skin-prick results, serum-specific IgE levels, and patient history, but interpreting these together is difficult. Machine learning models have begun combining these modalities to estimate the <em>true</em> probability of a food allergy, reducing unnecessary oral food challenges and improving patient safety. Importantly, these models don’t replace doctors, they simply reduce uncertainty and provide interpretable probabilities rather than binary outcomes.</p>
<p>On the <strong>consumer and regulatory side</strong>, advances in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have made it possible to read and understand ingredient labels at scale. NLP models trained on multilingual data can detect hidden or misspelled allergen names (“tahini” → sesame, “paneer” → dairy), while vision models can read curved, low-light packaging and extract ingredient text more reliably than standard OCR systems. Combined with live monitoring of FDA and USDA recall feeds, AI can now alert consumers to undeclared allergen risks in near real time.</p>

<h2> <a href="#the-need-for-data"> <span></span> </a> <span> The need for data </span>
</h2>
<p>A fundamental step in applying Machine Learning to this field is <strong>having access to high-quality data</strong>. As highlighted by Channing and Ghosh in their position paper <em>“<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06580">AI for Scientific Discovery is a Social Problem</a>”</em>, the real challenge in ML for science goes beyond advanced models and powerful GPUs. It lies in the <strong>scarcity, fragmentation, and inaccessibility of data</strong>. This issue is particularly evident in the biomedical domain, where <strong>data gatekeeping, inconsistent standards, and lack of interoperability</strong> often hinder collaboration and slows down progress.</p>
<h2> <a href="#collection-release"> <span></span> </a> <span> Collection release </span>
</h2>
<p>The first milestone of our community is dedicated to addressing this very challenge. We have curated <em>Awesome Food Allergy Datasets</em>, the <strong>first open collection of datasets on food allergies</strong>, meticulously annotated and categorized to serve as a foundation for future research. By making this resource openly accessible, we aim to accelerate discovery, foster collaboration, and lower the entry barrier for researchers and innovators interested in applying AI to this critical field.</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/62f75c07870a3f98bbf46ebc/19U2JVbhPbq2bbvP7ECGE.png"><img alt="dataset_stats" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/62f75c07870a3f98bbf46ebc/19U2JVbhPbq2bbvP7ECGE.png"></a>
<em>Stats about the distribution of our datasets by data type, category and public availability.</em></p>
<p>We organize this resource into <strong>three complementary layers</strong>, each designed to serve a specific part of the AI-for-Food-Allergies ecosystem.</p>
<h3> <a href="#-the-protein-and-molecular-allergenicity-layer"> <span></span> </a> <span> <strong>&nbsp;The Protein and Molecular Allergenicity Layer</strong> </span>
</h3>
<p>At the molecular level, we are assembling what may become the most complete open dataset for allergen and protein analysis ever built. It merges classical allergen repositories with next-generation molecular and drug-target databases, enabling deep learning models to move seamlessly from sequence to structure to immune response.</p>
<p>This layer draws from trusted allergen-focused sources such as <strong>WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Database</strong>, <strong>AllergenOnline</strong>, <strong>Allergen30</strong>,<strong>AllerBase</strong>, <strong>AllFam</strong>, <strong>Allermatch</strong>, <strong>AllerHunter</strong>, <strong>AllerCatPro 2.0</strong>, <strong>AllergenAI</strong>,<strong>NetAllergen</strong>, <strong>AllerTOP v1.1</strong>, <strong>Alleropedia</strong>, <strong>Allergome</strong>, and the <strong>Allergen Family Database</strong>. These provide verified allergenic and non-allergenic protein sequences, family classifications, and cross-reactivity annotations.</p>
<p>To capture the biochemical and structural side of allergenicity, we integrate resources like <strong>SDAP 2.0</strong>, <strong>PDBBind+</strong>, <strong>ProPepper</strong>, and quantum-chemistry datasets including <strong>nabla²DFT</strong>, <strong>QM</strong>, <strong>QDπ</strong>, <strong>QCML</strong>, and <strong>QCDGE</strong>. These datasets provide molecular surfaces, binding affinities, and electrostatic descriptors that help AI models learn <em>why</em> certain proteins interact with IgE antibodies.</p>
<p>Because allergic response often overlaps with pharmacology, this layer also incorporates <strong>drug–target and compound databases</strong> such as <strong>DAVIS</strong>, <strong>QSAR</strong>, <strong>e-Drug3D</strong>, <strong>Stanford Drug Data</strong>, <strong>DrugCentral</strong>, <strong>MedKG</strong>, <strong>Therapeutic Target Database</strong>, <strong>STITCH</strong>, <strong>Probes &amp; Drugs</strong>, <strong>IUPHAR Pharmacology</strong>, and <strong>Enamine REAL</strong>. These enable studies of cross-reactivity between allergens and drugs, side-effects that mimic allergic reactions, and opportunities for immunomodulatory therapy.</p>
<p>Each record in this unified dataset is annotated with sequence data, taxonomy, molecular descriptors, and literature references. We apply <strong>homology reduction</strong> to prevent data leakage between training and test sets and evaluate model quality using <strong>AUROC</strong>, <strong>AUPRC</strong>, <strong>MCC</strong>, and <strong>calibration scores</strong>. This layer serves as the foundation for building transformer-based models that predict allergenicity, drug–allergen interactions, and cross-reactive epitopes.</p>
<hr>
<h3> <a href="#-the-clinical-immunological-and-therapeutic-layer"> <span></span> </a> <span> <strong> The Clinical, Immunological, and Therapeutic Layer</strong> </span>
</h3>
<p>Allergies begin at the immune level, and understanding that requires human data. The second layer combines immunology, clinical, and trial datasets to help researchers model how allergic sensitization, tolerance, and treatment evolve over time.</p>
<p>From the immunological perspective, we include the <strong>IEDB (Immune Epitope Database)</strong> and its <strong>Analysis Resource</strong>, alongside specialized datasets like <strong>AlgPred 2.0</strong>, <strong>Allergen30</strong>, <strong>Allergen Peptide Browser</strong>, and <strong>ProPepper</strong>, which map B- and T-cell epitopes and antibody binding regions.</p>
<p>For studying patient-level outcomes, we integrate clinical and population datasets such as <strong>Food Anaphylaxis ML Dataset (TIP)</strong>, <strong>Food Allergy Risk Stratification Dataset</strong>, <strong>Food Allergy &amp; Intolerance Dataset</strong>, and <strong>AllergyMap</strong>. Large-scale cohorts like <strong>HealthNuts</strong>, <strong>CHILD</strong>, and <strong>DIABIMMUNE</strong>, plus microbiome-focused datasets (e.g., <em>Dysfunctional Gut Microbiome Networks in Childhood IgE-Mediated Food Allergy</em> and <em>Akkermansia muciniphila in Fibre-Deprived Mice</em>), enrich this layer with genetic and microbial context.</p>
<p>Simulated datasets — such as the <strong>Simulated Allergen Immunotherapy Trials Dataset</strong>, <strong>Simulated AIT Trials Dataset</strong>, and <strong>FARE Food Allergy Research</strong> data — allow us to model the long-term response to desensitization therapies without exposing patients to risk.</p>
<p>Genetic and biochemical variability is represented through <strong>GWAS</strong>, <strong>DNA Methylation GSE59999</strong>, and the <strong>Human Metabolome Database</strong>. These allow multi-omics studies of how genes, metabolism, and environment combine to shape allergic disease.</p>
<p>Together, these resources form the backbone for predictive models that estimate reaction risk, identify candidate biomarkers, and simulate therapy outcomes — a foundation for safer, more personalized allergy care.</p>
<hr>
<h3> <a href="#-the-food-ingredient-and-regulatory-layer"> <span></span> </a> <span> <strong> The Food, Ingredient, and Regulatory Layer</strong> </span>
</h3>
<p>The final layer connects lab science to real-world food safety. Here, we focus on datasets that describe what consumers actually eat, how products are labeled, and how authorities respond to allergen incidents.</p>
<p>We curate large multilingual ingredient and product databases such as <strong>Open Food Facts</strong>, <strong>Food Ingredients and Allergens</strong>, <strong>Ingredients with 16 Allergen Tags</strong>, <strong>Allergen Status of Food Products</strong>, and <strong>FSA Allergen Database Service</strong> (UK Nut Allergy Registry). Complementary regulatory datasets include <strong>Swiss Legislation on Food Allergens</strong>, <strong>COMPARE</strong>, and the <strong>FSA Allergen Database Service</strong>, which provide consistent allergen codes and labeling standards.</p>
<p>For real-world adverse-event tracking, we rely on <strong>CAERS (CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System)</strong>, <strong>PEAR – Partners’ Enterprise-wide Allergy Repository</strong>, and <strong>Food: Allergen and Allergy</strong>, which capture anonymized clinical reports and recall histories. Government recall sources from <strong>FDA</strong>, <strong>USDA</strong>, and <strong>CFIA</strong>, as well as global registries, are continuously ingested to monitor undeclared-allergen events and labeling failures.</p>
<p>These datasets feed into our <strong>Multilingual Ingredient and Label Corpus</strong>, where text data are normalized through an ontology that maps local terms (“tahini,” “gingelly,” “sesame paste”) to canonical allergens. Synthetic label images are generated to mimic supermarket conditions — glare, blur, curved surfaces, and multi-language fonts — allowing models to learn in realistic settings.</p>
<p>By combining structured recall data with visual and linguistic information, this layer empowers AI systems that can <em>read</em> packaging, <em>understand</em> its content, and <em>flag</em> inconsistencies in real time.</p>

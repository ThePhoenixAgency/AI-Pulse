    <div><div>   <p>When it comes to <strong>Walmart </strong><span>(NASDAQ: WMT)</span> stock, most analysts rate it a buy or a strong buy.</p>   <p>The world's largest retailer has worked to win over more high-income shoppers and has applied artificial intelligence (AI) to improve logistics and foster a growing digital ad platform. Moreover, a move to the <strong>Nasdaq </strong>seems to have attracted more investors.</p>      <p><em><strong>Will AI create the world's first trillionaire?</strong>&nbsp;Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an "Indispensable Monopoly" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need.&nbsp;</em></p>   <p>Nonetheless, when investors take a deeper look into the financial metrics, it calls into question whether Walmart is truly prospering in the current environment. Thus, despite those successes, now is probably not a good time to add shares of , and here's why.</p>   <figure><div> <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AvJefeObuqzZ.mlACTCrTg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/5cf751bc8c1a0238afa4e89aed06e6be" alt="A Walmart storefront on a winter&amp;#39;s day."></p></div> <figcaption>Image source: Getty Images.  </figcaption> </figure>      <p>Walmart has stood out by reviving its business in recent years. After years of struggle, it has leaned into technology to boost its e-commerce presence and improve its supply chain.</p>   <p>Additionally, after stumbling internationally in past years, it has adapted product offerings to meet local needs and focused on e-commerce in markets like Mexico, China, and India to improve sales abroad.</p>   <p>Amid the e-commerce focus and use of AI, some analysts are now . With that, its stock is up by nearly 170% over the last five years, well ahead of the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>.</p>      <p>Unfortunately, for all of these improvements, Walmart remains a slow-growth enterprise. In the first nine months of 2025, the company reported almost $573 billion in revenue, a growth rate of 4%. However, the numbers look less encouraging when looking at them closely.</p>   <p>Its net income for the same period of just under $18 billion was up by nearly 25% from year-ago levels. Unfortunately, "other gains and losses" accounted for most of that gain, and that primarily came from rising values in its equity investments. When factoring in the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, operating income actually <em>fell</em> by 2% over the same period.</p>   <p>Moreover, despite that performance, Walmart arguably trades at a premium valuation. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio now stands at 45. That is well above the S&amp;P 500's average earnings multiple of 30.</p>    <p>Still, the more surprising part of that is that it makes Walmart stock more expensive than <strong>Amazon</strong>, which now sells at 30 times earnings. Given Walmart's growth challenges, one has to wonder whether the stock is worth that premium.</p>  </div></div>

  <h1>BBC presenting duties to be shared for World Cup – but who will host the final?</h1>

  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>When the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc">BBC</a> split the task of presenting Match of the Day between three prominent broadcasters, executives were clear – there were to be “no favourites” among the new hosts Kelly Cates, Gabby Logan and Mark Chapman.</p><p>That mantra is now being underlined as the corporation prepares its coverage for this summer’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football">World Cup</a>. It is understood producers are ensuring that the trio have an equal number of programmes to present once the tournament kicks off in Mexico City.</p><p>There is, however, one big unresolved question as the epic task of planning the coverage takes shape – no decision has yet been taken on who will host the final.</p><p>Cates, Logan and Chapman took over Match of the Day presenting duties at the start of the current Premier League season, replacing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/gary-lineker">Gary Lineker</a> after his 26-year association with the programme.</p><p>Lineker had initially agreed a deal to present the World Cup for the BBC, which takes place across Canada, Mexico and the US. However, he ended his BBC presenting career early last year, after he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/19/gary-lineker-to-leave-bbc">apologised for amplifying online material</a> with antisemitic connotations.</p><p>It means the three hosts will share the presenter’s chair, with producers working hard to ensure they receive a fair share of the top games. Even insiders are in the dark about who will be given the task of fronting the World Cup final coverage.</p><p>The three will be part of an increasingly crowded field of World Cup content, which will include Lineker himself. His The Rest Is Football video podcast, part of the Goalhanger stable of podcasts that he co-founded, has struck a deal with Netflix to present a daily edition from New York.</p><p>Chapman, Cates and Logan also have podcast commitments during the tournament, while BBC pundits Micah Richards and Alan Shearer will appear on Lineker’s podcast. The BBC has made clear it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2026/jan/29/bbc-licence-fee-money-pundits-podcast-world-cup-2026">will not use licence fee payers’ money</a> to help cover their expenses for the work they do for rival podcasts.</p><p>The BBC’s plans come as insiders are pointing to evidence that its controversial modernisation of the Match of the Day brand is beginning to bear fruit.</p><p>Insiders said a fall of about 10% in the combined linear TV and iPlayer views of Saturday and Sunday Match of the Day shows this season – about 770,000 viewers – was “more than offset” by a new rights agreement allowing viewers to access highlights at 8pm, alongside the traditional programmes.</p><p>The number of digital BBC accounts accessing Match of the Day content in an average game week is up 21% year on year. The figure includes viewing of the Saturday and Sunday programmes on iPlayer, the new 8pm highlights on iPlayer, and highlight clips on the BBC Sport website and app.</p><p>“It’s wonderful to see Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan (alphabetical order, there are no favourites!) continuing the fine work of Gary Lineker, Des Lynam, Jimmy Hill and others in the famous chair,” said Alex Kay-Jelski, the director of BBC Sport, in an online post.</p><p>“We will keep trying new things and trying to make as much of the football-loving audience as entertained and informed as we can. And we will keep learning from everyone doing great things out there, from content creators to Sky to clubs.”</p><figure></figure><figure></figure><p>Much of the BBC’s early World Cup presenting duties will take place from its Salford base, as the corporation – along with all broadcasters covering the tournament – grapples with the logistics and costs of covering an event spanning three huge countries.</p><p>The tournament has also expanded from 32 teams to a new 48-team format, leading to a significant increase in the number of games, from 64 to 104 by the time the winners lift the trophy.</p><p>With the licence fee already under considerable pressure, BBC insiders have been battling to manage the costs of covering the tournament. It is understood some TV commentators and pundits are likely to be asked to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/03/bbc-criticised-for-plan-to-cover-some-world-cup-2026-games-remotely">cover some lower-demand games from Salford</a>.</p><p>The costs associated with having commentary teams in a stadium, even without the associated accommodation and flight expenses, are understood to be significant. Major games, including all of those played by the home nations, will be covered by commentary teams at the stadiums.</p></div></div>

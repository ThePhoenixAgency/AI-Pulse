He attended a 2011 event at Epstein’s home, and his family had lunch with Epstein on his private island in 2012 – four years after Epstein was sentenced to 13 months in jail for procuring a minor for prostitution.</p><p>The Wall Street billionaire and longtime Trump ally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/10/howard-lutnick-epstein-private-island">admitted to the 2012 lunch</a> earlier this month in testimony before the Senate appropriations committee.</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markI did have lunch with him, as I was on a boat going across on a family vacation. My wife was with me, as were my four children and nannies. I had another couple with – they were there as well, with their children. And we had lunch on the island, that is true, for an hour.</p>
</blockquote><p>In that testimony, Lutnick <strong>insisted that he “barely had anything to do” with Epstein</strong>. He testified:</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markI’m glad to be here to make it clear that I met <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> when he moved, when I moved to a house next door to him in New York. Over the next 14 years, I met him two other times that I can recall, two times. So six years later, I met him, and then a year and a half after that, I met him, and never again.</p>
</blockquote><p>Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have called for Lutnick’s resignation following his initial misrepresentation of the relationship. “He should be removed from office and at a minimum should come before the committee,” the House oversight committee’s top Democrat, <strong>Robert Garcia,</strong> has said.</p><p>As we’ve reported, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> earlier defended his commerce secretary, calling him a “very innocent guy” who is “doing a great job”.</p><p>Lutnick has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.</p></article><article><header><h2>Democrats say Clinton's cooperation and transparency sets precedent for summoning presidents</h2></header><p>Democrats on the committee praised former president <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> for attending the deposition, saying he has been transparent and is answering tough questions about his ties to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p><p>Updating the media just now outside the hearing in Chappaqua, they said that the former president made more sense to question than <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>, given he had documented interactions with Epstein over the years. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/clinton">Bill Clinton</a> has been cooperative and thorough in his responses, they said.</p><p>“We are thankful that President Clinton came in and answered tough questions from both the minority party and the majority party,” ranking member <strong>Robert Garcia</strong> said. “We also think it’s important to note … that he does not understand nor do we why we spent so much time yesterday grilling Secretary Clinton.”</p><p>But, they say, now that a former president has come to the committee, it shows that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> should come in as well.</p><p>“We have a new precedent in this country,” Garcia said. <strong>“We can now demand presidents and former presidents to testify in front of the oversight committee.</strong> So we are once again demanding that now President Trump, who was in the Epstein files almost more than anyone else besides Ghislaine Maxwell, answer our questions.”</p><p>Garcia also pushed back on <strong>James Comer’s</strong> comment earlier that Bill Clinton said it was up to the committee whether to bring Trump in for questioning, saying he didn’t think Comer’s accounting was a complete and accurate summation of what Clinton said.</p></article><article><header><h2>Comer: Clinton defers to House committee when asked about summoning Trump</h2></header><p><strong>James Comer</strong>, the chair of the House oversight committee, just updated the media on a response from former president <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> regarding <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p><p>He said Democratic ranking member <strong>Robert Garcia</strong> asked Clinton whether Trump should be called to answer questions from the committee.</p><p><strong>“And President Clinton said, that’s for you to decide,”</strong> Comer said. “And the President went on to say, President Trump has never said anything to me to make me think he was involved.”</p></article><article><header><h2>Trump on Bill Clinton: 'I don’t like seeing him deposed'</h2></header><p><strong>Donald Trump weighed in on Bill Clinton</strong> appearing before the committee, according to a White House pool report.</p><p>“I don’t like seeing him deposed.

Before that, in 1955, <strong>Harry Truman</strong>, then a former president, talked to a Senate committee on foreign relations about the United Nations charter.</p><p>Ford was also the last sitting US president to appear before Congress.

He flew on Epstein’s plane several times in the early 2000s after he left office and says he severed ties in the mid-2000s, several years before Epstein’s 2008 conviction of soliciting prostitution from a minor.</p><p>A reminder that Clinton is not accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein, and appearing in the files is not in itself evidence of any wrongdoing.</p><figure><div><img alt="man smiles with woman whose face is redacted" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ded0a8c01be867316288c8d9aa6ab67ba9157cc9/474_348_2346_1876/master/2346.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Bill Clinton and a woman, whose face is redacted, in a photo released by the Department of Justice on 19 December 2025.</span> Photograph: US Justice Department/Reuters</figcaption></figure><figure><div><img alt="signature on printed photo of two women and three men smiling together" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3af093ca23e6e3980a629b9aa4a7b3610aa78bb1/151_101_2908_2327/master/2908.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Bill Clinton’s signature on a photo in which he is pictured with Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. </span> Photograph: US Department of Justice</figcaption></figure><figure><div><img alt="two men smiling together" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ab70ccff8b2e1ae8afef0b7d182bb90aba35c87/585_366_3173_2538/master/3173.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Mick Jagger and Bill Clinton pictured in an image released by the DoJ with a woman whose face is redacted.</span> Photograph: US Department of Justice</figcaption></figure><figure><div><img alt="three people smile together" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c4196b2ad86b94bdf578566cbb9fe651455e1cb/883_490_2988_2390/master/2988.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Michael Jackson, Bill Clinton, Diana Ross, and a woman whose face is redacted, in another image released by the DoJ from its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.</span> Photograph: US Department of Justice</figcaption></figure><figure><div><img alt="two men stand together smiling and looking to side" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ac64bc4661119b5f905fbf041a22407d8ac8f30/245_606_1982_1585/master/1982.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Bill Clinton with Jeffrey Epstein in an image released by the justice department.</span> Photograph: US Department of Justice</figcaption></figure></article><article><header></header><p>More from <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>’s opening remarks.</p><p>The former president said he only had a “brief acquaintance with Epstein” that ended “years before his crimes came to light” and that he never saw “what was truly going on”. Here’s the extract:</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markThe girls and women whose lives Jeffrey Epstein destroyed deserve not only justice, but healing. They’ve been waiting too long for both. Though my brief acquaintance with Epstein ended years before his crimes came to light, and though I never witnessed during our limited interactions any indication of what was truly going on, I am here to offer what little I know so that it might prevent anything like this from ever happening again.</p>
</blockquote><p>He added that he would “often” say “I don’t recall”, as his interactions with Epstein were such a long time ago, and said this might be “unsatisfying” to lawmakers.</p></article><article><header></header><p><strong>Bill Clinton</strong> also made reference to his wife <strong>Hillary</strong> <strong>Clinton</strong>’s six-hour-plus grilling from the committee yesterday, saying it was “simply not right” that she was brought in.</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markBefore we start, I have to get personal. You made Hillary come in. She had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. Nothing. She has no memory of even meeting him. She neither traveled with him nor visited any of his properties. Whether you subpoenaed 10 people or 10,000, including her was simply not right.</p>
</blockquote></article><article><header><h2>Bill Clinton says he had no idea of Epstein's crimes</h2></header><p>In his opening statement, former president <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> also said he saw no signs of <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>’s crimes.</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markAs someone who grew up in a home with domestic abuse, not only would I have not flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing – I would have turned him in myself and led the call for justice for his crimes, not sweetheart deals.</p> <p>But even with 20/20 hindsight, I saw nothing that ever gave me pause. We are only here because he hid it from everyone so well for so long. And by the time it came to light with his 2008 guilty plea, I had long stopped associating with him.</p>

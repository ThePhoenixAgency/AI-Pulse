"That's probably not the case, but that's where we are right now in that sentiment."</p>      <p>The swoons for various industries to start 2026 contrast with much of last year, when optimism over AI-driven profits and capital spending ‌helped drive a broad swath of stocks higher.</p>   <p>AI winner ⁠and loser moves in single stocks "are getting more and more extreme," Jonathan Krinsky, BTIG's chief market technician, said in a note on Thursday morning.</p>   <p>"At a certain point ... we begin getting concerned that the weakness supersedes the strength and the broad market becomes ⁠vulnerable," Krinsky said.</p>   <p>ROTATIONS PAVING WAY FOR NEW MARKET LEADERS?</p>   <p>Pressure from AI has also contributed to declines for the heavyweight technology sector, which has mostly led the gains for the bull market that began in October 2022, but was last down over 4% this year.</p>      <p>Broadening gains have helped offset tech's troubles, with investors moving into groups that have lagged. Four ​sectors ​are up at least 10% in 2026 - energy, consumer staples, materials and industrials - while small-cap ​stocks have also posted outsized increases.</p>   <p>"We're starting to get an embedded ‌leadership shift that's undeniable at this point," said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide. "This shift is now getting embedded into the psychology of investors."</p>    <p>Tech retains a major presence in U.S. indexes, including a one-third weighting in the S&amp;P 500. Even if tech weakness drags down the market barometers, investors have said wider participation in equity gains bodes well for the market's health.</p>  </div></div> <span><section>   <p><span>Opted out of sale / share </span></p>   </section> </span>  </article>      <section><header> </header>  <div><ul> <li><section><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/mortgages/article/when-will-mortgage-rates-go-down-to-5-201806162.html"><p><img alt="When will mortgage rates go down below 5%?

  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <p>Jesse Jackson, who died Tuesday aged 84, had a three-pronged career of <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/civil-rights/" target="_self">civil rights</a>, liberal missions and political activism, and his two White House bids in the 1980s helped lay the groundwork for the election of America's first Black president two decades later.</p> <p>Jackson's family announced his death, hailing "his unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions".</p> <p>As a close associate of <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/martin-luther-king-jr/" target="_self">Martin Luther King Jr</a> in the 1960s, a dynamic Black orator and a successful mediator in international disputes, the longtime Baptist minister expanded the space for African Americans on the national stage for more than six decades.</p> <p>Jackson was present for many consequential moments in the long battle for racial justice in the United States.</p> <p>He was with King in Memphis in 1968 when the civil rights leader was slain; openly wept in the crowd as <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/barack-obama/" target="_self">Barack Obama</a> celebrated his 2008 presidential election; and stood with <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/george-floyd/" target="_self">George Floyd</a>'s family in 2021 after a court convicted an ex-police officer of the unarmed Black man's murder.</p> <p>"My constituency is the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised," Jackson told the 1984 Democratic National Convention.</p> <p>He rose to prominence in the 1960s as a leader in King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference.</p> <p>He launched two social justice and activism organisations: Operation PUSH in 1971, and the National Rainbow Coalition a dozen years later. The two groups merged in 1996.</p> <h2>'Common ground'</h2> <p>It was Jackson's presidential runs&nbsp;– and one 1988 speech&nbsp;– that caught many Americans' attention and ensured that <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/african-american/" target="_self">African American</a> issues became fundamental to the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/democratic-party/" target="_self">Democratic Party</a> platform.</p> <p>His debut White House campaign supported a massive jobs expansion, ending the nation's "war on drugs" and its mandatory minimum sentences for drug users, and improving equality for women and minorities.</p> <p>Jackson finished third in the 1984 Democratic primaries&nbsp;– behind former vice president Walter Mondale and runner-up Gary Hart&nbsp;– making him the most successful Black presidential candidate until Obama.</p> <p>Mondale was trounced by Ronald Reagan in that year's general election.</p> <p>Four years later, Jackson was back on the convention stage after coming in second to nominee Michael Dukakis, urging Americans to find "common ground".</p> <p>"That's the challenge of our party tonight. Left wing, right wing ... It takes two wings to fly," he said, in a cadence reminiscent of King's.</p> <p>Jackson attacked what he called the "reverse Robin Hood" of a Reagan presidency that bestowed riches on the wealthy while leaving poor Americans struggling.</p> <p>"It gets dark sometimes, but the morning comes. Don't you surrender," he said as the crowd roared.&nbsp;</p> <p>While his electric speech raised Jackson's profile, the nation's gradual tilt to the right deprived him of major political influence in later years.</p> <p>And though his accomplishments were pioneering, his work was also tarnished by controversy.</p> <p>In 1984, he described New York as "Hymietown", using a pejorative term for Jews.</p> <p>One of Jackson's sons, former US congressman Jesse Jackson Jr, served prison time after pleading guilty in 2013 to taking some $750,000 in campaign money for his personal use.</p> <h2>No 'silver spoon'</h2> <p>Jackson's personal story began with hardship.</p> <p>He was born Jesse Louis Burns on October 8, 1941, in Greenville, South Carolina, to an unwed teen mother and a former professional boxer.</p> <p>He later adopted the last name of his stepfather Charles Jackson.</p> <p>"I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I had a shovel programmed for my hands," he once said.</p> <p>He excelled in his segregated high school and earned a football scholarship to the University of Illinois, but later transferred to the predominantly Black Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina, where he received a degree in sociology.</p> <p>In 1960, he participated in his first sit-in, in Greenville, and then joined the Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights marches in 1965, where he caught King's attention.</p> <p>Jackson later emerged as a mediator and envoy on several notable international fronts.</p> <p>He became a prominent advocate for ending apartheid in South Africa, and in the 1990s served as presidential special envoy for Africa for Bill Clinton.</p> <p>Missions to free US prisoners took him to Syria, Iraq and Serbia.</p> <p>But he ruffled some feathers in 2005 when he met in Venezuela with Hugo Chavez, and then spoke at the strongman's funeral in 2013.</p> <p>Jackson announced in 2017 that he was battling Parkinson's disease, and he began curtailing his public engagements.</p> <p>But he stood with George Floyd's family at their April 2021 press conference when a Minneapolis jury convicted Floyd's killer.</p> <p>The verdict brought "relief, but not a time for celebration", Jackson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p> <p>"It's a long struggle for racial equality in this country."</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AFP)</em></p> </div></div>

<li>March 4 launch – possible </li>
</ul> <p>The iPhone 16e arrived on February 19, 2025, so there was some hope that Apple could introduce its replacement on <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3052191/iphone-17e-set-to-launch-on-19-february-only-one-camera-but-finally-magsafe.html">February 19</a> a year later… With that date now here it’s looking unlikely. </p> <p>However, there is an “<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html">Apple Special Experience” coming up on March 4, 2026</a>, with media being invited to meet Apple execs in at least three global locations. It’s generally thought these meetings will tie to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products-iphone-ipad-mac-watch.html">new Apple product launches</a>. There are a number of other new product launches expected including a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3055278/2026-ipad-air-design-display-specs-release-price.html">refreshed iPad Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3030272/2026-ipad-a19-design-display-specs-release-price.html">new entry-level iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2655094/m5-macbook-air-design-display-specs-release-price.html">M5 MacBook Air,</a> <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2942089/macbook-pro-m5-pro-max-release-specs-price.html">M5 Pro/MaxMacBook Pro</a>, and a brand new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2854313/a18-pro-macbook-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html">low cost MacBook</a>.</p> <p>An event on March 4 – even if Apple isn’t referring to it as an event – is good timing for Apple to launch the new iPhone 17e because it is right in the middle of the Mobile World Congress. </p> <p>According to various <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/apple-plans-new-macbook-pro-iphone-17e-and-ipads-by-early-2026&amp;xcust=1-1-2881175-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2881175/iphone-17e-release-date-specs-features-price.html" target="_blank">reports</a>, the iPhone 17e has entered test production runs to prepare it for a <strong>spring 2026 release</strong>.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3025668/the-iphone-17e-could-arrive-within-weeks-without-a-notch.html">rumor in early January</a> said the iPhone 17e will go into production following CES (which ended January 9). This is unsurprising, as it follows the same pattern as the iPhone 16e.</p>
</div> <div>

<h2>iPhone 17e: Specs: What’s new for the iPhone 17e</h2> <ul>
<li>A19 with one fewer GPU than iPhone 17 – likely</li> <li>MagSafe support – likely</li> <li>C1X modem – possible</li> <li>256GB SSD – possible</li>
</ul> <p>Apple’s decision to introduce the iPhone 16e in February 2025 represented a significant shift in its product strategy, moving away from the sporadic release cycle of the iPhone SE toward a more predictable, annual “e-series” lineup. This transition was driven by several strategic imperatives, ranging from the necessity of supporting new AI technologies to the desire to test in-house hardware components in a lower-risk environment. </p> <p>To maintain a starting price of $599 while including the high-end A18 chip, Apple made several calculated omissions that differentiate the 16e from the standard iPhone 16. </p> <p>The iPhone 17e is expected to address some of the shortcomings of the iPhone 16e with a few key design refinements (a Dynamic Island is rumored), more storage at the entry-level, MagSafe support and an updated processor (the A19).</p> <p><strong>Processor</strong>: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and others have <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-10/apple-plans-new-macbook-pro-iphone-17e-and-ipads-by-early-2026&amp;xcust=1-1-2881175-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2881175/iphone-17e-release-date-specs-features-price.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that the iPhone 17e will have an A19 chip, which is no real surprise. If this is the case, it may be a slightly less powerful than the A19 chip used by the iPhone 17. Apple uses binned chips in the “e” series, so Tte A18 in the iPhone 16e has one fewer GPU core than the A18 in the standard iPhone 16; and the A19 in the iPhone 17e will likely have one fewer GPU core than the iPhone 17.</p> <p><strong>MagSafe</strong>: A December 2025 <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3014303/new-report-claims-apples-2026-27-iphone-roadmap-includes-7-new-models.html">report in The Information</a> claimed that Apple will add <strong>MagSafe support</strong> to the iPhone 17e, one of the features that is notably missing from the 16e. When we reviewed the 16e, the lack of MagSafe was one of its major shortcomings. A Macworld source in February 2026 claimed that the iPhone 17e will feature <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3052191/iphone-17e-set-to-launch-on-19-february-only-one-camera-but-finally-magsafe.html">25W MagSafe wireless charging</a>.</p> <p><strong>Modem</strong>: Apple’s <strong>C1 modem</strong> first appeared in the iPhone 16e, and rumors suggest the iPhone 17e will use the same modem. However, it could take the newer <strong>C1X modem</strong> as found in the iPhone 17 series, which is apparently two times faster than the C1 while using 30% less energy.</p> <p><strong>Storage</strong>: There are suggestions that the iPhone 17e could follow the iPhone 17 with 256GB at the starting point, up from 128GB. However, in February 2026 Apple leaker, John Prosser said he expects the baseline storage to stay at 128GB. </p>

<h2>iPhone 17e: How the iPhone 17e display will be different</h2> <ul>
<li>Dynamic Island instead of notch – possible</li>
</ul> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/iPhone-16e-and-iPhone-16-Plus.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="iPhone 16 Plus and iPhone 16e "><figcaption>Notch vs Dynamic Island.</figcaption></figure><p>David Price / Foundry</p></div> <p><strong>Screen size:</strong> The iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch screen, which is larger than that of the iPhone 16 (6.1-inch). The iPhone 17e is not expected to get a bigger screen. It will likely sport a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate, the same as the iPhone 16e. </p> <p><strong>Dynamic Island</strong>: Digital Chat Station <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2880793/rumored-iphone-17e-redesign-to-bring-dynamic-island-to-apples-budget-phone.html">reported</a> in August 2025 that the display will have a <strong>Dynamic Island</strong> – a change from the notch on the iPhone 16e.</p> <p><strong>OLED</strong>: In December 2025, Korean website, The Elec <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=44759&amp;xcust=1-1-2881175-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2881175/iphone-17e-release-date-specs-features-price.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that BOE will provide OLED displays to Apple for the iPhone 17e. BOE also provided OLEDs for the iPhone 16e. Samsung Display and LG Display are expected to also provide 17e displays. </p> <p><strong>Bezels</strong>: The display, according to The Elec, will have thinner bezels than the 16e.</p>
</div> <div>
<h2>iPhone 17e: Cameras</h2> <ul>
<li>18MP front camera with square sensor – likely</li>
</ul> <p>The iPhone 17e will likely continue to have a single <strong>48MP camera on the back</strong> but the <strong>12MP camera on the front</strong> (as seen on the iPhone 16e) could get an update in line with the iPhone 17 series). </p> <p>The front-facing cameras across the iPhone 17 range have all been updated to 18MP, so it is possible that the iPhone 17e will see the same update to the selfie camera. If so, it will also include a square sensor capable of taking photos in any orientation without requiring the user to rotate the phone.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Apple-iPhone-16e-REVIEW-Visual-Intelligence.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Apple iPhone 16e REVIEW Visual Intelligence"><figcaption><p>The notch may be replaced by the Dynamic Island in the iPhone 17e.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry | Alex Walker-Todd</p></div>
</div>
</div> <div>
<h2>iPhone 17e: Design &amp; Colors</h2> <ul>
<li>Digital Island likely to be only visible external change</li>
</ul> <p><strong>Colors</strong>: There have been no reports relating to the iPhone 17e’s colors. The iPhone 16e is available in <strong>black or white</strong>, and we expect the same for the iPhone 17e.</p> <p><strong>Design</strong>: No changes are expected for the design, although, as mentioned above, the new iPhone 17e could have a Digital Island instead of the notch at the top of the screen. There is a possibility that the there could be thinner bezels than the 16e, according to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=44759&amp;xcust=1-1-2881175-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2881175/iphone-17e-release-date-specs-features-price.html" target="_blank">The Elec</a>.</p>
</div> <div>
<h2>iPhone 17e: Price</h2> <ul>
<li>Starting at $599</li>
</ul> <p>A January 2026 <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://wccftech.com/iphone-17e-supply-chain-efficiency-boost-could-help-apple-maintain-or-lower-price/&amp;xcust=1-1-2881175-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2881175/iphone-17e-release-date-specs-features-price.html" target="_blank">report</a> on Wccftech suggests that Apple has been able to reduce costs for the new iPhone 17e, so that the price won’t increase. This is thanks to lower costs for the OLED panels Apple is using. </p> <p>The iPhone 16e starts at $599/£599, and Apple is expected to price the <strong>iPhone 17e at $599</strong> as well, though no reports have been made so far. Tariffs and production cost increases may affect the price, but since the “e” series is considered Apple’s lowest-priced iPhone, the price would not exceed that of the iPhone 17, which starts at $799, and the iPhone 16, whose price has been reduced to start at $699.</p>

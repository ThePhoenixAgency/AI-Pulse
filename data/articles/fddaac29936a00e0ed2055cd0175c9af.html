    <div><div>   <p>See which banks are currently paying the highest CD rates. If you’re looking for a secure place to store your savings, a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/best-cd-rates-201308688.html">certificate of deposit</a> (CD) may be a great choice. These accounts often provide higher interest rates than traditional checking and savings accounts. However, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/best-cd-rates-201308688.html">CD rates</a> can vary widely. Learn more about CD rates today and where to find <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/high-yield-cds-220352310.html">high-yield CDs</a> with the best rates available.</p>      <p>Today’s CD rates vary quite a bit. In general, however, CD rates have been declining for quite some time due to the Fed’s decision to cut its benchmark rate three times in the later part of 2024 and its additional three rate cuts in 2025. Even so, some banks are still offering competitive CD rates.</p>   <p>For those that are, top rates reach about 4% APY. This is especially true for shorter terms of one year or less.</p>   <p>Today, the highest CD rate is 4% APY. This rate is offered by <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/review/marcus-by-goldman-sachs-review-185632289.html">Marcus by Goldman Sachs</a> on its 1-year CD.</p>   <p>Here is a look at some of the best CD rates available today from our verified partners:</p>      <p>Compare these rates to the national average as of January 2026 (the most recent data available from the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/index.html" target="_blank">FDIC</a>):</p>      <p>Compared with today’s top CD rates, national averages are much lower. This highlights the importance of shopping around for the best CD rates before <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/how-to-open-a-cd-165257375.html">opening an account</a>.</p>      <p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/best-online-banks-225003422.html">Online banks</a> and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/what-is-neobank-is-it-safe-123234143.html">neobanks</a> are financial institutions that operate solely via the web. That means they have lower overhead costs than traditional brick and mortar banks. As a result, they’re able to pass those savings on to their customers in the form of higher interest rates on deposit accounts (including CDs) and lower fees. If you’re looking for the best CD rates available today, an online bank is a great place to start.</p>   <p>However, online banks aren’t the only financial institutions offering competitive CD rates. It’s also worth checking with <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/what-is-a-credit-union-191721010.html">credit unions</a>. As not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions return their profits to customers, who are also member-owners. Although many credit unions have strict membership requirements that are limited to those who belong to certain associations or work or live in certain areas, there are also several credit unions that just about anyone can join.</p>         <p>Whether or not you should put your money in a CD depends on your savings goals. CDs are considered a safe and stable savings vehicle — they <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/can-you-lose-money-in-a-cd-155056809.html">don’t lose money</a> (in most cases), are backed by federal insurance, and allow you to lock in today’s best rates.</p>   <p>However, there are some drawbacks to consider. First, you must keep your money on deposit for the full term, otherwise you’ll be subject to an early withdrawal penalty. If you want flexible access to your funds, a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/best-high-yield-savings-account-171334498.html">high-yield savings account</a> or <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/4-percent-interest-money-market-accounts-160154289.html">money market account</a> might be a better choice.</p>   <p>Additionally, although today’s CD rates are high by historical standards, they don’t match the returns you could achieve by investing your money in the market. If you’re saving for a long-term goal such as retirement, a CD won’t provide the growth you need to reach your savings goal within a reasonable time frame.</p>   <p><em>Read more: </em><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/short-term-cd-192725959.html"><em>Short- or long-term CD: Which is best for you?</em></a></p>         </div></div>

    <div><div><p>Australia has declared its support for US action against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon and “to prevent Iran continuing to threaten international peace and security”.</p><p>But Australia’s department of foreign affairs (Dfat) has warned of the risk of “reprisal attacks and further escalation” across the Middle East after the attack.</p><p>In a statement issued on Saturday evening, Anthony Albanese said: “Australia stands with the brave people of Iran in their struggle against oppression.”</p><p>The prime minister said Iran’s ruling regime had been a “destabilising force” for decades through its ballistic missile and nuclear programs, support for armed proxies, and “brutal acts of violence and intimidation”.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p><p>Iran directed at least two attacks on Australian soil in 2024, Albanese said, which targeted the Jewish community and were intended to “create fear, divide our society and challenge our sovereignty”.</p><p>He also highlighted the Iranian regime’s “brutal crackdown on its own people, leaving thousands of Iranian civilians dead”.</p><p>“A regime that relies on the repression and murder of its own people to retain power is without legitimacy,” Albanese said.</p><p>The prime minister said Iran’s nuclear program was a threat to global peace and security, and “we support the United States acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent Iran continuing to threaten international peace and security”.</p><p>He said Australia has updated its travel advice for Israel and Lebanon to “do not travel” and Australians in those countries should leave now if it is safe to do so. Dfat has activated its crisis centre to support Australians in the Middle East.</p><p>Shortly after the attacks began, Dfat updated its “Smartraveller” website’s entry on Iran, confirming that “there have been airstrikes on Iran, including in Tehran and other locations”.</p><p>“There is a risk of reprisal attacks and further escalation across the region,” <a href="https://www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/middle-east/iran">the website said</a>.</p><p>An hour later, the department also updated its warnings for Israel, highlighting a specific “risk of reprisal attacks on Israel” and advising people there to “try to get to an underground shelter if possible, or at minimum seek a shelter close to ground level”.</p><p>It noted reports that Israeli airspace was closed.</p><p>The department’s Iran update added that “Closure of airspace around transit hubs may impact flights globally, causing delays and cancellations. We continue to advise do not travel to Iran and leave Iran as soon as possible, if it’s safe to do so. Regional tensions remain high and there continues to be a risk of military conflict.</p><p>“If you remain in Iran, be prepared to shelter in place for an extended period. Make sure you have supplies of water, food and medication. The security situation in Iran is extremely volatile. Avoid public gatherings and protests. Australians, including dual nationals, are at a high risk of being detained.”</p><p>The Australian embassy’s operations in Iran are suspended.</p><figure></figure><p>Just a few hours before the attack began, Australia’s foreign minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/penny-wong">Penny Wong</a> reposted on X the latest updated warnings for Australians in the Middle East.</p><p>The warnings advised of the “risk of military conflict”.</p><p>“If you’re in Israel or Lebanon, consider leaving while commercial options to depart are still available,” the advice said. “Conflict could lead to airspace closures, flight cancellations and other disruptions.”</p><p>On Saturday evening Dfat also updated the warnings for Lebanon, adding that “there have been military air strikes on Southern Lebanon”. It was initially unclear whether these were related to the Israel/US operation against Iran.</p><p>On Wednesday last week, Australia announced it was withdrawing all the dependents of Australian officials from Israel and Lebanon “due to the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East”, and offered voluntary evacuation for the dependents of officials in Jordan, Qatar and the UAE.</p><p>On Saturday evening, Australia’s opposition leader, Angus Taylor, reacted to the attack on social media by denouncing the “theocratic Iranian regime” which he said was “authoritarian, antisemitic and abhorrent”.</p><p>“It wants nuclear weapons, seeks the destruction of Israel, has encouraged terrorism through its proxies – Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis – and has supplied weapons to Russia to support Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. It is also responsible for acts of foreign interference in Australia and igniting antisemitism,” he wrote.</p><p>“Since 1979, the revolutionary Islamic government in Tehran has oppressed, imprisoned and murdered Iranians. We pray for the Iranian people at this time.</p><p>“May courage prevail.”</p><p>Ted O’Brien, deputy leader of the opposition, said the Coalition was closely watching events in Iran and awaiting briefings from the government.</p><p>“We urge Australians in the region to pay close attention to official advice,” he said. “Our position is clear: Israel has the right to defend itself, and Iranians have the right to live free of oppression.”</p><figure></figure></div></div>

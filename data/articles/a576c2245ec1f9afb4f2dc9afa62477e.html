    <div><div>   <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the most vocal advocates for consumer financial protections, has recently raised the alarm over the Trump administration’s push to allow cryptocurrency investments into ordinary workers’ retirement plans.</p>   <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order in 2025 opening the door to so-called “alternative assets” to be part of retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans (1). However, the notorious volatility of these digital assets coupled with Trump’s own involvement in the crypto industry seems to have caught Senator Warren’s attention.</p>         <ul><li> <p>Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — <a href="https://moneywise.com/managing-money/retirement-planning/dave-ramsey-warns-nearly-50-of-americans-are-making-1?throw=DM1_yahoo&amp;placement_syn=placement_1&amp;utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;utm_medium=BL&amp;utm_campaign=162318&amp;utm_content=syn_651030ab-a949-44f6-ba6a-d1355e67b3c4" target="_blank">here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP</a></p> </li><li> <p>Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now <a href="https://moneywise.com/investing/real-estate/invest-vacation-rental-homes-v?throw=DM2_yahoo&amp;placement_syn=placement_1&amp;utm_source=syn_oath_mon&amp;utm_medium=BL&amp;utm_campaign=162318&amp;utm_content=syn_228b3bb9-ca29-4a82-8e48-38d988d54a42" target="_blank">become a landlord for as little as $100</a> — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Here’s how you can lose huge sums of money relatively quickly in an investment vehicle designed for reliable returns — not explosive volatility.</p>      <p>At its core, the 401(k) plan is designed for long-term retirement savings. Roughly 70 million American workers rely on these plans for their nest eggs, according to Fidelity (3).</p>   <p>In contrast, the extreme volatility of cryptocurrencies make them better suited to traders and speculators than retirement savers. Despite its comparisons to “digital gold,” the CME Group found that the price of Bitcoin moves up and down somewhat alongside the movements of the stock market, which means it is far more volatile than a reserve currency or hard asset (4).</p>       <p>Cryptocurrency has also underperformed stocks in recent years. As of Feb. 11, 2026, Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two leading cryptocurrencies, have underperformed the Nasdaq-100 and S&amp;P 500 by wide margins over the last five years — and that’s not even including the dividends you earn from stocks. Put simply, you would have made more money by buying a simple and cheap index fund in 2021.</p>  </div></div>

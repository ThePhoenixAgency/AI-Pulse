  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <p>In what is the least surprising headline you'll read today, Jerry Bruckheimer is working on a sequel to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-tv">Apple TV</a>'s smash hit "F1." Reports claiming that this is absolute confirmation that it's coming are premature.
</p><p>Face it, there's going to be a sequel to "F1: The Movie." Eventually.
</p><p>Hollywood, and Apple like money, after all.
</p><p>No streamer or studio in the world would pass on a sequel to title that is their <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/29/f1-the-movie-is-officially-the-most-watched-film-apple-tv-history">most-watched movie</a>, and which earned over <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/08/25/f1-the-movie-drives-past-600m-at-the-international-box-office">$600 million</a> at the box office.
</p><p>Now after <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/04/formula-1-ceo-hints-toward-a-possible-f1-movie-sequel-on-apple-tv">previous hints</a> from various people involved in the first film, there is more information, closer to the source. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8jx7kvm4leo">has told</a> <em>BBC News</em> that "we're working on a sequel." </p><p>He wouldn't talk further about details for the sequel. But, he did say that he was "surprised" yet delighted at the film getting a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars.
</p><p>"It was a long journey to get the movie made because we had to endure a couple of strikes — but in the end, the movie entertained audiences around the world," he said. "I never worked with Brad Pitt before and it's really a thrill to work with Brad."
</p><h2>What happens next</h2><p>Even if no one at Bruckheimer's production company or Apple was talking about a sequel before "F1" became a hit, they have doubtlessly been discussing it since. </p><p>However, despite what on the face of it seems like an obvious move to make, there are complications.
</p><p>One is that the sheer success of the first film is guaranteed to see all parties wanting increased fees. It is certain that every role, both in front of and behind the cameras, will have to be renegotiated.
</p><p>This is one reason why TV shows sign actors and key production staff to multi-year contracts. It means no matter what the success of a project is, all of those players are already locked-in on the same or similar terms as before.
</p><p>Then to an extent, there is the issue of finding a story for the second movie. Bruckheimer alluded to this when speaking about how he's working on multiple projects including sequels to "Top Gun," "Heat 2," and more.
</p><p>"We've got a lot of things in the hopper," he said. "We're just waiting for one of them to get a great script and get it made."
</p><p>While he said that specifically about his whole slate of projects, it's likely to apply to the "F1" sequel as well. </p><p>Sequels tend be business decisions as much as artistic, though. This is why, for instance, the makers of "Airplane!" were told a sequel was going to be made with or without them.
</p><p>So there is unquestionably a strong business case pushing forward an "F1" sequel. That sequel has to make financial sense — including any costs of Apple potentially coming out of its <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/06/26/apple-wants-total-control-over-distributing-films-like-f1">previous distribution deal</a> with Warner Bros.
</p><p>But whether or not an "F1" sequel is made, Bruckheimer did also speak of a separate Apple TV project. He mentioned a "very interesting" UFO project.

"></a></p><p><span>Apple is all-in on F1. Tim Cook waved the checkered flag at the U.S. Grand Prix. </span></p></div><p>Even before "F1" was released, Apple TV had reportedly <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/03/25/apple-tv-spends-millions-to-hire-f1-team-for-ufo-thriller">spent millions</a> to hire its team to make this as-yet untitled UFO thriller. Reportedly, Bruckheimer alone is set to receive a producing fee in the mid-seven figures.
</p><p>Bruckheimer was speaking at the annual Academy Awards luncheon for Oscar nominees that took place in Los Angeles on February 10, 2026. As well as Best Picture, "F1" <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/22/f1-driving-apples-oscar-awards-ambitions-in-2026">is nominated</a> in the editing, sound, and visual effects categories.
</p><p>The winners of the 98th Academy Awards will be announced on March 15, 2026.
</p><p>Bruckheimer's comments are at least more positive than Apple's to date. Speaking at the Apple TV press day, the company's <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/eddy-cue">Eddy Cue</a> responded to questions about an "F1" sequel with <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/21/apples-formula-1-racing-partnership-will-go-far-beyond-streaming">only a plug</a> for the streamer's sports coverage.
</p><p>"We've got 24 F1 movies this year on Apple TV," he said, referring to the number of Formula 1 races. "I don't know what the ending is. It's the best unscripted drama in the world."</p> </div></div>

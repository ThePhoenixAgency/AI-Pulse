<div> <p>As a trillion-dollar company with one of the most recognizable brands in the world, I don’t think <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> has a lot to worry about. But when I looked at the results of a recent poll I ran, asking you, dear readers, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/have-your-say-do-you-actually-use-apple-intelligence">if you use Apple Intelligence</a>, the results made me grunt an ‘ooph’.</p><p>That’s because a hefty 96% of respondents selected the ‘Nope, it’s not for me’ option, leaving a mere 4% to select ‘Yes, it’s pretty good’ as a response.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NYX5ZkRW9YRNe44WBePz9D.png" alt="An image showing the poll results of readers who actually use or don&amp;#039;t use Apple Intelligence">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yet I don’t find myself ever really using Apple Intelligence with any gusto. I keep notification summaries on just for the hell of it, despite them not exactly being the most accurate. Occasionally, the summary will misinterpret a cluster of notifications and serve up a few words that set a sense of dread or panic in me until I properly open up a message or email and find out that all is fine.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/how-the-heck-did-phones-become-so-boring-looking-at-you-apple-and-samsung-but-at-least-theres-hope-on-the-horizon">I’m just one tired man who’s perhaps a little bored with phones</a>; those of you who are more actively engaging with the latest smartphone software features perhaps demand a lot more from AI tools. And it would seem to me that Apple is still doing its iPhone users a disservice.</p><p>“Apple can’t figure out their AI strategy to save their life,” said a commenter going by the handle of ‘laughfactory'. “I love Apple stuff, but they’re WAY off-base on AI.”</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><p>I’d say the commenter has a point, and with such a high percentage of people not looking favorably at Apple Intelligence, I’d also say that Apple has cause to be a bit embarrassed, even though it’s unlikely to be stung by such failure in a significant monetary fashion.</p><p>And as there's a movement towards '<a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/best-ai-phone">AI phones</a>' and other actually smart tech, I do think <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/tim-cook">Tim Cook</a> and his Cupertino crew should be a little worried that Apple could get left behind in the AI world.</p><p>There’s hope on the horizon with the news that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/ai-platforms-assistants/apples-google-gemini-deal-is-the-most-disappointing-thing-to-come-out-of-apple-since-the-newton">Apple will tap into Google Gemini</a> to give Siri and Apple Intelligence a boost in smarts, but that’s not happened yet. And now that there’s a rumor that iOS 27 might be delayed, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/ios/siri-will-officially-become-apples-biggest-ever-embarrassment-if-these-new-ios-27-delay-rumors-are-true">Siri could soon become one of Apple’s biggest ever embarrassments</a>.</p><hr><p><em></em><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

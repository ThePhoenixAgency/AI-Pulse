<p><strong>Linux Mint developers are considering a change to the distro’s traditional six-month release schedule.</strong></p>



<p>Project leader Clement Lefebvre <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4991" target="_blank">thinks</a> moving to a longer development cycle would allow the team to spend more time developing features, rather than fixing and testing to meet its current deadlines.</p>



<p>If the distro does reduce its release rate, it could affect the release date of Linux Mint 23 later this year, meaning an end to the traditional biannual release cadence for its main edition. It’s unclear if such a shift would affect Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE). </p>



<p>For fixed-schedule Linux distributions like Ubuntu, a predictable release cadence helps to focus engineering priorities. It also give users stability, knowing major changes won’t appear out of thin air.</p>



<p>Not all distros opt for fix-releases, though. Rolling release distros favour constant flux, while others prefer a ‘ready when it’s ready’ approach, like elementaryOS.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>A slower release pace would match Linux Mint’s considered approach to OS development</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Codenames are also on Lefebvre’s mind.</p>



<p>Linux Mint reached the end of its alphabetical codenames with the <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2026/01/linux-mint-22-3-released">Linux Mint 22.3</a> “Zena” release in January, marking the final ‘Z’ release. Slowing down the release rate might allow for more creative choices going forward.</p>



<p>For Lefebvre, a slower pace would match Linux Mint’s considered approach to development, i.e., taking time to do things properly, with its users in mind.</p>



<p><em>“I think one of our strengths is that we’re doing things incrementally and changing things slowly”</em>, he says, citing past decisions to stick with LTS releases, reject Snap packages and create alternatives to upstream GNOME software as examples of the project’s independence.</p>



<p>Committing to releasing major updates every six months – barring the odd delay – works well in delivering incremental, iterative improvements, but does it cap ambition? Lefebvre thinks it might. </p>



<p>Major feature development is harder to do when you’re testing and releasing most of the time. Besides which, Linux Mint thinks of itself as more than <em>just</em> a distribution. “We’re first and foremost an operating system: a product, a user experience,” Lefebvre adds.</p>



<p>We’ll learn more details about on the plans for Linux Mint 23 following the release of Ubuntu 26.04 LTS in April, as this will form the package base of the next release. </p>



<p>If Linux Mint does switch to an extended development cycle, it would mean longer waits between major updates. But if Lefebvre’s ambition is any indication, the change would let Mint focus on work that doesn’t fit neatly into a six‑month window.</p>

    <div><div><p>Strategy founder Michael Saylor has revealed the firm plans to convert its $6 billion in bond debt into equity, a move that reduces debt on the balance sheet.</p><p>“Strategy can withstand a drawdown in BTC price to $8,000 and still have sufficient assets to fully cover our debt,” stated the firm on X on Sunday, <a href="https://x.com/saylor/status/2023107433577717852" target="_blank">prompting</a> Saylor’s response. </p><p>The Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) treasury company currently holds $49 billion in Bitcoin reserves with a stash of 714,644 BTC. </p><p>Its convertible debt is around $6 billion, so BTC would need to fall around 88% for the two to be equal, and it still has enough to cover the debt, the firm explained. </p><p>Equitizing <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-convertible-senior-notes-how-microstrategy-uses-them-to-buy-bitcoin">convertible debt</a> means converting the bond debt into equity as stock shares rather than repaying it in cash, essentially turning bondholders into shareholders.</p><p>The move would reduce debt pressure on the company, but it can also dilute existing shareholders because new stock is issued.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c649c-42a7-7c22-b496-df1b126c328c.jpg" /><figcaption><em>The firm claims convertible debt notes are fully covered even if Bitcoin tanks 88%.

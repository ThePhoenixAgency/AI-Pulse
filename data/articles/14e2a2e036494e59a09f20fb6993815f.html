<div> <p>Raspberry Pi’s first product of 2026 is an update of the 2024 AI HAT+, but this newer version, another collaboration with Hailo, now sees the Hailo 10H AI chip running the show, along with 8GB of onboard RAM. The new AI HAT+ 2 takes the strain of AI workloads away from the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-5">Raspberry Pi 5</a>’s Arm CPU, but this all comes at a price of $130. With your Raspberry Pi already costing much more than the original $35 — of course, the spec has vastly improved over the years — you could already be hitting the $200 mark for just a Pi and AI HAT+ 2. Does the performance warrant the price? There's only one way to find out!</p><h2>Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 Specifications</h2><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><span>Header Cell - Column 0 </span></th><th><p>AI HAT+ 2</p></th><th><p>AI HAT+</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>AI Accelerator</strong></p></td><td><p>Hailo-10H</p></td><td><p>Hailo-8, Hailo-8L</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>TOPS</strong></p></td><td><p>40 (INT4) 26 (Image Inference / Computer Vision)</p></td><td><p>13 or 26 (Image Inference / Computer Vision)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Price</strong></p></td><td><p>$130</p></td><td><p>13 TOPS $70</p><p>26 TOPS $110</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h2>Unboxing and Setup</h2><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>7</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LHcZshJxZjSy5jET9EVrfk.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2"></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>The retail box follows the same design language as the many other Raspberry Pi product boxes that I have opened. At a glance, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this was the same Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ as released previously, and opening the box doesn’t help as the boards are very similar. The new AI HAT+ 2 requires the included heatsink. Yes, this heatsink is for the HAT, not the Raspberry Pi 5. Your Pi 5 will also need cooling, and the official Raspberry Pi and Argon low-profile coolers will fit under the HAT. The included plastic standoffs and GPIO header extension work, but the GPIO connection is a little too loose for my liking. The resulting GPIO connections, using DuPoint style connectors, also feel a little too loose.</p><p>Connecting the board to the Raspberry Pi 5 is simple. Just unlock the PCIe connection on the Pi 5, push in the ribbon cable, lock it down, and then secure the board to the standoffs and GPIO. There is a cut-out for connecting the official Raspberry Pi Camera and an official display. Connect up your keyboard, mouse, HDMI, Ethernet, and finally power, then boot to the Raspberry Pi desktop, remembering of course to enable PCIe Gen 3 via “raspi-config.” We’re using the latest Debian “Trixie” based image and have a custom installation process as our review unit predates the official software repositories. The end-user software experience will be streamlined for release.</p><h2>What Models Can the Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 Hailo 10H Run?</h2><p>Using the provided installation instructions, we ran hailo-ollama and then queried the available and compatible models for the Hailo 10H powering the kit.</p><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><p>Model</p></th><th><p>Used for</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>deepseek_r1_ distill_qwen:1.5b</p></td><td><p>Math, logical reasoning, coding.

Just change the “model” to one of the five available.</p><pre><code>curl --silent http://localhost:8000/api/pull \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ -d '{ "model": "qwen2:1.5b", "stream" : true }'
</code></pre><p>The 8GB of onboard DDR4X RAM means that larger models will generally work better as the Raspberry Pi’s own RAM is untouched. So models up to 8GB should load without incident, even on Raspberry Pi 5s with less than 8GB. This opens up cheaper AI projects, technically.</p><p>You still need to pay $130 for the AI HAT+ 2, but a $50 1GB, $55 2GB, or $77 4GB Raspberry Pi 5 is now a viable AI platform, negating the need to buy a $105 8GB or the frankly frightening $160 for a 16GB Raspberry Pi 5.</p><div><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><h2>Comparing the Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 With the AI HAT+</h2><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>5</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i25epp2sqNnaUK2aEP93Bj.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2"></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>So why the new board? That is down to Large Language Models (LLM), an AI that is trained on huge amounts of text data and is used to understand, process, and respond to human language. The AI HAT+ 2 is mainly aimed at LLMs, whereas the older AI HAT+ is for image-based AI projects. The AI HAT+ 2 demo code supplied by Raspberry Pi leans heavily on creating our own local LLM using qwen2:1.5b but you can also use DeepSeek or Qwen models that are distilled via DeepSeek.</p><p>The onboard 8GB of RAM and powerful AI processing chip take the strain off the Raspberry Pi 5’s CPU and RAM. We can also use that power for image processing. If you’ve not got the original AI HAT+, then having good image processing and a viable LLM platform makes the $130 price tag easier to swallow.</p><p>The two boards may look similar, but they don’t work in the same way. The AI HAT+ was all about image-based AI processing, and the 26 TOPS of the onboard Hailo 8L (13 Tops for the cheaper Hailo8 model) is very similar in performance to the AI HAT+ 2. Using the rpicam-hello suite of examples, we tested compatibility with the AI HAT+ 2, and we are pleased to say that object identification and pose detection worked as expected. While we have no metrics to show the difference, the performance of the AI HAT+ 2 was smooth, and there were no camera issues. Where there were issues, they were largely software-based. "HailoRT not ready!" shows that Hailo's software is playing catch-up to the hardware, which has happened before. Hailo, Raspberry Pi and the community will ultimately fix this gap, but early adopters need to be aware.</p><h2>Comparing AI HAT+ 2 and Raspberry Pi 5 CPU Performance</h2><p>Because we cannot directly test the AI HAT+ 2 and the AI HAT+, we need to fallback to testing the AI HAT+ 2 versus the Arm CPU of the Raspberry Pi 5. For this test, we will use the qwen2:1.5b language model and pose some questions relating to general knowledge, then specific programming tasks using Python. Installation of qwen2:1.5b was made via ollama.</p><p>The first question is “What is Tom’s Hardware?”</p><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th><span>Header Cell - Column 0 </span></th><th><p>AI HAT+ 2</p></th><th><p>Raspberry Pi 5 Arm CPU</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Time to answer</p></td><td><p>13.58 seconds</p></td><td><p>22.93 seconds</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Accuracy</p></td><td><p>Incorrect</p></td><td><p>Incorrect</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Arm CPU Utilization</p></td><td></td><td><p>Hitting 100% on all cores</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h2>AI HAT+ 2 Response</h2><p>“Tom's Hardware is a hardware retailer with stores in the United States and Canada.

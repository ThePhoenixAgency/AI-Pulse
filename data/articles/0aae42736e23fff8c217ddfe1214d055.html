<p>Peter Steinberger, who created the AI personal assistant now known as <a href="https://openclaw.ai/">OpenClaw</a>, has joined OpenAI.</p>

<p>Previously known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/27/everything-you-need-to-know-about-viral-personal-ai-assistant-clawdbot-now-moltbot/">OpenClaw achieved viral popularity</a> over the past few weeks with its promise to be the “AI that actually does things,” whether that’s managing your calendar, booking flights, or even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/30/openclaws-ai-assistants-are-now-building-their-own-social-network/">joining a social network full of other AI assistants</a>. (The name changed the first time after Anthropic threatened legal action over its similarity to Claude, then changed again because Steinberger liked the new name better.)</p>







<p>In <a href="https://steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw">a blog post announcing his decision</a> to join OpenAI, the Austrian developer said that while he might have been able to turn OpenClaw into a huge company, “It’s not really exciting for me.”</p>

<p>“What I want is to change the world, not build a large company[,] and teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest way to bring this to everyone,” Steinberger said.</p>

<p>OpenAI CEO <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/2023150230905159801?s=46&amp;t=45_xAnRsdQP1GVqYv9Gdbw">Sam Altman posted on X</a> that in his new role, Steinberger will “drive the next generation of personal agents.” As for OpenClaw, Altman said it will “live in a foundation as an open source project that OpenAI will continue to support”</p>

  <div class="content"><p>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. This weekend's PC game deals include a massive number of multiplayer games on sale, a bundle full of horror titles, double freebies, and more. Pulasthi Ariyasinghe Neowin @LoneWolfSL · Feb 14, 2026 04:30 EST Weekend PC Game Deals is where the hottest gaming deals from all over the internet are gathered into one place every week for your consumption. So kick back, relax, and hold on to your wallets. Let's start the weekend special by looking at a couple of freebies. The Epic Games Store began a big giveaway this week that carried two well-received detective games, namely Nobody Wants to Die and The Darkside Detective: A Fumble in the Dark. From the duo, Nobody Wants to Die is a first-person adventure set in the future where you'll be recreating crime scenes and interviewing suspects to grab a serial killer. For those looking for a more old-school experience, they can jump into this The Darkside Detective entry, which is a retro-style point-and-click title featuring nine humorous supernatural cases. The two giveaways will be active until February 19, which is when Return To Ash and STALCRAFT: X will become the next freebies. The Humble Store's newest bundle is Valentine's Day themed, but with a horror twist. The Love You to Death Bundle carries nine items with a $12 price tag. It carries Have a Nice Death, Ghost Watchers, Devour, Iron Lung, Lunacid, FAITH: The Unholy Trinity, The Bridge Curse 2: The Extrication, Life Eater, and Without a Dawn to keep as Steam keys. The bundle has almost three weeks left on its counter before going away.

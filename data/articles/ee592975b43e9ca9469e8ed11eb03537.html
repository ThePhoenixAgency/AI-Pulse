<p>X is down for many users right now, with thousands reporting that the social media site is serving up error messages and isn't working for them.</p><p>The issues started at around 8.02am ET / 1.02pm GMT, when a large spike in reports appeared on <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/twitter/" target="_blank">Downdetector</a> in the US and UK. At the time of writing, those reports are at over 11,000 in the US and over 3,300 in the UK.</p>

<p>The number of Downdetector reports for X is continuing to drop, which is a promising sign – it's now down to just over 25,000 reports in the US, from a peak of just over 41,000 at 8.42am ET / 1.42pm GMT.</p><p>Yet many of us are continuing to get error messages, so I thought I'd bring you one I haven't seen before to tide us over. The one above in the Android app explains that posts can't be retrieved and to "please try again later".</p><p>Seeing as X is making a habit of going down these days, I might start collecting these error messages and start a bingo game.</p>

<p>Seeing as X is still down for most of us right now, it feels timely to mention another recent X problem that had a somewhat comical conclusion.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/twitter-x-color-blue" target="_blank">Futurism</a>, many users were recently puzzled to discover that the site's dark blue 'dim' theme had disappeared. When they complained on X (when the site was working), X’s head of product Nikita Bier replied that "we don’t have the capacity to support more than two colors right now", but that "we are looking into lightening the black on web.”</p><p>Leaving aside that baffling reply, is today's outage related to X's promised color tweaks? No, but it is another amusing X anecdote that suggests the site isn't exactly firing on all cylinders right now. In fact, none of its cylinders are firing, because it's still very much down right now...</p>

<p>There's been a small dip in the number of Downdetector reports for X in the last 15 minutes or so. It's now down to just over 37,000 reports, from a high of 42,845 at 8.34am ET / 1.34pm GMT.</p><p>It still isn't working for me at the time of writing with the desktop site showing a black screen, but that could mean a fix is working for some regions.</p><p>If you're in the US and are looking for something to replace your daily doomscroll, I'd recommend checking out our <a href="https://www.techradar.com/live/news/presidents-day-sale-live-2026">pick of the Presidents' Day deals</a>. They're more fun than looking at a black screen, anyway.</p>

<p>Our hopes that this might be a short, sharp blip appear to be fading – reports of problems on X continue to grow, with the number now at a massive 41,000 in the US. It's down for thousands in the UK too, during the critical lunch hour doomscroll period.</p><p>During the site's last big outage in November 2025, Cloudflare issues were the culprit. However, that doesn't seem to be case so far this time, with some outage spikes on Downdetector for both Cloudflare and AWS very minor. The picture should hopefully become clearer soon.</p>

<p>If you're seeing the message above for X on desktop or in the mobile app, you're not alone.</p><p>The social media site appears to be experiencing a big Monday outage, with the reports of issues in the US now at over 40,000 on Downdetector.</p><p>That's the kind of number we haven't seen since its last big outage in November 2025. Let's hope for the sake of memes and hot-takes that this one doesn't last as long...</p>

</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Downdetector)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It seems most people (including us) are struggling to get X to load right now – there's currently over 23,000 reports on Downdetector (above) in the US, and over 6,400 in the UK.</p><p>The outage is affecting both the app and website, with neither working for us. We're getting a "something went wrong" message, with no posts loading.</p>

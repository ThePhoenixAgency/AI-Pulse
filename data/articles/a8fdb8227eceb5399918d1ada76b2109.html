So I'm not thrilled," Trump said in his first comments on negotiations in Geneva that broke up on Thursday without a deal.</p></div><div><p>The US president stressed that he did not want to use military force against Iran, but said sometimes "you have to".</p></div><div><p>Concern over the prospect of US strikes against Iran led a number of countries to issue warnings to their citizens in the region on Friday.</p></div><div><p>The UK temporarily withdrew staff from its embassy in Tehran and updated its travel guidance to advise against "all but essential travel" to Israel.</p></div><div><p>Countries including China, India and Canada urged<b> </b>their citizens to leave Iran as soon as possible due to the prospect<b> </b>of hostilities. Germany advised "urgently" against travel to Israel while France reiterated its advice not to do so.</p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, the US embassy in Israel told some non-emergency staff and their families they could leave the country,<b> </b>advising that they may wish to do so "while commercial flights are available".</p></div><div><p>He has ordered the largest US military build-up in the Middle East since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, while Iran has vowed to respond to an attack with force.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3d14/live/612adfe0-13ee-11f1-82ca-eb805bf206d6.jpg.webp" alt="EPA British Embassy in Tehran, Iran, August 23rd 2015"><span>EPA</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The UK Foreign Office said the decision was a 'precautionary measure' (file photo)</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>US and Iranian officials made "significant progress" in the high-stakes nuclear talks in Geneva, Oman's foreign minister said on Thursday, but the chances of a deal that could avert a war remain unclear.</p></div><div><p>Badr Albusaidi, who was mediating the indirect talks, said the two sides planned to resume negotiations "soon" after consultations in their capitals, and technical-level discussions would take place next week in Vienna.</p></div><div><p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led his country's delegation, said "good progress" had been made but while there had been agreement on some issues, differences remained on others.</p></div><div><p>He said more negotiations would happen in a less than a week. President Trump's commments on Friday were the first official reaction from the US.</p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, the State Department announced US Secretary of State Marco Rubio would travel to Israel on Monday, where he is expected to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p></div><div><p>Rubio will discuss "a range of regional priorities" including Iran, a spokesman said.</p></div><div><p>Earlier on Friday US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee advised embassy staff who wished to leave Israel to "do so TODAY", the New York Times reported.</p></div><div><p>He<b> </b>reportedly said in email there was "no need to panic, but for those desiring to leave, it's important to make plans to depart sooner rather than later".</p></div><div><p>A statement on the embassy's website said they "may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available".</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d5f3/live/7cc33510-13f1-11f1-801d-ed3cff6bf876.png.webp" alt="Map showing US Navy vessels deployed in the Middle East, covering the eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Arabian Sea, with Iran highlighted.

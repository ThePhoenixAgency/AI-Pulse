To have him as a headliner of the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show feels like the culmination of a deep, long-term partnership that spans most of the last decade, at a time period in which he’s forever changed global pop music.” The global superstar recently shared the record-breaking first-look trailer shot in Puerto Rico in the lead-up to the highly anticipated Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show on Sunday, February 8, at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Ahead of the game, Apple Music subscribers can check out the ultimate Bad Bunny Essentials; listen to the mood playlists Dance Bunny, Trap Bunny, Sad Bunny, Party Bunny, and Bunny &amp; Friends, which showcase the many sides of Bad Bunny; explore The DNA of DtMF playlist that highlights Puerto Rican styles and sounds handpicked by the artist; stream an exclusive career-spanning 2026 Super Bowl LX Megamix (DJ Mix) from Bad Bunny’s biggest producer, Tainy; discover new NFL player playlists; and more.

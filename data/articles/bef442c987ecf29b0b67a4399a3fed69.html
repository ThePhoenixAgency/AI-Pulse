</header> <div> <p>Michigan is taking on major oil and gas companies in court, joining nearly a dozen other states that have brought climate-related lawsuits against ExxonMobil and its industry peers. But Michigan’s approach is different: accusing Big Oil not of deceiving consumers or misrepresenting climate change risks, but of driving up energy costs by colluding to suppress competition from cleaner and cheaper technologies like solar power and electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The strategy is risky and might run into challenges, but it could potentially be a game changer if the state can overcome initial dismissal attempts by the industry defendants, legal experts say.</p>
<p>Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed the lawsuit last month in federal District Court against BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell and the American Petroleum Institute. The <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/ag/-/media/Project/Websites/AG/releases/2026/January/Michigan-Energy-Affordability-Complaint.pdf?rev=5fe0d3cf29174f30a7f4853ef1eb0c22&amp;hash=3242B297D226DCDD835DF7D328490E32">suit</a>, brought under federal and state antitrust laws, alleges a conspiracy to delay the transition to renewable energy and EVs and maintain market dominance of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Exxon said in a statement that the state’s action is “yet another legally incoherent effort to regulate by lawsuit. It won’t reduce emissions, it won’t help consumers, and it won’t stand up to the law.”</p>
<p>Chevron did not respond to a request for comment, and BP and Shell declined to comment.</p>
<p>API senior vice president and general counsel Ryan Meyers said that Michigan’s case is “baseless” and “part of a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions.”</p>
<p>“We continue to believe that energy policy belongs in Congress, not a patchwork of courtrooms,” Meyers added.</p>
<p>This week during a congressional hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi testifying, U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) referenced Michigan’s lawsuit in arguing that these “novel approaches” to “climate lawfare” require a federal response. Hageman <a href="https://x.com/powerthefuture/status/2021695927514173467">said</a> she is working with House and Senate colleagues to craft legislation aimed at shielding fossil fuel companies from state climate liability laws and lawsuits.</p> </div> <div> <p>API has been lobbying Congress on exactly this kind of liability shield. The organization has recently lobbied on “draft legislation related to state efforts to impose liability on the oil and gas industry,” according to its lobbying reports. And API is now <a href="https://www.api.org/news-policy-and-issues/energy-agenda">stating publicly</a> that stopping “extreme climate liability policy” such as lawsuits and state climate superfund laws is one of its top priorities for 2026.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, Michigan argues that the oil companies and their chief trade association operated as a cartel, working to hinder the development of alternatives in the primary energy and transportation markets in order to keep consumers dependent upon oil and gas. This anticompetitive conduct, the state says, has resulted in fewer choices for consumers when it comes to fueling their cars or heating their homes, and has left consumers paying more for energy than they otherwise would have.</p>
<p>The lawsuit comes at a time of mounting concerns over affordability and the cost of living, including rising energy costs. Nessel <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/ag/news/press-releases/2026/01/23/attorney-general-nessel-files-lawsuit-against-fossil-fuel-defendants">said</a> these “out-of-control costs” are largely “due to the greed of these corporations who prioritized their own profit and marketplace dominance over competition and consumer savings.”</p>
<p>According to the state’s complaint, clean energy technologies would have reached scale much sooner, and consumers would have avoided billions of dollars in overcharges, were it not for the defendants’ deliberate actions to forestall their development and deployment.</p>
<p>“Defendants have dramatically delayed the availability of EVs, made 100 percent clean charging stations a rarity, suppressed the advancement of solar technology and its uptake by consumers, and prolonged fossil fuels’ dominance in mixed-source electricity generation,” the complaint argues.</p>
<p>The lawsuit details allegations of coordinated anticompetitive conduct, such as abandoning research and investments in alternative energy technologies and using patent litigation to stifle innovation. Exxon, which invented an early version of the lithium-ion battery, halted its EV battery research program in the early 1980s, while Chevron worked to block commercialization of a nickel-metal hydride battery technology.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oil companies were also early developers of the solar energy market and controlled much of the sector in the 1980s. But then they abandoned these ventures and, according to the complaint, “used litigation to deter new market entrants.” As attorney Tracy Emblem wrote in a <a href="https://www.laprogressive.com/climate-change/big-oil-controlled-photovoltaic-industry">2010 article</a>, big oil companies “seized and took control of the research and patents” for PV solar in order to thwart its development.</p>
<p>Oil companies understood the threat posed to their business by a large-scale transition away from fossil fuels, the Michigan lawsuit says, and therefore they worked together to try to block alternatives from taking off and to ultimately delay the transition.</p>
<p>The complaint cites a <a href="https://www.climatefiles.com/exxonmobil/1979-exxon-memo-on-potential-impact-of-fossil-fuel-combustion/">1979 internal study</a> by Exxon finding that alternatives to fossil fuels would need to account for at least half of global energy supply by 2010 in order to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. That same year, API established a CO2 and Climate Task Force, and through this task force the defendants “reached a consensus to restrain innovation and coordinate efforts to delay the inevitable energy transition,” the complaint alleges.</p>
<p>Proving there was an actual conspiracy or an agreement among the companies, however, is likely to be one of the biggest challenges for the state, legal experts say.</p>
<p>“In establishing an antitrust claim, essentially a conspiracy, you need to prove an agreement,” Gary Mouw, partner at the Michigan-based law firm Varnum LLP, told Inside Climate News. “You need to allege sufficient facts, specific concrete facts where it can be concluded or interpreted that these parties actually entered into an agreement to coordinate.”</p>
<p>He said he expects the defendants will argue that the allegations lack specificity and that there was no established consensus to collude.</p> </div> </article> <div> <header> </header> <ol> <li> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/verizon-makes-customers-wait-35-days-to-unlock-fully-paid-off-phones/"> <img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/verizon-jerks-locked-phone-768x432-1765486981.jpg" alt="Listing image for first story in Most Read: Verizon imposes new roadblock on users trying to unlock paid-off phones"> </a> </li> <li> </li> <li> </li> <li> </li> <li> </li> </ol>

<p>The Best Buy Presidents' Day appliances sale is always one of the main draws of the holiday from a shopping perspective, as that's one of the few times of the year when the retailer offers its biggest discounts. That's the case again for 2026, with savings of up to 40% up for grabs on refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers, dryers, ovens, and more.</p><p><strong></strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/all-appliances-on-sale/major-appliances-on-sale/pcmcat1637009256299.c?id=pcmcat1637009256299"><strong>Browse the full Best Buy Presidents' Day appliances sale</strong></a></p>

<p>I'd usually consider the world of smart home tech if you're searching for a little Presidents' Day sales bargain as a treat for yourself. And, as luck would have it, there's a decent sale on Blink devices over at Amazon.</p><p>The offer that stands out the most to me as a solid saving on a useful product is this Blink Mini 2 for $23.99. It's a small and handy home security camera that's easy to set up and put around the house if you want to monitor a room or maybe a pet while you're away from home.</p><p><strong>Blink Mini 2: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-2-Camera-White/dp/B0BWWZXWPL?th=1">was $39.99 now <strong>$23.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p>

<p>Hmm, if there's one deal above all the rest that I think you need to check out today, I would have to go with this <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/lg-48-class-b5-series-oled-ai-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2025/JJ8VPZTK9F">massive $700 saving on the LG B5 48-inch OLED TV at Best Buy</a>.</p><p>Not exactly an impulse purchase, sure, but this is a fantastic price for what we think is one of the best budget OLED TVs you can buy. It's great for all-around viewing, and even excels as a gaming TV thanks to the inclusion of HDMI 2.1 ports, which get you the fastest and smoothest experience on PS5 and Xbox Series X.</p>

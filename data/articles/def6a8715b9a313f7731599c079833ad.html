<article> <div>We marked milestone anniversaries across services, including Apple Podcasts, Music, News, and more — each made possible by the artists, creators, journalists, and storytellers who bring these platforms to life. And we brought services to more users across the globe than ever before, with Apple Pay now available in 89 markets, Find My launching in South Korea, and Apple Fitness+ expanding to 28 additional countries and regions.
</div> <figure> </figure> <figure> </figure> <div><strong>Apple TV</strong>’s engagement this past December soared, with total hours viewed up 36 percent compared to the previous year, setting a new record for monthly engagement. This milestone was fueled by robust audience growth across Europe and Latin America, continued expansion in the U.S., and the global streaming debuts of&nbsp;<em>F1</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pluribus</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Family Plan 2</em>, as well as the timeless Peanuts classic&nbsp;<em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>.&nbsp;The landmark year was propelled by Apple’s summer blockbuster&nbsp;<em>F1</em>&nbsp;— the No. 1 movie at the global box office, the top film on Apple TV, and the highest-grossing sports movie of all time — as well as the premiere of Apple TV’s biggest series to date, the widely acclaimed <em>Pluribus.</em>

According to Apple data, as well as industry data, over the past year, Apple Pay has eliminated well over $1 billion in fraud globally, as well as generated more than $100 billion in incremental merchant sales globally. And during the peak holiday shopping weekend, purchases made through Apple Pay significantly outpaced the overall growth in consumer spending levels during that time period. With iOS 26, Apple Pay allows banks and lenders to enable users to pay with bank- or lender-provided installments and rewards in stores.

With iOS 26, Maps became more personalized and intelligent, with new features like Preferred Routes, which uses on-device intelligence for daily commutes, and Visited Places, which helps users recall past locations.

To make Fitness+ even more welcoming, the service introduced digitally dubbed workouts and meditations in Spanish and German, featuring a generated voice based on the actual voice of each of the 28 Fitness+ trainers. Today, the service offers more than 8,000 workouts and meditations in 4K Ultra HD. Fitness+ also launched powerful personalization features with ready-made Custom Plans, and users with AirPods Pro 3 can now view real-time performance metrics directly onscreen for extra motivation.<sup>4</sup>

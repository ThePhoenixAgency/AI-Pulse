The derivatives market, too, is showing signs of positivity.</p><p>The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) is little changed, up just 0.7% in the period.</p><div><p><span>STORY CONTINUES BELOW</span></p></div><p>While the gains mark a recovery from yesterday's U.S. trading, which saw the cryptocurrency market fall back toward last week's lows, bitcoin is still on track for a fourth straight week of declines. That's the longest falling streak since mid-November.</p><p>Meantime, a slowdown in trading and fading volatility are weighing on volumes.</p><p>It's likely that traders are looking to the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) print coming later today for hints on direction. A higher-than-forecast reading could lift bond yields and the dollar, putting additional pressure on risk assets. A lower reading might signal the easier conditions that are more conducive to risk-taking.</p><p>Even so, it will take quite a jump to push the bitcoin price to $85,000, a level that Deribiti's chief commercial officer, Jean-David Péquignot, said would signal the largest cryptocurrency's long-term <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/13/bitcoin-s-long-term-rally-is-broken-until-it-reclaims-usd85-000-deribit-executive-says">rally is no longer "broken."</a></p><h2>Derivatives </h2><ul><li>The market is showing signs of renewed life as open interest (OI) dropped to $15.5 billion, suggesting a cleanup of late-cycle leverage. </li><li>Perpetual funding rates have flipped neutral to positive across all venues, now ranging between 0% and 8%. This broader optimism is being mirrored by institutions, as the three-month annualized basis spiked to just over 3%, signaling the first real uptick in professional conviction.</li><li>The bitcoin options market shows returning call volume at 65%, even as the one-week 25-delta skew eased to 17.9%. Despite this "bottom-fishing" activity, the implied volatility (IV) term structure remains in short-term backwardation, confirming that traders are still paying a high "panic premium" for immediate downside protection.</li><li>Coinglass data shows $256 million in 24-hour liquidations, split 69-31 between longs and shorts. Bitcoin ($112 million), ether ($52 million) and others ($16 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations.</li><li>The Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $68,800 as a core liquidation level to monitor in case of a price rise.</li></ul><h2>Token Talk</h2><ul><li>PUMP, the token of Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun, is up more than 5% in the past 24 hours.</li><li>The platform <a href="https://medium.com/@pumpdotfun_/pump-fun-github-creator-fee-claiming-guide-d6f04af1acf6" target="_blank">rolled out</a> a new way for token communities to allocate fees directly through its mobile app with the inclusion of GitHub account integration.</li><li>The integration offers a simpler way for creators to assign automatic payouts generated by a token's community, and more social features are expected to be introduced in the future.</li><li>In practice, this means communities can start supporting creators on GitHub through a portion of the fees generated. To receive the fees, creators will need to claim them through the platform’s mobile app.</li><li>Pump.fun was largely behind a major memecoin trading frenzy early last year that saw its monthly trading volume surge past $11 billion. Volume has since plunged to $1 billion last month, according to DeFiLlama <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/pump.fun?dexVolume=true&amp;groupBy=monthly" target="_blank">data</a>. </li></ul></div><div><p>More For You</p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>Trump-linked Truth Social seeks SEC approval for two crypto ETFs </p><div><p>14 hours ago</p></div><figure><img alt="(Alex Wong/Getty Images)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F6a274a4a92ce9bfd254f3fd35114c253a1e4f438-4380x2920.jpg%3Frect%3D0%2C0%2C4380%2C2464%26w%3D1920%26h%3D1080%26auto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" /></figure><p>The filings include a bitcoin and ether ETF and a staking-focused Cronos fund, deepening the Truth Social brand’s ambitions in digital asset investing.</p><div><p>What to know: </p><div><ul><li>Yorkville America Equities, the firm behind Truth Social–branded ETFs, has filed with the SEC to launch a Truth Social Bitcoin and Ether ETF and a Truth Social Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF.</li><li>The proposed Cronos-focused ETF would invest in and stake Cronos (CRO) tokens, aiming to generate yield through staking rewards in addition to price exposure.</li><li>If approved, the funds would be launched in partnership with Crypto.com, which would provide custody, liquidity and staking services, and be distributed through its affiliate Foris Capital US LLC.</li></ul></div></div><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/13/trump-linked-truth-social-seeks-sec-approval-for-two-crypto-etfs">Read full story</a></p></div></div><div><p>Top Stories</p></div></div></div>

    <div><div><p>Only one in ten Gen Zers have had children at 23 compared with almost one in four millennials at a similar age, a study has revealed.</p><p>Researchers from the UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies analysed data from almost 10,000 people taking part in the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS).</p><p>The MCS, considered to be a gold standard in social research, follows the lives of about 19,000 young people across the UK classified as Gen Z, who were born between 2000 and 2002. The researchers found that only 10 per cent of this group had become parents by the age of 23.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/society/article/the-nations-birthrate-has-plummeted-how-did-we-get-here-30qtqddwn?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdoCAXG5xIv6fwYeIhtvZe2zWVSecfeqw4MGyYcNJHa3Q6mwFD8eghWuDlWCbg%3D&amp;gaa_ts=699b2e65&amp;gaa_sig=U_mf-B6gkAJChFToKl0lXPTctavvcSE-OwhU4eEMAvyOow2kNXfqsMD7GrDDtO5U5fMnFfX-ZfF4oVBQfRwtHA%3D%3D"><b>The nation’s birthrate has plummeted. How did we get here?</b></a></p><p>In comparison, data from a separate longitudinal study at UCL called “Next Steps”, following<span> the lives of 16,000 millennials born in 1989-90, showed that 24 per cent of this previous generation had become parents by the age of 25.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p>The findings reflect an established trend of a <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/deaths-outnumber-births-uk-tgzsrnsnl?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdndpRFrjFvGGfexy5xWaNMvV9YKfMi1LzuWiTYdOlUeptcwOfgSYiuC5MrIfI%3D&amp;gaa_ts=699b298b&amp;gaa_sig=qTJUV2qVjQ4xnNLLezd8LgYNOuwXz0y87gRrgpypFdvXaqcntQf3T37q_97mfoyeuE0ydVafy_Ub4E9n4w-M2g%3D%3D">falling birthrate in the UK</a> and across the world and a rise in the age of people becoming parents.</p><p>Last August, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the fertility rate in England and Wales had fallen for the third year in a row. The total fertility rate dropped to <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/fertility-rate-england-wales-figures-xlwst8g8p?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcz8t2yuiKyfy_Hi8D38RxbS1jBOyHWkmDuh2uwyN9dCwKGyVWZgPzFwjFJyU0%3D&amp;gaa_ts=699b29d1&amp;gaa_sig=WCUDxOFVnr7a52a23BDUSgtEPCvqdMgjv4YabWbzqpVLIarIeJ5agw2sCD3IzAmkJJq1Bdny02FVCVVKsdQB5Q%3D%3D">1.41 children per woman</a> — the lowest since comparable figures were first collected in 1938.</p><p>Overall, the average age for new mothers in England and Wales rose from 29 to 31 between 2004 and 2024. For fathers it went up from 32 to 33.9. However, despite the significant decrease in younger people having children, the vast majority of Gen Z still expressed a strong desire to become parents in the future. Some 61 per cent said they would definitely like to have children or have more offspring if they were already parents.</p><p>The MCS also found that more than two thirds of Gen Z, or 68 per cent, were living with their parents at the age of 23. This number is three times the proportion of millennials who were living at home at a comparative age a decade earlier.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/britain-babies-birth-rate-immigration-sdllq0hps?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqd-8GBK-c5JinG7KKe3z9Z2jsnjVudOpEtks3mRxZC0saCKP49U03qEtFLOiH8%3D&amp;gaa_ts=699b2e65&amp;gaa_sig=Lj5u50JLT-CsI-HjQc30Fi5S6OL8v_MHwwKDakggftvSfq3VD3M-mxB2stLtkzm1xqqhMtEDRfdEBENUsT6nEA%3D%3D"><b>Sebastian Payne: Britain needs babies but it will take some pushing</b></a></p><p>More than a fifth of the Gen Z group said they were living in rental accommodation, while only 1 in 20 owned their home and the same proportion lived in other accommodation such as university halls of residence.</p><p>Just under a quarter said they had not yet left home because they could not afford to move out and almost a fifth said they were living with parents to save for a deposit. One in eight reported that they did not feel ready to leave the family home.</p><p>When it came to romantic relationships, 54 per cent of Gen Z had a partner at the age of 23 and 17 per cent lived with their other half. Among the millennials who took part in UCL’s Next Steps study, a much lower proportion — 23 per cent — lived with their parents at the age of 25. Thirty-nine per cent lived in rented accommodation and 17 per cent owned their own home. In addition, 40 per cent lived with their partner.</p><p>The MCS’s lead author, Charlotte Booth, said the findings suggested Gen Zers were delaying adult milestones compared with previous generations. She said this was “partly due to challenging economic conditions and the high cost of living, making it unaffordable for young people to move out”.</p><p>• <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/parenting/article/parenting-gen-z-worry-about-adult-kids-qmj5xpcwn?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqd5sItXLKOA7-c9M52tvTag2Vo1EOqbUPV98LAlvVpXnFvvBfMEzUIvE8yEYjA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=699b2e16&amp;gaa_sig=5fA9LJ-fvMDbmgRlMMe4Axm-A_tkuL3lsk8Nb0W5u99VVDwsWCTxcfoqPhVtzA15WSwNrXeJPyaavqYmprq7fA%3D%3D"><b>Parenting Gen Z: why I still worry about my adult kids</b></a></p><p>“These financial challenges may lead to a cascade of problems in the future, including lower birth rates and higher rates of mental health problems,” Booth warned. “Policymakers should consider helping young people to gain independence and have the opportunity to start families of their own through policies that support them to find affordable homes and good jobs.</p><p>“With pressing concerns about a declining workforce and ageing population across society, helping Gen Z to reach adult milestones is likely to improve this generation’s mental health and help to increase future economic growth and stability in the UK.”</p><p></p></div></div>

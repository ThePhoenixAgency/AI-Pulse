<p><strong>Raspberry Pi has announced further price hikes for its single-board computers, increasing the cost of its some models by as much as $60.</strong></p>



<p>The latest increases are on top of the those it announced late last year for certain memory capacity models of its Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 SBCs.</p>



<p>Why the rise? It’s not to goose any bottom lines but what <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/more-memory-driven-price-rises/" target="_blank">the company describes</a> as an <em>“unprecedented rise in the cost of LPDDR4 memory, thanks to competition for memory fab capacity from the AI infrastructure roll-out”</em>.</p>



<p><em>“The cost of some parts has more than doubled over the last quarter. As a result, we now need to make further<strong> increases to our own pricing, affecting all Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, and Compute Module 4 and 5, products </strong>that have 2GB or more of memory.”</em></p>



<p>As well as the models mentioned above, the Raspberry Pi 500 and the 500+ see prices rises in line with the rest. </p>



<p>For consumers, tech tinkerers and industrial needs, this means less bang for your buck. Here’s a glance at how the cost of the Raspberry Pi 5 fares with the latest increase: </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Raspberry Pi 5</strong></th><th><strong>Price increase</strong></th><th>RRP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1GB</td><td>–</td><td>$45</td></tr><tr><td>2GB</td><td>$10</td><td>$65</td></tr><tr><td>4GB</td><td>$15</td><td>$85</td></tr><tr><td>8GB</td><td>$30</td><td>$125</td></tr><tr><td>16GB</td><td>$60</td><td>$205</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>For reference, the <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2025/01/raspberry-pi-5-16gb-ram-announced">Raspberry Pi 5 16GB</a> launched in 2025 an RRP of $120 – which many found pricey at the time. </p>



<h2>Other models unchanged </h2>



<p>On a brighter note, <strong>the Raspberry Pi 400 is sticking at $60</strong>, and Raspberry Pi models with 1GB RAM, such as the $35 Raspberry Pi 4 and the $45 Raspberry Pi 5, do not see price increases.</p>



<p>Pricing of the Pi Zero, Pi 3 and older products is similarly unaffected, as the company has ample inventory of the LPDDR2 RAM chips they use. </p>



<p>As painful as price rises are in general, for ostensibly low-cost “maker” platforms like the Pi they sting more. </p>



<p>Few people buy a Pi to use as their main PC (cheaper options exist for those folks), but those working on IoT, embedded or robotics projects, or tackle hobby projects, the Pi is the more versatile, adaptable and, usually, affordable option.</p>



<h3>More price rises to come?</h3>



<p>AI is <em>Absolutely Insatiable</em> in its demand for compute – demand that’s forecast to increase in 2026 and maintain volatile memory pricing. </p>



<p>Raspberry Pi is optimistic, describing the current situation as<em> “ultimately a temporary one”,</em> and expects to lower prices as soon as the demand and competition for manufacturing and parts lets up.</p>



<p>There’s a lot to deride about the “AI” gold-rush, but driving up the cost of Pis, phones and mini-PCs is the most unforgivable – all so more people can <em>“make aunty jean look like an anthropomorphic turnip”</em> in an effort to bolster civilisationmaxxing. </p>

Android 17 Beta arrives with quiet but meaningful changes, hinting at a smarter release cycle and subtle polish ahead. Usama Jawad Neowin @UsamaJawad96 · Feb 14, 2026 03:22 EST Android 16 has been out for over eight months, and while many devices are yet to receive the update, Google has now begun seeding the first beta release of Android 17. It contains lots of under-the-hood improvements for developers, along with UX enhancements for consumers. But before we get into the nitty-gritty details of the update, it's better to understand the current release cycle of Android versions. As announced last year, Google has replaced the Developer Preview program with a Canary channel that brings continuous over-the-air (OTA) updates to those who want to stay on the bleeding edge. This channel offers faster access to new features, better stability for beta releases, and easier testing since manual flashing of images is no longer required. Beginning with this first beta release in February, Google is targeting the Platform Stability milestone sometime in March. For those unaware, this is the point at which the company finalizes APIs and app-facing behaviors. Developers then have several months to adjust their apps before general availability. Android 17 is scheduled to get quarterly releases, but this upcoming 26Q2 release is the only one planned to have breaking changes for apps. This is because Android 17 (API level 37) removes the developer opt-out for orientation and resizability restrictions on large screen devices, which means that developers must adjust their apps now to work on all form factors, regardless of screen size and orientation. There are tons of other backend enhancements too, summarized below: Lock-free MessageQueue Generational garbage collection Static final fields now truly final Custom Notification View Restrictions New performance debugging ProfilingManager triggers Dynamic Camera Session Updates Logical multi-camera device metadata Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Support Deprecation of Cleartext Traffic Attribute HPKE Hybrid Cryptography Enhanced VoIP Call History Wi-Fi Ranging and Proximity Improved distinction between medical and fitness companion apps Exemptions and User Control for app behavior based on aspect ratio Configuration changes‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​​ Of course, this is only a high-level summary, so if you're an Android developer, make sure to check out the changes here. In terms of consumer-facing enhancements available in Android 17 Beta 1, 9to5Google has spotted cosmetic changes to the Search widget, an updated brightness icon, a slightly darker location indicator, the availability of the Gemini screen shrink animation now available from the corner swipe, more compact settings menu, a new volume overflow icon, and confirmation that the dessert-themed internal codename of this Android version is indeed "Cinnamon Bun". If you want to download this beta over-the-air, you'll have to join the associated program through an eligible Pixel device here. Shortly after that, you'll see the update on your Android device when you check for updates.</code></pre>

It said more than 53,845 people had been arrested.</p><p>The Iranian opposition remains divided and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel and making a highly publicised visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps. He has also never distanced himself from his father’s autocratic rule.</p><p><em>Agence France-Presse contributed to this report</em></p></div></div>

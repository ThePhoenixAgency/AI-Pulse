People who have no links to terrorism and are almost certainly suffering as a result of terrorist acts should not be treated as though they are terrorists themselves.</p> <p>To apply indiscriminate bans in this way would be little more than blind prejudice, prejudging people based on where they are from rather than who they are. The opposition cannot maintain that it is promoting Australian values and then promote a policy which denies the most basic level of fairness to innocent people with a valid and lawful reason for wishing to visit Australia, including family members of Australian citizens and residents.</p>

I don’t know where it’s come from, and I don’t know what’s in it.</p>
</blockquote><p>Taylor said that the plan he would announce would be developed with his soon-to-be-announced shadow cabinet, but would not be drawn on detail beyond the principles he had outlined in his speech after becoming Liberal leader on Friday.</p><p>In response to being asked on whether social media would be checked, Taylor said intelligence agencies “need to be looking at this very very closely”, and there would be some regions migrants are coming from “where the risks are high”.</p><blockquote> <p>That doesn’t mean you necessarily shut the door on those places, but it does mean you do the work to make sure the people who are coming are not people who are going to threaten our way of life, and bring violence to our country.</p>

Racism is pervasive across the sector, affecting many groups in serious ways … The attack on Camp Sovereignty, the antisemitic terror attack in Bondi and the recent alleged attempted bombing targeting First Peoples on 26 January in Perth – these are the horrifying outcomes when racism in our society isn’t addressed.</p>
</blockquote><p>The report made 47 recommendations for the federal government and universities, including a national framework for anti-racism in tertiary education, better accountability and a more diverse leadership and workforce.</p><p>Only 11 universities were found to have advanced, standalone anti‐racism strategies.</p><p>Sivaraman said the report showed the “critical importance” of the federal government endorsing and funding key recommendations of the <a href="https://humanrights.gov.au/__data/assets/file/0021/47334/NARF_Full_Report_FINAL_DIGITAL_ACCESSIBLE.pdf">National Anti-Racism Framework</a>, which the commission delivered in November 2024.</p><blockquote> <p>We cannot wait any longer as racism continues to impact the lives of many in visceral ways.</p>

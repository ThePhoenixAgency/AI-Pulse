  <h1>Still struggling with iOS 26 battery life? iOS 27 could fix it soon – but here are 7 ways to boost it now</h1>
  <figcaption><span>(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Don’t want to wait until iOS 27 arrives in the summer? There are still plenty of things you can do that will improve your iPhone’s battery life right now. On its website, for example, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X363&amp;xcust=trd_us_1012771506188295373&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fbatteries%2Fmaximizing-performance%2F%23iosdevicestips&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fphones%2Fstill-struggling-with-ios-26-battery-life-ios-27-could-fix-it-soon-but-here-are-7-ways-to-boost-it-now" target="_blank">Apple advises</a> you to update your iPhone to the latest operating system, as this might contain battery and performance tweaks that can help your device last longer on a single charge.</p><p>Other than that, you can enable <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/heres-how-i-optimize-my-iphones-battery-life-to-make-it-last-longer">Low Power Mode</a>, which disables several features that are known to quickly drain your battery life. Or you can enable the similar <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/ive-been-using-ios-26-for-months-here-are-the-5-things-you-should-try-first">Adaptive Power Mode</a> if you’re running iOS 26, and this automatically adjusts iOS features based on your usage patterns with the goal of slowing battery drain. You can enable both Low Power Mode and Adaptive Power Mode in <strong>Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Power Mode</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/tired-of-seeing-low-battery-pop-up-on-iphone-here-are-5-simple-display-settings-to-improve-your-battery-life">Dimming your brightness</a> – or enabling Auto-Brightness, which adjusts your screen brightness on the fly, under <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; Auto-Brightness</strong> – will help to reduce the amount of power consumed by your display. Another screen tip is to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/ive-been-using-iphones-for-years-and-i-always-turn-off-this-major-ios-feature">disable the iPhone’s always-on display</a> (if your iPhone is compatible) by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Always On Display</strong>.</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><p>Wi-Fi connections also typically use less power than cellular data, so enabling Wi-Fi is also a good idea. You can do that in Settings &gt; Wi-Fi.</p><p>Finally, be sure to examine all the data displayed under Settings &gt; Battery. Here, you’ll find detailed reports on how quickly your battery is dropping and what the main culprits are when it comes to battery drain. Make adjustments based on that information and you might be able to eke out even more juice from your battery while you wait for iOS 27 to touch down.</p><hr /><p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

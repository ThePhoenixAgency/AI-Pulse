<hr /><ul><li><strong>iOS 27 could help prolong your battery life, a new report claims</strong></li><li><strong>The changes should come to iPhones new and old</strong></li><li><strong>There are ways you can improve your battery life before iOS 27 arrives</strong></li></ul><hr /><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> will likely show off <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/ios/the-5-biggest-rumored-upgrades-coming-to-your-iphone-in-ios-27-including-the-long-awaited-new-siri">iOS 27</a> at WWDC 2026 in June, but details have already started emerging about what it could deliver. While it’s expected to be a much smaller update than <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/sorry-apple-but-i-dont-think-ios-26-is-fit-for-purpose">iOS 26</a>, a new report says it’ll contain vital battery life improvements that could help your iPhone last longer, even if it’s an older model.</p><p>This rumor comes from the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27" target="_blank">Power On newsletter</a> published this past weekend by Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman. There, Gurman describes iOS 27 as a “cleanup job” whose code changes “could improve battery life” for the company’s <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-iphone">best iPhones</a>. These changes should affect any device that’s compatible with iOS 27, including older phones.</p><p>Gurman says that right now, iOS code is “a bit of a mess under the hood.” That has led to various inefficiencies that can lead to sluggish battery performance. But with iOS 27 aiming to nix these once and for all – including by “removing scraps of old code, rewriting features and subtly upgrading apps to let them perform better” – the result could be a “snappier, more responsive <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/operating-system">operating system</a>.”</p><p>We don’t know how much of an improvement we’re likely to see, and Gurman notes that “it’s unclear if [Apple] will market the changes – or if this is just a benefit of cleaning things up.” If Apple decides against promoting the battery increase, that could imply that the difference will be relatively minor – but many iPhone owners will be hoping for more, given their <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/still-having-ios-26-battery-life-problems-try-these-5-fixes-to-improve-it">struggles with iOS 26</a>.</p><h2>How to improve your iPhone’s battery life</h2><figure><div><p>

</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Don’t want to wait until iOS 27 arrives in the summer? There are still plenty of things you can do that will improve your iPhone’s battery life right now. On its website, for example, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X363&amp;xcust=trd_us_1012771506188295373&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fbatteries%2Fmaximizing-performance%2F%23iosdevicestips&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fphones%2Fstill-struggling-with-ios-26-battery-life-ios-27-could-fix-it-soon-but-here-are-7-ways-to-boost-it-now" target="_blank">Apple advises</a> you to update your iPhone to the latest operating system, as this might contain battery and performance tweaks that can help your device last longer on a single charge.</p><p>Other than that, you can enable <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/heres-how-i-optimize-my-iphones-battery-life-to-make-it-last-longer">Low Power Mode</a>, which disables several features that are known to quickly drain your battery life. Or you can enable the similar <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/ive-been-using-ios-26-for-months-here-are-the-5-things-you-should-try-first">Adaptive Power Mode</a> if you’re running iOS 26, and this automatically adjusts iOS features based on your usage patterns with the goal of slowing battery drain. You can enable both Low Power Mode and Adaptive Power Mode in <strong>Settings &gt; Battery &gt; Power Mode</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/tired-of-seeing-low-battery-pop-up-on-iphone-here-are-5-simple-display-settings-to-improve-your-battery-life">Dimming your brightness</a> – or enabling Auto-Brightness, which adjusts your screen brightness on the fly, under <strong>Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &amp; Text Size &gt; Auto-Brightness</strong> – will help to reduce the amount of power consumed by your display. Another screen tip is to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/ive-been-using-iphones-for-years-and-i-always-turn-off-this-major-ios-feature">disable the iPhone’s always-on display</a> (if your iPhone is compatible) by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Always On Display</strong>.</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><p>Wi-Fi connections also typically use less power than cellular data, so enabling Wi-Fi is also a good idea. You can do that in Settings &gt; Wi-Fi.</p><p>Finally, be sure to examine all the data displayed under Settings &gt; Battery. Here, you’ll find detailed reports on how quickly your battery is dropping and what the main culprits are when it comes to battery drain. Make adjustments based on that information and you might be able to eke out even more juice from your battery while you wait for iOS 27 to touch down.</p><hr /><p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>Eleven suspects, including a parliamentary aide to France’s hard-left party, have been arrested in connection with the killing last week of a far-right activist in an incident that has shocked the country and laid bare its deep political divisions.</p><p>Quentin Deranque, 23, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/16/french-police-murder-inquiry-quentin-deranque-lyon">died on Saturday</a> after sustaining a severe brain injury. The Lyon prosecutor, Thierry Dran, said he had been “thrown to the ground and beaten by at least six individuals” during an incident last week.</p><p>The attack took place as Deranque, a mathematics student, was on the sidelines of a protest against a university conference attended by Rima Hassan, a European member of parliament for Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s leftwing party, La France Insoumise (LFI).</p><p>The anti-immigration <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/m-le-mag/article/2026/02/18/nemesis-the-identitarian-activists-behind-feminist-masks_6750599_117.html">Némésis collective</a>, which was protesting against the conference, said at the weekend that Deranque had been there to protect its members and was assaulted by anti-fascist activists. Hassan and other members of LFI have condemned the killing.</p><figure><div><img alt="Someone holding up a sign that says ‘Justice Pour Quentin’" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/398ed8db242415051d92711d27c2f86f4ca0b5b5/0_0_4492_3000/master/4492.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Rallies in support of Quentin Deranque have taken place since he was killed.</span> Photograph: Arnaud Cesar Vilette/SIPA/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>The incident has inflamed political tensions in France in the run-up to next month’s municipal elections as well as the 2027 presidential race, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/11/marine-le-pen-appeal-trial-ends-with-presidential-race-at-stake">in which polls suggest</a> the far-right National Rally (RN) could achieve its best result to date.</p><p>The first wave of arrests was announced late on Tuesday, as Dran said nine suspects had been arrested. Those detained included people who were suspected of having participated in the violence and others who had provided support to them, sources told Agence France-Presse.</p><p>Hours later, two more suspects were arrested: a man who the prosecutor said was suspected of being directly linked to the violence as well as his partner, who was suspected of trying to help him evade justice.</p><p>The LFI politician Raphaël Arnault confirmed that his parliamentary assistant was among those detained, adding the aide had “ceased all parliamentary work”.</p><p>On Wednesday, as news of the arrests spread, the LFI said it had been forced to evacuate its national headquarters. “The national headquarters of LFI have just been evacuated following a bomb threat,” the party’s coordinator, Manuel Bompard, said on social media. “Police services are on site. All employees and activists are safe.”</p><figure><div><img alt="Manuel Bompard talks to the press outside the party’s headquarters" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8133a217ab272e676f2ea8e19b37530e73117d5e/0_0_5242_3495/master/5242.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Manuel Bompard talks to the press outside the party’s headquarters after its evacuation.</span> Photograph: Charlotte Siemon/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>As videos of last week’s deadly confrontation continued to circulate on social media, Mélenchon called for calm. “Let’s not fuel the incitement to take the law into one’s own hands,” the LFI leader said on social media.</p><p>Images broadcast by TF1 of the alleged attack showed several people hitting three others who were lying on the ground, two of whom managed to escape. One witness told AFP: “People were hitting each other with iron bars.”</p><p>Némésis, the anti-immigration collective linked to Deranque, has blamed the killing on La Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist youth group co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament. La Jeune Garde – which was dissolved in June – has denied any links to the “tragic events” and Arnault has called the killing “horrific”.</p><figure></figure><p>While the government has singled out LFI and La Jeune Garde, the Lyon prosecutor on Monday declined to comment on those claims, instead telling reporters that the investigation was looking into suspected “intentional homicide” and aggravated assault.</p><p>Politicians held a minute of silence on Tuesday afternoon at France’s national assembly in memory of Deranque, while a march is expected to be held in Lyon next Saturday in his honour.</p><p>In a post this weekend, the French president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a>, addressed the incident and called for calm. “It is essential that the perpetrators of this ignominy be prosecuted, brought to justice and convicted. Hatred that kills has no place among us,” he wrote on social media. “I call for calm, restraint and respect.”</p><p><em>Agence France-Presse contributed to this report</em></p></div></div>

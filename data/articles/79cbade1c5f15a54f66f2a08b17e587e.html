    <div><div><p>Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series processors in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-mac-os/777936/apple-macos-tahoe-26-final-release-testing-impressions-liquid-glass">newest operating system, macOS 26</a>. Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024 and hasn’t stopped.</p><p>These days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800, although the quality of deals fluctuates frequently. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac&amp;subid1=vergedeals030724">Apple’s refurbished store</a> offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent.</p><p>But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.</p><div><div><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0049.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0049.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FWD5MR3L/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-14-in-lifestyle-work-251015.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=21.875%2C0%2C56.25%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FWD5MR3L/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-14-in-lifestyle-work-251015.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-pro-16-inch-apple-m4-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-24gb-memory-512gb-ssd-space-black%2F6602755.p" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/hermano/verge/product/image/10336/247412_Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_M4_Pro_OGrove_0005.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-pro-16-inch-apple-m4-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-24gb-memory-512gb-ssd-space-black%2F6602755.p" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/hermano/verge/product/image/10336/247412_Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_M4_Pro_OGrove_0005.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1859258-REG%2Fapple_mu9d3ll_a_mac_mini_m4_10c_10cgpu_16gb_256gb.html" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/hermano/verge/product/image/10324/DSC_1216.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1859258-REG%2Fapple_mu9d3ll_a_mac_mini_m4_10c_10cgpu_16gb_256gb.html" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/hermano/verge/product/image/10324/DSC_1216.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>The best MacBook Air deals</h2><p></p></div><div><p></p><h3>M4 MacBook Air</h3><p></p></div><p>In March 2025, Apple released an updated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">MacBook Air</a>, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.</p><p>The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Airs have both previously received sizable discounts, though there aren’t any notable deals happening right now. That said, you can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> for $849.99 ($150 off) in most color options. The lowest price we’ve seen for this model takes $200 off the original cost. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $1,049 ($150 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDBDCFH?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1883968-REG%2Fapple_mw1l3ll_a_15_macbook_air_m4.html">B&amp;H Photo</a>, which is decent but not as good as the $999 sale price that was around for months.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0049.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZD9S5GC/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0049.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p><div><p><span>$850</span></p></div></div><div><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDBDCFH?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="The M4 MacBook Air sitting on a table in front of a plant." src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0183.webp?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDBDCFH?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="The M4 MacBook Air sitting on a table in front of a plant." src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0183.webp?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p><div><p><span>$1049</span></p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>The best MacBook Pro deals</h2><p></p></div><div><p></p><h3>M4 Pro MacBook Pro</h3><p></p></div><p>The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips launched with a big increase in RAM over the previous generation, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option.</p><p>As of right now, the M4 Pro-equipped MacBook Pro is the only model receiving significant discounts. For example, the 14-inch M4 Pro with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is available at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY2BJ6/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1859567-REG%2Fapple_mx2h3ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m4.html">B&amp;H Photo</a> starting at $1,799 ($200 off). It’s a solid discount, even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months.</p><p>The base 16-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is available with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,379 at Amazon, which isn’t great compared to previous deals.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY2BJ6/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="Someone using MacBook Pro with M4 Pro" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25706766/Apple_MacBook_Pro_M4_lifestyle_02.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY2BJ6/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="Someone using MacBook Pro with M4 Pro" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25706766/Apple_MacBook_Pro_M4_lifestyle_02.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p><div><p><span>$1799</span></p></div></div><div><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-14%E2%80%91core-20%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLHDCN6P?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/hermano/verge/product/image/10336/247412_Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_M4_Pro_OGrove_0005.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-14%E2%80%91core-20%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLHDCN6P?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/hermano/verge/product/image/10336/247412_Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_M4_Pro_OGrove_0005.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p><div><p><span>$2380</span></p></div></div><div><p></p><h3>M5 MacBook Pro</h3><p></p></div><p>Apple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/803349/apple-macbook-pro-14-m5-2025-review">our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto</a> had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.</p><p>The 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FWD5MR3L/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1925475-REG%2Fapple_mde04ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m5.html">B&amp;H Photo</a>, which is $100 shy of its best price to date. It’s worth picking over the M4 MacBook Pro, especially since that model is tough to find in stock and, more importantly, currently costs more than the newer, better version.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FWD5MR3L/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-14-in-lifestyle-work-251015.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=21.875%2C0%2C56.25%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FWD5MR3L/?tag=theverge02-20" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-14-in-lifestyle-work-251015.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p><div><p><span>$1449</span></p></div></div><div><p></p><h2>The best Mac Mini deals</h2><p></p></div><p>The newest Mac Minis in town are the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283861/apple-redesigned-mac-mini-macbook-pro-imac-m4-photos">M4-based models</a>, which arrived in 2024. Apple reduced the desktop’s horizontal footprint and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base-model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.</p><div><p></p><h3>M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini</h3><p></p></div><p>Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review">M4 Mac Mini</a> starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23762570/apple-mac-studio-m2-ultra-2023-review">Mac Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23770770/apple-mac-pro-m2-ultra-2023-review">Mac Pro</a> when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. The M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.</p><p>In addition to the odd decision to place the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282752/the-magic-mouse-haters-are-going-to-have-a-field-day-with-this-one">power button on its underside</a>, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.</p><p>In the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now, the sales aren’t particularly noteworthy.

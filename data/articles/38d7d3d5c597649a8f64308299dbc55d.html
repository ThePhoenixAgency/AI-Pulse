href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> will travel to Georgia tomorrow where he’ll visit two local businesses and give a speech on his “efforts to make life affordable for working people”.</p></article><article><header><h2>White House says parties are 'still pretty far apart' when it comes to DHS funding bill negotiations</h2></header><p>A White House official tells the Guardian the parties remain “pretty far apart” –&nbsp;after Democrats sent the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> its counter-proposal for a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill.</p><p>Currently, the department has been shut for days, following stalled negotations over a bill to secure DHS funding through September with tougher guardrails on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The official said that the administration “remains interested in good faith conversations to end the Democrat shutdown before more Americans feel the impacts” but also remains “committed to carrying out the President’s promise to enforce federal immigration law”.</p><p>On Monday, a spokesperson for Senate minority leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> said that Democrats had sent the White House their latest offer. For their part, <strong>GOP lawmakers said that Democrats’ demands – which include the use of judicial warrants for at-home arrests and ensuring officers no longer wear masks –&nbsp;are red lines</strong>.</p></article><article><header></header><p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) found there was “no violation” of its rules during Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl half-time show performance, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-agency-sought-transcript-bad-bunny-super-bowl-halftime-performance-2026-02-18/">Reuters reports</a>.</p><p>The FCC had requested transcripts of the performance from NBC, after a Republican lawmaker suggested that Bad Bunny’s performance may have violated federal indecency regulations.</p><p>The FCC commissioner, Anna Gomez, said she reviewed the transcripts of the performance in Spanish after the commission requested them.</p><p>“I reviewed them carefully, and I found no violation of our rules and no justification for harassing broadcasters over a standard live performance,” Gomez said.</p></article><article><header></header><p><strong>The Trump administration is working to block states and cities from offering free transportation to undocumented immigrants, according to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/18/dot-wants-to-block-transit-money-to-states-that-aid-migrants-00775657">reporting</a> from Politico.</strong></p><p>The outlet reported today that the Department of Transportation is drafting a law that would prohibit local jurisdictions from using federal transit money to assist undocumented migrants.</p><p>In some states and cities, officials have offered free buses to help migrants reach sources, including intake shelters or shelters.</p><p>“The change wouldn’t stop undocumented immigrants from using public transportation,” Politico reports. “However, it would seek to prevent local agencies or towns from using public transportation to move unauthorized immigrants around the city or outside it to another state, a person familiar with the plan said.”</p><p>The transportation department’s proposal is part of a package of measures that the White House is considering to include in the transportation reauthorization bill slated to go to Congress this year.</p></article><article><header></header><p>Democratic voters are still lacking optimism about their political party since President Donald Trump’s 2024 win, a recent poll reveals.</p><p><strong>Only around seven in </strong><strong>10 Democrats have a positive view of the Democratic </strong><strong>party,</strong> the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research <a href="https://apnews.com/article/poll-trump-democrats-republicans-parties-abc06b4ddc9b3aca7065ead47d43c75b">poll found</a>.</p><p>“While the overwhelming majority of Democrats still feel good about their party, they’re much less positive than they’ve been in the past,” the AP reports.</p><p>The midterm elections are still months away. Increasing negative views of Trump and other Republicans may help their party later this year. Favorable views of the Democratic party plummeted after the 2024 election.</p></article><article><header><h2>Several Democratic lawmakers plan to boycott State of the Union for National Mall rally</h2></header><p>Several Democratic lawmakers will boycott Donald Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday 24 February, and instead attend a rally on the National Mall.</p><p>So far, <strong>at least </strong><strong>12 Democratic members of Congress will skip the State of the Union</strong>. These include senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, as well as progressive representatives Pramila Jayapal and Greg Casar.</p><p>The event, dubbed the “People’s State of the Union”, is being coordinated by progressive media network MeidasTouch and the liberal advocacy group MoveOn. Attorney and commentator Katie Phang and former anchor Joy Reid will co-host the rally. The event’s organizers say it will spotlight federal workers, immigrants and Americans affected by the Trump administration’s policies.</p><p>In a statement, Van Hollen <a href="https://x.com/ChrisVanHollen/status/2024130982282961147?s=20">said </a>that he would not attend the joint address to Congress next week. “Trump is marching America towards fascism, and I refuse to normalize his shredding of our Constitution &amp; democracy,” he said. <strong>“This cannot be business as usual.”</strong></p></article><article><header><h2>Top oversight Democrat says that Wexner deposition is 'very important' for committee</h2></header><p><strong>Robert Garcia</strong>, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, said Les Wexner’s deposition will be “very important” to the ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes, in an interview with MSNOW on Tuesday.</p><p><strong>“You don’t pay a person the amount of money that Wexner was paying Epstein for just financial advice. They were very close for a long period of time,”</strong> Garcia said of the 88-year-old billionaire who employed Epstein as a personal money manager for 20 years. “We have a lot of questions about the finances, the relationship, what Wexner knew, who Jeffrey Epstein also received money from, what was actually Wexner’s larger involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell, and we hope those questions will be answered.”</p><figure><div><img alt="Robert Garcia speaks during a press conference on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the US Capitol, 18 November 2025." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8984147fc8e462e49014ccc86173d5e262d16164/0_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Robert Garcia speaks during a press conference on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the US Capitol, 18 November 2025.</span> Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>Garcia added that the questions from lawmakers to Wexner will be “pretty direct” during today’s deposition. <strong>“We know he has significant information as to why he was providing so much money to Epstein,”</strong> he said. The lawmaker is also determined to understand why Wexner’s name – along with those of other high profile men – were redacted in the justice department’s latest release of documents.</p><p>“Why the cover-up? Why we protecting possible co conspirators? Why are we protecting Jeffrey Epstein’s, essentially, benefactors?,” Garcia said.</p></article><article><header><h2>Talarico says campaign raised $2.5m in the immediate aftermath of Colbert interview controversy</h2></header><p>Following the decision by The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to air its interview with James Talarico on YouTube, the Texas Democratic Senate candidate said that <strong>his campaign <a href="https://x.com/jamestalarico/status/2024124888391287234?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">raised $2.5m </a>in the 24 hours since Colbert said that CBS told him not to air the segment</strong>, for fear of triggering the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) equal-time rule.</p><figure><div><img alt="James Talarico answers questions from reporters after early voting in Austin, Texas, on Tuesday." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99690d3ef5813fd2fcb3ff7fae25d632ac73236e/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>James Talarico answers questions from reporters after early voting in Austin, Texas, 17 February 2026.</span> Photograph: Mikala Compton/AP</figcaption></figure></article><article><header><h2>Crockett praises move from Colbert to air Talarico interview on YouTube: 'It probably gave my opponent the boost he was looking for'</h2></header><p><a href="https://www.ms.now/the-briefing-with-jen-psaki/watch/rep-crockett-speaks-out-on-cbs-colbert-controversy-with-her-opponent-2487776835719">In an interview with MSNOW</a>, Democratic congresswoman <strong>Jasmine Crockett</strong> addressed the claims from Stephen Colbert that CBS <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2026/feb/17/colbert-trump-administration-censorship-cbs">told him not to air a television interview </a>with James Talarico, the Texas state lawmaker running for US Senate. Colbert said the decision stemmed from a concern that it would trigger a legal requirement to provide equal access to Talarico’s campaign rivals –&nbsp;which includes Crockett.</p><p>The congresswoman said that her team received a call from Paramount Skydance –&nbsp;CBS’s parent company –&nbsp;who told her that Colbert could, in fact, move forward with airing the Talarico interview but would need to offer Crockett equal time.</p><p><strong>“I did not get a request from the Colbert show to go on</strong> … I’ve been on Colbert multiple times, and frankly, if we would have gotten an offer that would have been great, but we’re in the middle of early voting, so I’m kind of focused on being in Texas at this moment,” Crockett told MS Now.</p><figure><div><img alt="Jasmine Crockett speaks to reporters and supporters before voting early in the primary election, in Dallas, 17 February 2026." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6804ca2b27006ceff9fbd04b6b497b682f6f0191/860_0_4058_3249/master/4058.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Jasmine Crockett speaks to reporters and supporters before voting early in the primary election, in Dallas, on Tuesday.</span> Photograph: LM Otero/AP</figcaption></figure><p>In the end, the Talarico interview was instead broadcast on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiTJ7Pz_59A">Colbert’s YouTube page</a>, which is out of the remit of the FCC. In a statement, CBS said that The Late Show was not prohibited from broadcasting the segment, instead the network “provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates”.</p><p>Speaking to MS Now, Crockett added that she had “no love” for CBS News editor Bari Weiss, nor for the FCC chair Brendan Carr. “It is important that we resist,” she said. <strong>“I think it probably gave my opponent the </strong><strong>boost he was looking for so I think it’s probably better than he didn’t get on, and that they went straight to streaming.”</strong></p></article><article><header><h2>Oversight committee to depose Victoria's Secret CEO, amid renewed scrutiny over ties to Epstein</h2></header><p>Today, congressional lawmakers on the House oversight committee continue their investigation into the handling of Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes with a deposition of <strong>Les Wexner</strong>, the billionaire and former CEO of Victoria’s Secret.</p><p>Wexner is facing scrutiny for his association with Epstein – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/17/les-wexner-jeffrey-epstein">who served as his personal money manager </a>from the mid-1980s until 2007, when Epstein was under investigation for sex crimes. He then stepped away from managing Wexner’s personal finances. The businessman, who also owned Bath &amp; Body Works, later discovered that Epstein had been mismanaging funds, and severed ties with him.</p><p>While Wexner has vehemently denied any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, he is under renewed dissection after his name appeared in the latest tranche of documents released by the justice department, which showed a 2019 FBI document that listed Wexner as a co-conspirator of Epstein. The 88-year old has never been convicted of a crime, and maintains that he has cooperated with officials at each juncture of their investigations into Epstein, who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019.</p><p>Last week, congressman <strong>Ro Khanna</strong>, revealed that Wexner’s name was one of six high-profile men whose names were redacted in the latest document drop by the Department of Justice.</p><p>Wexner will testify for lawmakers in New Albany, Ohio, and several Democratic members of the committee will hold a press conference after the deposition.</p><figure><div><img alt="Les Wexner tours the exhibit at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, 19 September 2014." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b568ee46e4cbd4de9fd19efb60a45628b7bbaa0/163_0_1811_1449/master/1811.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Les Wexner tours the exhibit at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, 19 September 2014.</span> Photograph: Jay LaPrete/AP</figcaption></figure></article></div></div>

<p><strong>Google released an emergency Chrome update on Friday to patch a zero-day vulnerability that has been exploited in the wild.</strong>



</p><p>Chrome 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows/Mac and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux fix CVE-2026-2441, described as a high-severity use-after-free vulnerability in the browser’s CSS component.



</p><p>“Google is aware that an exploit for CVE-2026-2441 exists in the wild,” Google said in its <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2026/02/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_13.html">advisory</a>.



</p><p>Google has credited researcher Shaheen Fazim for reporting the vulnerability. The actively exploited flaw was disclosed to the vendor on February 11, only two days before it was patched. 



</p><p>Fazim was credited by Google last year for responsibly disclosing several high-severity Chrome vulnerabilities. 



</p><p>A bug bounty reward for CVE-2026-2441 has not yet been determined. Some of his previous reports earned the researcher $7,000 and $8,000.</p>



<p>There appears to be no public information about attacks exploiting CVE-2026-2441. However, based on the little information shared by Google the vulnerability can likely be exploited for arbitrary code execution by getting the targeted user to visit a malicious website.



</p><p>However, the code would be executed within a sandbox, and an additional vulnerability is likely needed to escape the sandbox and achieve complete system takeover.



</p><p>Nevertheless, the vulnerability could be useful for stealing data from the browser, hijacking sessions, and conducting further attacks.



</p><p>Several <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/topics/Chrome/">Chrome</a> zero-days were patched in 2025. Google’s own zero-day tracker lists six flaws, while CISA’s KEV catalog includes seven.

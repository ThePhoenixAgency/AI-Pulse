Although the 42mm version of the device typically boasts a price tag of $399, it is has now dropped to its lowest price yet of $299, which makes it a great purchase considering it's quite a recent piece of hardware.</p> <p>The smartwatch comes with a "superdurable" glass display that is twice as scratch-resistant as the previous Series 10 model, according to Apple. In addition, it also sports a water resistance rating of 50m, making it swimproof, along with a dust resistance rating of IP6X. In addition, it is powered by a decent battery that can last up to day, and you can even use it for up to 8 hours after just 15 minutes of fast charging.</p> <p>In terms of fitness features and other software-based capabilities, the Apple Watch Series 11 touts the following:</p> <ul> <li>Blood Oxygen app</li> <li>ECG app</li> <li>Cycle Tracking app with retrospective ovulation estimates4</li> <li>Heart Rate app</li> <li>High and low heart rate notifications</li> <li>Irregular rhythm notifications</li> <li>Medications app</li> <li>Mindfulness app with state of mind tracking</li> <li>Noise app</li> <li>Sleep app including sleep stages</li> <li>Sleep score</li> <li>Sleep apnea notifications</li> <li>Hypertension notifications</li>
</ul> <p>Perhaps its highlight is the last feature in the aforementioned list, hypertension alerts. The watch is capable of detecting signs of chronic high blood pressure and alerting the user about hypertension issues. This potentially makes it a life-saver for people who suffer from blood pressure problems. Apple has also boasted about the Watch Series 11's thin and lightweight design, making it comfortable to wear during fitness and sleep sessions.</p> <figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/09/1757438818_img_0021.webp"><img alt="An overview of the Apple Watch Series 11 features" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/09/1757438818_img_0021_story.webp"></a></figure> <p>Right now, various versions of the Apple Watch Series 11 are on discount on Amazon US for a limited time only.

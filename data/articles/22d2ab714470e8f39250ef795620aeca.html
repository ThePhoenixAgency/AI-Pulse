He had led Zambia from 2015 until 2021, when he lost elections by a huge margin to current President Hakainde Hichilema.</p></div><div><p>The Zambian government wants Lungu's remains to be repatriated and given a state funeral, with full state honours - and a South African court ruled in its favour in August.</p></div><div><p>But Lungu's family want a private burial in South Africa as they say the former president had not wanted Hichilema to attend his funeral. The relationship between the two politicians had long been fraught.</p></div><div><p>In the letter to the South African police, dated 11 February 2026, Mashele Attorneys confirmed that on behalf of the Lungu family it had "complied with the five subpoenas issued" in relation to a criminal probe looking into allegations that the former Zambian president was poisoned.</p></div><div><p>"For the avoidance of doubt, it is our clients' instruction that the allegations underlying the criminal case are denied," the letter said.</p></div><div><p>Neo Mashele, from Mashele Attorneys, told the BBC the investigation by police appeared to be based on a "public utterance" about a poisoning allegation made by one of Lungu's daughters that was "absolutely not true".</p></div><div><p>In its letter, Mashele Attorneys also raised concern over another subpoena it said had been issued by police to the funeral home looking after Lungu's body.</p></div><div><p>It said there were two High Court orders that directed that "possession and custody of the body remain with Two Mountains Funeral Services pending the finalisation of the legal proceedings".</p></div><div><p>"Those orders are binding and operative," the letter said.</p></div><div><p>An official from the morgue where the remains are being stored told the BBC that Lungu's body was "under tight security [and] surveillance 24/7".</p></div><div><p>Mrs Lungu has remained in South Africa since the death of her husband and is leading legal efforts to have him buried in South Africa.</p></div><div><p><i>Additional reporting by Nomsa Maseko</i></p></div><div><p><span>You may also be interested in:</span></p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa"><span>Getty Images/BBC</span></p></div></figure></div><div><p><span>BBC Africa podcasts</span></p></div></article></div></div>

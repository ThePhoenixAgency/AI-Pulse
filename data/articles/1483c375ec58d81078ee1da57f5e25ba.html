  <div class="content"><p>Domestic robots have been a fixture in science fiction novels for more than a century, but in the real world we’re still all doing our own domestic chores barring vacuuming. While a number of companies are working on humanoid robots, with Apple reportedly among them, all we’ve really had so far are promises and extremely limited demos. But you can (maybe) buy a laundry-folding robot today for $8,000 or rent it for $450 a month … Isaac 0 is available to purchase, with delivery promised for this month – but only if you live in the Bay Area of California. Isaac 0 is a stationary laundry folding robot, and it’s already in our first customers’ home less than a year and a half after Weave’s founding. It can be installed in an afternoon and gets the job done from day one: plop it anywhere with a desk in your home, plug it into a regular wall outlet. Drop a load of laundry and walk away: Isaac 0 works for 30-90 minutes, and you’ll return to find clean stacks of clothes waiting for you. As with other attempts at humanoid robots, this one has limited autonomous capabilities. It takes what seems to be the now-standard approach of having remote operators standing by to take over when it runs into difficulties. Isaac 0 is a learning robot: it gets better over time. It runs autonomously as much as possible, and if it gets stuck on a particularly difficult garment, or makes a mistake it doesn’t yet know how to correct, a Weave specialist can sub in remotely for a 5-10 second correction and hand back off to the robot.&nbsp; That means you are going to have human beings looking at the inside of your home through the robot’s cameras. The Verge note that it can’t cope with large blankets, bedsheets, or clothing that has come out of the washer inside-out. Additionally, looking at the promo video below, it doesn’t really seem to do a particularly good job. Would you be tempted if it were available in your area? Let us know in the comments.

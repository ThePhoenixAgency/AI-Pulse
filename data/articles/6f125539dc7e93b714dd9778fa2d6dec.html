</ul><h2>📉 Coinbase Drops a $667M Loss</h2><p>On Tuesday, Coinbase <a href="https://decrypt.co/357813/coinbase-launches-wallet-ai-agents-built-in-guardrails" target="_blank">unveiled Agentic Wallets</a>—its thesis on the future of AI x crypto.</p><p>On Wednesday, it reminded everyone just how painful the present is.</p><p>📌 What Happened</p><p>Coinbase <a href="https://decrypt.co/357925/coinbase-q4-miss-667-million-loss-bitcoin-retreat" target="_blank">reported</a> Q4 2025 earnings Thursday that missed across the board.</p><p>Revenue came in at $1.78 billion, down 22% year-over-year and below the $1.84 billion analysts expected.</p><p>The net loss of $667 million was a stark reversal from the $1.3 billion profit Coinbase posted in Q4 2024, when Trump’s election sent crypto surging.</p><p>This time, the driver was a $718 million unrealized writedown on Coinbase’s crypto investment portfolio, plus $395 million in strategic investment losses, including its stake in Circle.</p><p>Transaction revenue fell to $983 million, down 6% quarter-over-quarter and 37% below 2024's Q4 surge.</p><p>Operating expenses went the wrong way, up 9% to $1.5 billion, while stock-based compensation added another $250 million. CEO Brian Armstrong sold more than $500 million in personal shares over the past nine months. CFO Alesia Haas sold $56.5 million worth on Feb. 6.</p><p>COIN fell 7.9% to $141 before earnings, then whipsawed in after-hours, dropping to $135 before bouncing to $147.</p><p>It has since jumped early Friday, recently trading at $163 after a nearly 16% spike. Even so, COIN is down nearly 50% over the last six months.</p><p>🗣️ What They’re Saying</p><p>Anil Gupta, Coinbase VP of Investor Relations, told <i>Decrypt</i> the portfolio loss is unrealized: <i>“It’s more of a buy and hold situation. We’re not selling any of the portfolio from a profit recognition standpoint.”</i></p><div><blockquote>
<p>It’s earnings day. 2025 was a strong year for Coinbase, and we built a solid foundation for continued growth in 2026.</p>
<p>Our thesis is actually very simple: crypto is updating all financial services, and we're the best positioned company to capitalize on this transformation.</p>
<p>Some… <a href="https://t.co/G57YvNE36j">pic.twitter.com/G57YvNE36j</a></p>
<p>— Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/2022062627518652512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote></div><p>🧠 Why It Matters</p><p>The largest U.S. crypto exchange dropped a $667 million loss the same week it launched the product it says will power the future of agentic commerce.</p><p>But zoom out from the headline loss and the picture gets more interesting.</p><ul>
<li>Full-year trading volume hit $5.2 trillion, up 156% year-over-year.</li>
<li>Global market share doubled to 6.4%.</li>
<li>Stablecoin revenue reached $364 million in Q4, up 61% YoY.</li>
<li>Coinbase One hit 971,000 subscribers.</li>
<li>The company has 12 products generating $100 million+ in annualized revenue.</li>
<li>And it’s sitting on $11.3 billion in cash.</li>
</ul><p>Those are all real reasons for optimism. The Q1 outlook is sobering, though.</p><p>Subscription revenue is guided to $550-630 million, down from $727 million. Transaction revenue through Feb. 10 was only $420 million. And with Standard Chartered <a href="https://decrypt.co/357858/bitcoin-50k-ethereum-1400-before-rebound-standard-chartered" target="_blank">calling for Bitcoin falling to $50,000</a> before a rebound, the trading fee drought isn’t ending soon.</p><p>So where does this leave us?</p><p>Coinbase is betting on infrastructure (agentic wallets, x402, Base, stock trading, Deribit) to be the company that powers crypto’s next phase. But right now, it’s still a trading business in a market down 47% from the top.</p><p>The transition may be painful. But there is light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>And COIN as a levered crypto bet remains a real thesis to consider—just note that levered bets work both ways.</p><h2><strong>🌎 Macro Crypto and Markets</strong></h2><ul>

Crypto majors rising since early morning, BTC at $69K
Coinbase misses Q4 earnings, revenue down 22% YoY
CFTC names dozens of crypto execs to its Innovation Advisory Committee
Solana announces Graveyard Hack to resurrect dead sectors
Aave Labs shares new proposal to send 100% of revenue to the DAO Coinbase Drops a $667M LossOn Tuesday, Coinbase unveiled Agentic Wallets—its thesis on the future of AI x crypto.On Wednesday, it reminded everyone just how painful the present is. What HappenedCoinbase&nbsp;reported&nbsp;Q4 2025 earnings Thursday that missed across the board.Revenue came in at $1.78 billion, down 22% year-over-year and below the $1.84 billion analysts expected.The net loss of $667 million was a stark reversal from the $1.3 billion profit Coinbase posted in Q4 2024, when Trump’s election sent crypto surging.This time, the driver was a $718 million unrealized writedown on Coinbase’s crypto investment portfolio, plus $395 million in strategic investment losses, including its stake in Circle.Transaction revenue fell to $983 million, down 6% quarter-over-quarter and 37% below 2024's Q4 surge.Operating expenses went the wrong way, up 9% to $1.5 billion, while stock-based compensation added another $250 million. CEO Brian Armstrong sold more than $500 million in personal shares over the past nine months. CFO Alesia Haas sold $56.5 million worth on Feb. 6.COIN fell 7.9% to $141 before earnings, then whipsawed in after-hours, dropping to $135 before bouncing to $147.It has since jumped early Friday, recently trading at $163 after a nearly 16% spike. Even so, COIN is down nearly 50% over the last six months. What They’re SayingAnil Gupta, Coinbase VP of Investor Relations, told Decrypt the portfolio loss is unrealized:&nbsp;“It’s more of a buy and hold situation. We’re not selling any of the portfolio from a profit recognition standpoint.”
It’s earnings day. 2025 was a strong year for Coinbase, and we built a solid foundation for continued growth in 2026.
Our thesis is actually very simple: crypto is updating all financial services, and we're the best positioned company to capitalize on this transformation.

— Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 12, 2026 Why It MattersThe largest U.S. crypto exchange dropped a $667 million loss the same week it launched the product it says will power the future of agentic commerce.But zoom out from the headline loss and the picture gets more interesting.
Full-year trading volume hit $5.2 trillion, up 156% year-over-year.
Global market share doubled to 6.4%.
Stablecoin revenue reached $364 million in Q4, up 61% YoY.
Coinbase One hit 971,000 subscribers.
The company has 12 products generating $100 million+ in annualized revenue.
And it’s sitting on $11.3 billion in cash.
Those are all real reasons for optimism. The Q1 outlook is sobering, though.Subscription revenue is guided to $550-630 million, down from $727 million. Transaction revenue through Feb. 10 was only $420 million. And with Standard Chartered calling for Bitcoin falling to $50,000 before a rebound, the trading fee drought isn’t ending soon.So where does this leave us?Coinbase is betting on infrastructure (agentic wallets, x402, Base, stock trading, Deribit) to be the company that powers crypto’s next phase. But right now, it’s still a trading business in a market down 47% from the top.The transition may be painful. But there is light at the end of the tunnel.And COIN as a levered crypto bet remains a real thesis to consider—just note that levered bets work both ways. Macro Crypto and Markets

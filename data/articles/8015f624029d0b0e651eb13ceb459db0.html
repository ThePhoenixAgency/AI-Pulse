    <div><div><p>Almost 60 Palestinian journalists detained in Israeli prisons since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack have been beaten, starved and subjected to sexual violence, including rape, a report alleges.</p><p>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reviewed dozens of testimonies, photographs and medical records documenting what it describes as serious abuses by Israeli soldiers and prison guards against Palestinian reporters. The report draws on in-depth interviews from 59 Palestinian journalists. Of those interviewed, 58 reported being subjected to what they described as torture while in Israeli custody.</p><p>“While conditions varied at different facilities, the methods those interviewed recounted – physical assaults, forced stress positions, sensory deprivation, sexual violence, and medical neglect – were strikingly consistent,” the report states.</p><p>The Israeli prison service and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have both strongly rejected the allegations.</p><figure><div><img alt="Composite picture of Sai smiling in sunglasses and looking much thinner on a couch " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b640cc6b0630864872ae742d9517e0b7479f520d/0_0_512_288/master/512.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Sami al-Sai before and after his arrest by Israeli authorities.</span> Photograph: Handout</figcaption></figure><p>Journalist <a href="https://cpj.org/2025/12/palestinian-journalist-sami-al-sai-alleges-torture-sexual-violence-in-israeli-prison/">Sami al-Sai</a>, who has reported for the Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera Mubasher and the local broadcaster Al-Fajer TV, said he was taken to a small cell in Megiddo prison, and soldiers removed his trousers and underwear, and penetrated him with batons and other objects.</p><p>“I did not speak to anyone inside the prison about what happened, except for two senior detainees who have been imprisoned for 25 years,” Sai said.</p><p>In December 2025, German journalist Anne Liedtke, detained onboard a Gaza-bound flotilla, alleged Israeli soldiers <a href="https://freedomflotilla.org/2026/01/02/ffc-condemns-sexual-assaults/">raped her</a> while in custody. Italian journalist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNzEpgF0KBK/?hl=en">Vincenzo Fullone</a> and Australian activist Surya McEwen made similar accusations.</p><p><a href="https://cpj.org/data/people/shadi-abu-sido/">Shadi Abu Sido</a>, a Palestinian journalist from Gaza who works for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories">Palestine</a> Today, was released after 20 months in detention <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/23/whistleblowers-allege-widespread-abuses-at-israeli-detention-camp-sde-teiman">at Sde Teiman</a> last October. He had been seized by Israeli forces at al-Shifa hospital on 18 March 2024, and said he “was shackled, blindfolded, and forced through a corridor of soldiers who beat him with batons and kicks”. He later learned he had a broken rib.</p><figure><div><img alt="Triple composite picture showing person’s limbs with apparent injuries" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a0219fb11b956b3cb27c65bdf842948fcc69ee7/0_0_1200_600/master/1200.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Images show some of the injuries journalist Shadi Abu Sido reported sustaining while in prison.</span> Photograph: Handout</figcaption></figure><p>At Ofer prison, radio journalist Mohammad al-Atrash described a coordinated mass assault in November 2023 involving dozens of prisoners, that he and other detainees called “a Shin Bet party” or a “Ben-Gvir party” (named after Israeli far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir). Al-Atrash stated that “trained dogs were ordered to attack the detainees, and metal instruments were used to create long-lasting bleeding and scars”.</p><p><a href="https://cpj.org/data/people/osama-al-sayed/">Osama al-Sayed</a>, a report from Al-Aqsa TV, recounted the intermittent use of electroshocking and pepper spray between beatings, which took place shortly after a visit to the prison by Ben-Gvir.</p><p>Eleven Palestinian journalists cited the use of a torture method known as strappado, or what the Palestinian journalists termed “ghost hanging”, in which a person is suspended by their arms, bound behind the back, and then pulled upward.</p><p>Fifty-five of the 59 journalists interviewed reported extreme hunger or malnutrition.</p><p>Photographs shared with the Guardian by the CPJ show the journalists before and after their detention, showing visibly gaunt and physically diminished men.</p><p>The CPJ calculated an average weight loss of 23.5kg (52 pounds) among the group by comparing journalists’ reported weight before and after detention.</p><figure><div><img alt="Composite image of man taking picture and then another of him with top off looking thin and emaciated" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97c562cfe37563c7afac5058d3cbfdae169a2b05/0_0_512_288/master/512.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Journalist Mohammad Badr, pictured before and after his spell in prison, said he was struck so hard his tongue was cut, and he could barely speak or eat for two weeks.

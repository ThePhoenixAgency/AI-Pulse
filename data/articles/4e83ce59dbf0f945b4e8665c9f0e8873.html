January.</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>US investigators have reportedly been in touch with Mexican authorities about the disappearance of American news anchor Savannah Guthrie's mother, as the search stretches into a third week.</p></div><div><p>The sheriff's department in the US state of Arizona and FBI declined to confirm they had contacted authorities across the border to help trace Nancy Guthrie.</p></div><div><p>But her family has contacted a Mexican non-profit that works to find missing people in the region.</p></div><div><p>Investigators have been sifting through 40,000 leads since the 84-year-old was reported missing this month, but a breakthrough has eluded them despite emotional public appeals for help from her NBC presenter daughter.</p></div><div><p>US news website TMZ reported on Wednesday that the FBI had contacted authorities in Mexico, believing it was possible Guthrie could have been taken across the border.</p></div><div><p>ABC News cited law enforcement sources as saying the FBI had notified Mexican authorities of Guthrie's disappearance, although they had no evidence she had been taken across the border.</p></div><div><figure><p></p><figcaption>'I just believe she's somewhere here locally', Pima County sheriff tells BBC</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>A Mexican security official told the New York Times the FBI had contacted officials in the state of Sonora, which shares a border with Arizona, to investigate an alleged "purchase" in the case, although that potential lead had apparently fizzled.</p></div><div><p>It is standard practice for federal investigators to talk with Mexican counterparts, especially in cases so close to the border, Fox News reports.</p></div><div><p>The Searching Mothers of Sonora, a Mexican non-profit dedicated to finding missing people in that state, often in cases linked to drug cartels, confirmed to CBS, the BBC's US partner, that it had been asked by a Guthrie family member to help the search. </p></div><div><p>There has been no suggestion from officials that Guthrie was abducted by narco-traffickers.</p></div><div><figure><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's home</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>TMZ also said it had received a new ransom note via email demanding about $6m in cryptocurrency.</p></div><div><p>The outlet, which previously reported receiving another possible Guthrie ransom note, said it had forwarded the new email to the FBI.</p></div><div><p>Guthrie was last seen at her Tucson, Arizona, home on 31 January when a family member dropped her off there after an evening at her daughter's house nearby.</p></div><div><p>Investigators believe she was abducted in the early hours of 1 February.</p></div><div><p>Officials say her family members have been ruled out as possible suspects.</p></div><div><p>On Tuesday, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told the BBC that DNA evidence taken from a glove found near Guthrie's home had produced no matches in a FBI database.</p></div><div><p>The glove had appeared to match ones worn by a masked man captured on surveillance footage on the night Guthrie vanished.</p></div><div><figure><p></p><figcaption>Watch: 'It is never too late to do the right thing' Savannah Guthrie says in appeal to suspected abductor</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>The sheriff said he was confident they would find her, whether it took "10 days, 10 months, or worse".</p></div><div><p>Nanos also said he believed Guthrie was being held somewhere close to her home.</p></div><div><p>The sheriff also told the BBC's US partner CBS News on Wednesday that investigators had not ruled out a theory that an accomplice was also involved in the suspected abduction. </p></div><div><p>Investigators are now using a device that might be able to detect Bluetooth signals coming from her pacemaker, law enforcement sources told CBS.</p></div><div><p>The sources said the tool, called a "signal sniffer", was mounted on a helicopter.</p></div><div><p>Guthrie's pacemaker was disconnected from her phone app on the night of her disappearance.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img

I am going to play football - that is my love."</p></div><div><p></p><h2>Finding employment through football</h2><p></p></div><div><p>Girls who marry as children are at increased risk of sexual coercion, early pregnancy, malnutrition and poorer health, according to many studies.</p></div><div><p>They are also more likely to leave education early, reducing their chances to improve their life circumstances.</p></div><div><p>Padma Joshi, from Football for Freedom, which is part of the Mahila Jan Adhikar Samiti women's rights non-profit organisation, wants to educate families about these risks.</p></div><div><p>She says Football for Freedom has trained about 800 girls across 13 villages in Rajasthan since it was formed in 2016.</p></div><div><p>"When we started talking to parents we never said that we were introducing football to stop child marriage," says Joshi.</p></div><div><p>Joshi explains to parents that excelling at football could ultimately help their girls get jobs, as Indian states set aside some public sector roles for sportsmen and women.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/01fe/live/a8617290-d1c0-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp" alt="Laali is sitting on a verandar at her home dressed in a bright pink and orange tunic and trousers, with a head covering and bright orange scarf.

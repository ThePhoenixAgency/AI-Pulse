    <div><div><p>ARK Invest has returned to buying shares of Coinbase Global after trimming its position, adding roughly $15 million worth of stock across several of its actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Friday.</p><p>The Cathie Wood-led asset manager purchased 66,545 Coinbase shares through the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), 16,832 shares through Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and 9,477 shares through Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), according to the firm’s daily trade disclosures.</p><p>The buying activity coincided with a sharp surge in Coinbase stock. Shares closed the trading session at $164.32, up about 16.4% on the day, before edging higher in after-hours trading, <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/COIN:NASDAQ?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLmY3i0NiSAxWQRfEDHTc8GycQ3ecFKAR6BAgmEAU" target="_blank">according</a> to data from Google Finance. The surge put the firm’s total purchase at roughly $15.2 million.</p><p>Alongside Coinbase, ARK also increased its stake in Roblox Corporation, buying shares in ARKK, ARKW and ARKF. Roblox closed near $63.17 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. </p><figure>    <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c5ba6-688e-7968-a175-9a1c87c44123.PNG" /><figcaption><em>Coinbase shares surged 16% on Friday.

Shares of Coinbase fell more sharply than both Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) and Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH</a>) during the quarter. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-backstreet-boys-karaoke-return-super-bowl-ad"><em><strong>Coinbase bets on Backstreet Boys nostalgia in return to Super Bowl</strong></em></a></p><h2>Coinbase posts $667 million Q4 loss </h2><p>Coinbase <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-667m-loss-q4-earnings-miss-crypto-market-crash">reported a net loss of $667 million</a> in the fourth quarter of 2025, ending an eight-quarter run of profitability. Earnings per share came in at 66 cents, missing analyst expectations of 92 cents, while net revenue fell 21.5% year-over-year to $1.78 billion. Transaction revenue dropped nearly 37% to $982.7 million, although subscription and services revenue rose more than 13% to $727.4 million.</p><p>The weaker results coincided with a downturn in crypto markets. Coinbase said it generated $420 million in transaction revenue early in Q1 but expects subscription and services revenue to decline. </p><p><em><strong>Magazine: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/meet-gracy-chen-tv-star-only-female-ceo-crypto-exchange/"><em><strong>Bitget’s Gracy Chen is looking for ‘entrepreneurs, not wantrepreneurs’</strong></em></a></p></div><p>Cointelegraph is committed to independent, transparent journalism.

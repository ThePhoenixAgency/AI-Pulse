His actions fundamentally damaged South Korea's democracy and deserves a harsh punishment, presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon told the court. </p></div><div><p>Though it was short-lived, Yoon's martial law order left the nation<a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv4p95m6vo"> more polarised than ever</a>, and those deep divisions were on full display as the sentencing took place.</p></div><div><p>Huge crowds of Yoon's supporters gathered outside the court hours before the hearing, holding banners reading "Yoon, again". Many of them broke down in tears following the verdict.</p></div><div><p>Also present were anti-Yoon protesters, rallying for him to be sentenced to death.</p></div><div><p>Yoon himself showed no emotion as he learned of his fate. His lawyers alleged that the verdict was not backed by evidence and accused the judge of following a "pre-written script".</p></div><div><p>If either side launches an appeal, the case will go up to the Supreme Court, which means it could be months before the verdict is finalised.</p></div><div><p>Yoon shocked his nation on 3 December 2024 by declaring martial law on live television. </p></div><div><p>He claimed it was to protect the country from "anti-state" forces that sympathised with North Korea, but it soon became clear he was <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7jxe88w3o">driven by domestic troubles</a>: the opposition which held a parliamentary majority left him a lame duck president, while his wife Kim Keon Hee was at the centre of various corruption allegations.</p></div><div><p>What followed were months of political chaos, <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01mjv0v0go">Yoon's impeachment</a>, and a string of indictments against him and other top officials.</p></div><div><p>Former prime minister Han Duck-soo was handed a 23-year jail term last month for his part in the insurrection, while ex-defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who advised Yoon to impose martial law, was jailed for 30 years on Thursday.</p></div><div><p>Former interior minister Lee Sang-min, former intelligence commander Roh Sang-won, and ex-police chief Cho Ji-ho were among the other officials jailed for what judges have described as "an insurrection from the top".</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1522/live/b40afac0-0d71-11f1-b1f2-a50c2c5773ab.jpg.webp" alt="AFP via Getty Images A female Yoon supporter, who's holding a flat, and wearing a visor, sunglases and a winter coat, cries out as the verdict is delivered"><span>AFP via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Many of Yoon's supporters broke down in tears following the verdict</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Security was tight outside the court on Thursday, with dozens of police buses forming a cordon to restrict public access. Some 1,000 officers were deployed for security operations, local media reported.</p></div><div><p>Inside the court, judge Ji called Yoon the "insurrectionist leader", although the judging panel found insufficient evidence to rule that he'd planned the martial law order a year before his announcement.</p></div><div><p>Yoon defended his actions throughout his trial, arguing that as president he had had the authority to declare martial law, sounding the alarm over opposition parties' obstruction of government.</p></div><div><p>He maintained that the order was necessary "to protect the freedom and sovereignty of the people and to preserve the nation and its constitution".</p></div><div><p>The ruling Democratic Party, which <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq549p1yd2eo">won the presidential election</a> after Yoon's ouster, accused the court of "undermining judicial justice" by not sentencing Yoon to death. </p></div><div><p>"[Yoon] masterminded an insurrection that shook the very foundations of our nation," party leader Jung Chung-rae said.</p></div><div><p>"[Today's decision] is a clear regress from the people's revolution... The public will find it deeply unsatisfactory and unacceptable."</p></div><div><p>South Korea has not executed anyone on death row since December 1997, so even a death penalty for Yoon would, in effect, be life imprisonment.</p></div><div><p>Yoon is <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4qdpxp78po">already serving jail time</a> for abuse of power and obstructing his own arrest after the martial law order. He still faces three more related trials.</p></div><div><p>Several former presidents before Yoon had <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93gqwek5jyo">also been convicted and jailed</a>, but were pardoned after serving just two to five years in prison – and many expect the same for Yoon.</p></div><div><p><i>Additional reporting by Leehyun Choi and Hosu Lee, in Seoul</i></p></div></article></div></div>

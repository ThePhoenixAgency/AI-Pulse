The company did state that its Usage Policy with the Pentagon was under review, with specific reference to “our hard limits around fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance.”</p><p>Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell stated that “Our nation requires that our partners be willing to help our warfighters win in any fight.”</p>

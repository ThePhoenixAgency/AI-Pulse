  <div class="content">
    <p><p>When the creator of the world&#x27;s most advanced coding agent speaks, Silicon Valley doesn&#x27;t just listen — it takes notes.</p><p>For the past week, the engineering community has been dissecting a <a href="https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177">thread on X</a> from <a href="https://x.com/bcherny">Boris Cherny</a>, the creator and head of <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview">Claude Code</a> at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>. What began as a casual sharing of his personal terminal setup has spiraled into a viral manifesto on the future of software development, with industry insiders calling it a watershed moment for the startup.</p><div></div><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re not reading the Claude Code best practices straight from its creator, you&#x27;re behind as a programmer,&quot; wrote <a href="https://x.com/jefftangx">Jeff Tang</a>, a prominent voice in the developer community. <a href="https://x.com/KyleMcnease/status/2007555584724480338">Kyle McNease</a>, another industry observer, went further, declaring that with Cherny&#x27;s &quot;game-changing updates,&quot; Anthropic is &quot;on fire,&quot; potentially facing &quot;their ChatGPT moment.&quot;</p><p>The excitement stems from a paradox: Cherny&#x27;s workflow is surprisingly simple, yet it allows a single human to operate with the output capacity of a small engineering department. As one user noted on X after implementing Cherny&#x27;s setup, the experience &quot;<a href="https://x.com/mtwichan">feels more like Starcraft</a>&quot; than traditional coding — a shift from typing syntax to commanding autonomous units.</p><p>Here is an analysis of the workflow that is reshaping how software gets built, straight from the architect himself. </p><h2><b>How running five AI agents at once turns coding into a real-time strategy game</b></h2><p>The most striking revelation from Cherny&#x27;s disclosure is that he does not code in a linear fashion. In the traditional &quot;<a href="https://notes.paulswail.com/public/The+inner+and+outer+loops+of+software+development+workflow">inner loop</a>&quot; of development, a programmer writes a function, tests it, and moves to the next. Cherny, however, acts as a fleet commander.</p><p>&quot;I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal,&quot; Cherny wrote. &quot;I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input.&quot;</p><p>By utilizing iTerm2 system notifications, Cherny effectively manages five simultaneous work streams. While one agent runs a test suite, another refactors a legacy module, and a third drafts documentation. He also runs &quot;5-10 Claudes on <a href="https://claude.ai/">claude.ai</a>&quot; in his browser, using a &quot;teleport&quot; command to hand off sessions between the web and his local machine.</p><p>This validates the &quot;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/03/anthropic-daniela-amodei-do-more-with-less-bet.html">do more with less</a>&quot; strategy articulated by Anthropic President Daniela Amodei earlier this week. While competitors like OpenAI pursue trillion-dollar infrastructure build-outs, Anthropic is proving that superior orchestration of existing models can yield exponential productivity gains.</p><h2><b>The counterintuitive case for choosing the slowest, smartest model</b></h2><p>In a surprising move for an industry obsessed with latency, Cherny revealed that he exclusively uses Anthropic&#x27;s heaviest, slowest model: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5">Opus 4.5</a>.</p><p>&quot;I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything,&quot; Cherny <a href="https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179838864666847">explained</a>. &quot;It&#x27;s the best coding model I&#x27;ve ever used, and even though it&#x27;s bigger &amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it&#x27;s better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end.&quot;</p><p>For enterprise technology leaders, this is a critical insight. The bottleneck in modern AI development isn&#x27;t the generation speed of the token; it is the human time spent correcting the AI&#x27;s mistakes. Cherny&#x27;s workflow suggests that paying the &quot;compute tax&quot; for a smarter model upfront eliminates the &quot;correction tax&quot; later.</p><h2><b>One shared file turns every AI mistake into a permanent lesson</b></h2><p>Cherny also detailed how his team solves the problem of AI amnesia. Standard large language models do not &quot;remember&quot; a company&#x27;s specific coding style or architectural decisions from one session to the next.</p><p>To address this, Cherny&#x27;s team maintains a single file named <a href="https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179842928947333">CLAUDE.md</a> in their git repository. &quot;Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time,&quot; he wrote.</p><p>This practice transforms the codebase into a self-correcting organism. When a human developer reviews a pull request and spots an error, they don&#x27;t just fix the code; they tag the AI to update its own instructions. &quot;<a href="https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2007347705945944153">Every mistake becomes a rule</a>,&quot; noted <a href="https://x.com/aakashgupta">Aakash Gupta</a>, a product leader analyzing the thread. The longer the team works together, the smarter the agent becomes.</p><h2><b>Slash commands and subagents automate the most tedious parts of development</b></h2><p>The &quot;vanilla&quot; workflow one observer praised is powered by rigorous automation of repetitive tasks. Cherny uses slash commands — custom shortcuts checked into the project&#x27;s repository — to handle complex operations with a single keystroke.</p><p>He highlighted a command called <i><b>/commit-push-pr</b></i>, which he invokes dozens of times daily. Instead of manually typing git commands, writing a commit message, and opening a pull request, the agent handles the bureaucracy of version control autonomously.</p><p>Cherny also deploys subagents — specialized AI personas — to handle specific phases of the development lifecycle. He uses a code-simplifier to clean up architecture after the main work is done and a verify-app agent to run end-to-end tests before anything ships.</p><h2><b>Why verification loops are the real unlock for AI-generated code</b></h2><p>If there is a single reason Claude Code has reportedly hit <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone">$1 billion in annual recurring revenue</a> so quickly, it is likely the verification loop. The AI is not just a text generator; it is a tester.</p><p>&quot;Claude tests every single change I land to claude.ai/code using the Claude Chrome extension,&quot; Cherny wrote. &quot;It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works and the UX feels good.&quot;</p><p>He argues that giving the AI a way to verify its own work — whether through browser automation, running bash commands, or executing test suites — improves the quality of the final result by &quot;2-3x.&quot; The agent doesn&#x27;t just write code; it proves the code works.</p><h2><b>What Cherny&#x27;s workflow signals about the future of software engineering</b></h2><p>The reaction to Cherny&#x27;s thread suggests a pivotal shift in how developers think about their craft. For years, &quot;AI coding&quot; meant an autocomplete function in a text editor — a faster way to type. Cherny has demonstrated that it can now function as an operating system for labor itself.</p><p>&quot;Read this if you&#x27;re already an engineer... and want more power,&quot; <a href="https://x.com/jefftangx/status/2008246873275215890">Jeff Tang</a> summarized on X.</p><p>The tools to multiply human output by a factor of five are already here. They require only a willingness to stop thinking of AI as an assistant and start treating it as a workforce.</p>

    <div><div><p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) rallied to $69,482 on Friday, and the rally coincided with data showing steady accumulation from smaller-sized holders in February.  </p><p>Analysts say the breakout may evolve into a broader bullish trend, although other data suggests that a longer period of price consolidation will underlie the emerging bull trend.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><p>BTC broke above the $69,000 resistance and its descending channel, triggering $92 million in short liquidations within four hours.</p></li><li><p>Small wallets added $613 million in February, while the whale wallets stalled with $4.5 billion in outflows.</p></li><li><p>Short-term holder profit-ratio indicator hit its lowest level since November 2022, underscoring weak sentiment over the past few weeks. </p></li></ul><h2>Will the Bitcoin relief rally last?</h2><p>Bitcoin has pushed above the upper boundary of its descending channel and retested $69,000. The move marks a potential bullish break of structure (BOS), if BTC holds above $68,000.</p><figure>    <img alt="Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Price, Bitcoin Analysis, Markets, Cryptocurrency Exchange, Price Analysis, Market Analysis, Liquidity, Whale" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57c8-adae-7196-97c0-6afdb745d174.png" /><figcaption><em>Bitcoin one-hour chart.

The 50- and 100-period exponential moving averages (EMAs) are now compressing beneath the price on the one-hour chart, reinforcing the possibility of the short-term momentum continuing.</p><p>The latest price surge <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/liquidations" target="_blank">triggered</a> about $96 million in futures liquidations over the past four hours, with nearly $92 million coming from short positions, signaling a short squeeze on bearish traders.</p><p>BTC liquidations were primarily concentrated on Bybit (22.5%), Hyperliquid (22%) and Gate (15%), suggesting these platforms account for a significant share of active leveraged positioning in the market.</p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/multi-day-negative-bitcoin-funding-signals-overcrowded-short-trade-time-for-a-reversal" target="_self"><em><strong>Related: Multi-day negative Bitcoin funding signals ‘overcrowded’ short trade: Reversal coming?</strong></em></a></p><h2>BTC retail investor demand backs the breakout</h2><p>The breakout is supported by the steady buying from the smaller-sized investors. Order flow data from <a href="https://hyblockcapital.com/" target="_blank">Hyblock</a> shows that the small wallets ($0–$10,000) have accumulated about $613 million in cumulative volume delta (CVD) in February, consistently bidding during the price correction.</p><p>The mid-sized wallets ($10,000–$100,000) remain about -$216 million for the month, but the cohort added about $300 million since BTC fell below $60,000, suggesting selective accumulation during discounted periods. </p><figure>    <img alt="Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Price, Bitcoin Analysis, Markets, Cryptocurrency Exchange, Price Analysis, Market Analysis, Liquidity, Whale" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57ce-856a-7d02-9328-d07adcaa1a67.png" /><figcaption><em>Bitcoin CVD data across different wallet sizes. Source: Hyblock Capital</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whale wallets ($100,000 and above) saw their CVD bottom near -$5.8 billion earlier in February and have since moved sideways. This stabilization implies that the aggressive distribution has paused, though a clear accumulation trend from the large holders has yet to emerge.</p><p>For the rally to continue, whale buying may need to return, and the short-term holder <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/analytics/query/6971d42da662164c84864f2b?v=6971d447a662164c84864f2d" target="_blank">spent output profit ratio (SOPR)</a> may need to move back above 1, signaling that the recent buyers are no longer selling at a loss.  </p><p>Notably, the short-term holder SOPR recently fell to its lowest level since November 2022, indicating that many recent buyers have been realizing losses, a sign that conviction may remain fragile despite the rebound.</p><figure>    <img alt="Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Price, Bitcoin Analysis, Markets, Cryptocurrency Exchange, Price Analysis, Market Analysis, Liquidity, Whale" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57cd-fdca-752b-ac7e-fb071f424299.png" /><figcaption><em>Bitcoin short-term holder SOPR.

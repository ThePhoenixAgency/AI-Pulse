                    <p>Apple is reportedly devoting <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios-27">iOS 27</a> development time to revamp older parts of the iPhone operating system, aiming to increase battery life by improving performance.
</p><p>It's already <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/21/despite-apple-having-said-otherwise-siri-may-become-a-chatbot-in-ios-27">been claimed</a> that iOS 27 will concentrate on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-intelligence">Apple Intelligence</a>, but also that Apple's internal code names for the work have <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/25/apples-unusual-os-27-code-name-shift-could-reflect-ai-strategy-changes">recently changed</a>. Now <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">says that</a> a major focus for the operating system update will be about reworking existing elements.
</p><p>Specifically, Apple is said to be rewriting parts of iOS for the new update. it's also removing long-standing code elements that have been superseded, and it's also planning to improve the performance of some apps.
</p><p>It's not known what features are being rewritten, nor which elements are being removed. It's also not clear whether the improvement to apps will be directly because of this iOS reworking, or if Apple is also updating the likes of Pages or <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/safari">Safari</a>.
</p><p>All of this work, though, should improve the performance of iOS 27. It's also all being done with the aim of using the better performance to mean reducing the use of battery power.
</p><p>Consequently, upgrading to iOS 27 when it is officially released around September 2026, should result in increased battery life for all iPhones —  assuming the report is accurate.
</p><p>Separately, the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-18">iPhone 18 Pro Max</a> is expected to have <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/06/iphone-18-pro-max-battery-life-to-increase-again----but-not-by-much">longer battery life</a> anyway. It's also been predicted that the expected <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-fold">iPhone Fold</a> will feature the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/02/just-about-every-spec-of-the-iphone-fold-may-have-just-been-leaked">largest-capacity battery</a> ever in an iPhone.
</p><p>In both cases, though, it's also been noted that the actual battery life differences will also depend on the power/performance capabilities of the forthcoming A20 processor.</p>

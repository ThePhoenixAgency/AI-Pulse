    <div><article> <a href="https://www.warp.dev/?utm_source=its_foss&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=linux_launch" target="_blank"><img src="https://itsfoss.com/assets/images/warp.webp" alt="Warp Terminal"></a> <p>Age verification online <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally?ref=itsfoss.com">is regrettably becoming the norm</a>. Platforms are increasingly asking users to prove their age before accessing certain content or services. That usually means handing over personal data, sometimes even biometric data, to a third-party provider, <strong>then hoping they do not sell it, suffer a breach</strong>, <em>or both</em>.</p><p>Now, the U.S. state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado?ref=itsfoss.com">Colorado</a> is mulling over a bill to implement age reporting for installing apps on computers and mobile devices.</p><h2>Age Attestation, What?</h2><figure><img src="https://itsfoss.com/content/images/2026/02/colorado-age-attestation-bill-summary.png" alt="Bill Summary: The bill requires an operating system provider to: Provide an accessible interface at account setup that requires an account holder to indicate the birth date or age of the user of that device to provide a signal regarding the user's age bracket (age signal) to applications available in a covered application store; Provide an application developer (developer) that requests an age signal, with respect to a particular user, the technical ability to call an age signal via a reasonably consistent real-time application programming interface that identifies, at a minimum, the user's age-bracket data; and Send only the minimum amount of information necessary to comply with the bill. An operating system provider shall not share an age signal with a third party for a purpose not required by the bill. The bill requires a developer to request an age signal with respect to a particular user from an operating system provider or a covered application store when the developer's application is downloaded and launched. A developer that receives an age signal is deemed to have knowledge of the age range of the user to whom that age signal pertains across all platforms of the application and points of access of the application. However, if a developer has clear and convincing information that a user's age is different than the age indicated by an age signal, the developer shall use that information as the primary indicator of the user's age range. A developer shall not: Request more information from an operating system provider or a covered application store than is necessary to comply with the bill; or Share an age signal with a third party for a purpose not required by the bill. A person that violates the bill must pay a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 for each minor affected by each negligent violation or not more than $7,500 for each minor affected by each intentional violation. The penalty is assessed and recovered in a civil action brought by the attorney general."></figure><p>Senator <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/legislators/matt-ball?ref=itsfoss.com">Matt Ball</a> and Representative <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/legislators/amy-paschal?ref=itsfoss.com">Amy Paschal</a> presented this bill, <strong><em>Age Attestation on Computing Devices</em></strong> (<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/SB26-051?ref=itsfoss.com">SB26-051</a>), to the Colorado Senate, where it was assigned to the <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/committees/2026A/senate/BusinessLaborTechnology?ref=itsfoss.com">Business, Labor, and Technology Committee</a>.</p><p>Currently <strong>only a proposal</strong>, the bill calls for operating system providers like Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Canonical to present an interface during device account setup that asks the account holder (<em>a person in Colorado</em>) to specify the birth date/age of the device's user.</p><p>That age data is then translated into an "<em>age signal</em>," which apps can call on via an API when a user downloads or launches them. The bill claims that this refers to non-personally identifiable data taken from a user's birth date or age.</p><p>The age signal <strong>does not hand over a specific birthdate to developers</strong>. It works in four age ranges — under 13, 13 to under 16, 16 to under 18, and 18 and above. </p><p>The bill also explicitly states that only the minimum amount of information necessary should be shared. Neither the OS provider nor developers are allowed to pass the age signal to third parties for purposes outside of what the bill requires.</p><p>On paper, <strong>the fines for violations sound like a serious deterrent</strong>. Up to $2,500 per minor affected for a negligent violation and up to $7,500 per minor for an intentional one. For a platform with millions of minor users, those numbers could stack up fast.</p><p>But the penalty is only triggered if the state <a href="https://coag.gov/?ref=itsfoss.com">Attorney General</a> chooses to bring a civil action, which means enforcement is entirely dependent on the political will of whoever holds that office at a given time.</p><p>Given the <a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/bash-manual-in-epstein-files/">sad state of things</a> currently, where minors' rights are violated routinely without any accountability or real punishment, these fines sound more like a slap on the wrist than a genuine consequence.</p><div><p></p><p>It is also unclear how this rule will apply to operating systems that do not need an online account.</p></div><h2>The Flaws</h2><p>The most immediate problem with SB26-051 is that <strong>it never specifies how age is actually determined</strong>. The bill says account holders must "<em>indicate</em>" the birth date or age of the user.</p><p>That's it; no verification mechanism, no ID check, or anything else is mentioned. Any so-called "<em>account holder</em>" could just straight up lie, and the system would take it as is.</p><p>I understand the need for the moderation of what applications minors install and use. But such legislation can't be a substitute for parental oversight, and when such a thing is imposed, it usually ends up being both ineffective and overreaching.</p><p><strong>Personally</strong>, I still think parents' or guardians' oversight (<em>provided it is grounded</em>) of what their children consume is the single most important thing that can prevent harmful content from influencing these young minds.</p><p>If passed, <strong>the bill would take effect on January 1, 2028</strong>. That said, if a <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/referendumPetitions.html?ref=itsfoss.com">referendum petition</a> is filed against it within ninety days of the <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/?ref=itsfoss.com">General Assembly</a> adjourning, it would go to Colorado voters in November 2026 to decide its fate.</p> </article><div> <p><span>About the author</span></p><div> <a href="https://itsfoss.com/author/sourav/"> <figure> <img src="https://itsfoss.com/content/images/size/w100/2026/01/2025-pfp-1-1.jpg" alt="Sourav Rudra"> </figure> </a> <div> <h2><a href="https://itsfoss.com/author/sourav/">Sourav Rudra</a></h2> <p>A nerd with a passion for open source software, custom PC builds, motorsports, and exploring the endless possibilities of this world.</p> </div>

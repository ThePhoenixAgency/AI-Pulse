    <div><div> <p>Taking some of the elements of survivor-likes and putting them into a tactical racing game, Backseat Champions has a really fun idea with a demo out now.</p>
<p>Most racing games either get you behind the wheel, or make you some sort of team manager but Backseat Champions is different. It acts like an auto-battler with the upgrade system popularised by the likes of Vampire Survivors (and all the others), with you picking from various cards. Here the AI races for you, but you're in charge of <em>how</em> they progress through each race based on the upgrades you pick.</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12878969511770816275gol2.webp"></p>
<p>The idea is interesting and it's like nothing else I've played. The UI certainly needs some work, but I really like the actual mechanics behind it. Keeping you on the edge of your seat as your AI driver takes corners, and attempts to overtake other cars while XP builds up towards you selecting the next upgrade.</p>
<p>You can pick various different types of upgrades like sharper corners, drag reduction, overall power boosts, improved tyres and much <em>much</em> more. You also have to keep an eye on the weather for your current tyres type and for general tyre wear, as you're in charge of when to send your driver into the pits to get sorted. Some upgrades might make you really fast, but spin out on certain corners - so it's a balancing act on what you pick.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-burst races</strong>, allowing you to quickly hop in and get straight to the action.</li>
<li><strong>Every race is unique.</strong> Experience different race lengths, dynamic weather conditions and random upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>All racing is real - nothing is scripted.</strong> The drivers are powered by machine learning. Naturally observe the craziest of overtakes and the hardest of crashes.</li>
<li><strong>Play with or against your friends.</strong> Battle it out or compete in the Career Mode championships together.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade your car.</strong> During the race, select random upgrades, unlock bonuses and build the fastest car to win each race.</li>
<li><strong>Plan strategic pit stops.</strong> Manage your pit stops and utilize many different tire compounds to optimize your race.</li>
<li><strong>Manage your boost.</strong> Manipulate your car by using boosts and aerodynamics buffs. Assist your driver with overtakes, defending and by setting overall faster lap times.</li>
<li><strong>Navigate the weather.</strong> Experience dynamic weather changes throughout the race. Will it stay dry, or risk making a pit stop for wet tires?</li>
<li><strong>Start your Career Mode.</strong> Unlock championships by winning in others. Climb your way through the ladder and become the best ever Backseat Champion!</li>
<li><strong>Unlock teams and customizations.</strong> Level up throughout your racing adventure. Unlock car customization features such as wheel rims, helmet designs, teams to choose from and more!</li>
<li><strong>Your choices matter.</strong> Everyone starts on equal footing. Infinite possibilities. Where will you make the difference?</li>
<li><strong>Race unique cars.</strong> From all kinds of Formula cars, to GT's, and all the way to modern Endurance cars. Face new challenges in different race dynamics.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer notes it uses non-generative neural network models to train the drivers, so it's <em>not</em> generative AI (since AI has become a bit of a dirty word) they don't want people to end up putting it in that box. All of it is using data from the developer, nothing third-party for it.</p>
<p>Very clever idea, keen to see where they take it for the eventual full release.</p>
<p>Try out the demo on Steam now.</p>

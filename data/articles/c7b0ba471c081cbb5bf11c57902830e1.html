Thick black smoke rises into the sky.</p></div><div><p>Dubai authorities said that four people were injured in a blaze at a building in the Palm Jumeirah area, and that the fire was brought under control. The statement did not go into further detail on the incident.</p></div><div><p>Elsewhere in the region, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan and Kuwait - all home to US military bases - said they had intercepted missiles fired towards them.</p></div><div><p>Huge plumes of black smoke were seen rising from an area near the headquarters of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet in Manama, Bahrain.

It is the home port for ships including anti-mine vessels and logistical support ships, though it is unclear if any were present. </p></div><div><p>Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement it was targeting US bases and assets as part of operation "Truthful Promise 4", in retaliation for the attack on Iran launched by the US and Israel on Saturday morning. </p></div><div><p>That attack - launched at approximately 09:30 Tehran time (06:00 GMT) - has so far targeted areas linked to the Iranian leadership, with US President Donald Trump encouraging the Iranian people to rise up against the regime. </p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2926/live/4a328420-14a5-11f1-9120-a910fc22c6ac.png.webp" alt="A regional map highlighting Iran in white with its name in black.

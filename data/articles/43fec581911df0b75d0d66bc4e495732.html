<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max">HBO Max</a> has released the first trailer for <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/house-of-the-dragon-season-3"><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 3</a>. Following its worldwide premiere today (Thursday, February 19), we've got a much better idea of what's likely to happen in the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/game-of-thrones"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> prequel show's next entry.</p>

</div> <p>Now that it's out in the wild, we'll be breaking down the first teaser for <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>'s third season. So, grab some snacks, mount your dragon, and let's see what it tells us about the forthcoming chapter.</p>

<p>But enough moaning! What does the teaser actually, well, tease? One of the biggest early talking points concerns The Battle of the Gullet.</p><p>Now, I'm not going to spoil what happens during this infamous fight that's contested in the air and on the waves. However, there are numerous clips in the trailer that look like they're taken from this deadly clash, which was reportedly supposed to bookend last season. Let's hope that it kicks off this season instead and gives us an epic battle that'll dominate the news cycle once season 3 has premiered.</p>

<p>I guess the biggest disappointment from this teaser is that we <em>still</em> don't know exactly when <em>House of the Dragon 3</em> will premiere.</p><p>Sure, it'll premiere this June, but an official launch date would've been a nice way to close out the trailer. *sigh*</p>

<a></a></p><h2>House of the Dragon fans call for something, anything to happen in season 3</h2> <p>Based on a wider variety of comments and opinions I've seen online, fans just want <em>something</em> to happen from the get-go in this season's opening episode.</p><p>Indeed, whether it's in threads on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/1r870d3/new_official_season_3_poster_for_house_of_the/" target="_blank">r/gameofthrones</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseOfTheDragon/comments/1r86vih/new_poster_for_house_of_the_dragon_season_3/" target="_blank">r/houseofthedragon</a>, forums including ResetEra, and/or social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X/Twitter, people don't want season 3 to tread water like its predecessor did. Let's hope its first teaser proves that it won't.</p>

<p>Like art imitating life, there's been something of a battle over the direction that HBO's <em>House of the Dragon</em> TV adaptation has gone in.</p><p>Indeed, in a September 2024 blog post that was quickly taken down, acclaimed author George R.R. Martin, who created the <em>Game of Thrones</em> franchise, criticized Ryan Condal for deviating from his source material. In response, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/house-of-the-dragon-showrunner-hits-back-at-george-r-r-martin-criticism-as-filming-begins-on-hit-hbo-tv-shows-third-season"><em>House of the Dragon</em>'s showrunner fired back during an interview last April</a>, with Condal saying Martin "just became unwilling to acknowledge the practical issues at hand in a reasonable way."</p><p>More recently, Martin described the pair's previously fruitful working relationship as "abysmal" and "worse than rocky" (per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/george-rr-martin-interview-thrones-winds-dragon-knight-1236473519/" target="_blank">The Hollwood Reporter</a>). The fallout has been so significant, in fact, that</p><p>HBO head Casey Bloys attempted to smooth things over a few weeks later, telling Deadline: "Like any good American family, I would prefer that our dysfunction stays behind closed doors. But here we are.</p><p>"What I would say is George introduced us to Ryan as the person that he thought would be the best to create <em>House the Dragon</em>," Bloys continued.<em> "</em>And, I will say Ryan has been an excellent showrunner and a really great partner and collaborator, so we embrace his vision and his creative choices, or we wouldn’t have done it."</p><p>All told, it seems like Martin's time serving as a major creative consultant on this series is over. We'll have to wait and see if Condal and company have made the right storytelling calls when season 3 arrives later this year.</p>

<a></a></p><h2>Season 3 will be 'huge', according to one of its main stars</h2>

<p>Predictably, those involved in <em>House of the Dragon </em>are going to talk it up to generate excitement among viewers.</p><p>Still, when my <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/house-of-the-dragon-season-3-will-be-huge-says-star-and-i-want-that-to-mean-good-news-for-one-major-storyline">colleague Jasmine Valentine asked Olivia Cooke</a>, who plays Alicent Hightower, to describe the upcoming season in one word, "huge" was the descriptor that Cooke used over and again.</p><p><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2 drew criticism for its creative deviations from the source material (more on this in the next post...). Despite showrunner Ryan Condal telling me ahead of last season's release that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/its-not-just-big-dragon-events-why-house-of-the-dragon-season-2-wont-be-full-of-action-according-to-its-co-creator">season 2 was "not just big dragon events"</a>, it also lacked the large-scale spectacle that many expected. if nothing else, let's hope that the latter is rectified in its follow-up season, with big and bloody battles aplenty.</p>

<a></a></p><h2>Which actors have joined the cast for House of the Dragon season 3?</h2>

</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: HBO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of its cast, there are plenty of newcomers you need to know about heading into the <em>Thrones </em>spin-off's next installment.</p><p>Among that number is Ormund Hightower (pictured above), who'll be played by <em>Grantchester</em> and <em>The Nevers</em> alumnus James Norton. The figurehead of House Hightower and fist cousin of deposed Westerosi Queen Alicent, he'll have a big part to play in House of the Dragon's next installment.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of the other confirmed new characters you'll see — and the actors who'll play them — this season:</p>
<ul><li>Tommy Flanagan (<em>Sons of Anarchy</em>)&nbsp;as Roderick Dustin</li><li>Dan Fogler (<em>Fantastic Beasts</em>)&nbsp;as Torrhen Manderly</li><li>Tom Cullen (<em>Downton Abbey</em>)&nbsp;as Luthor Largent</li><li>Joplin Sibtain (<em>Star Wars: Andor</em>)&nbsp;as Jon Roxton</li><li>Barry Sloane (<em>The Sandman</em>)&nbsp;as Adrian Redfort</li><li>Annie Shapero (<em>Red Skies</em>) as Alysanne Blackwood</li></ul>

<p>I'm back, fully recharged, and ready for the main event, which — at the time of writing — is less than two and a half hours away now.</p><p>Before it arrives, remind yourself what happened in last season's finale by reading my <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-ending-explained"><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2 ending explained</a> piece.

<p>Alright, I'm taking a quick break to refuel ahead of the trailer's worldwide debut later today.</p><p>While I'm away, why not read up on <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/house-of-the-dragon-season-3-hub">everything we know so far about House of the Dragon season 3</a>? It's a good read, but then I'm biased, aren't I... anyway, see you shortly!</p>

</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: HBO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 3 won't be its final installment, either. That's because <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/three-of-2025s-best-new-hbo-max-shows-just-got-renewed-for-season-2-but-only-one-has-a-perfect-rotten-tomatoes-score">HBO renewed both of its <em>Game of Thrones</em> prequel series for another season last November</a>.</p><p>We also know that the show's fourth chapter will be its last. Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> in January, HBO boss Casey Bloys said of <em>House of the Dragon </em>ending after four seasons: "Yes, that is the idea. The idea has always been to follow the history of the Targaryens. If you know the books, you know how the Targaryens end up. So there is a natural end to this particular history of that House of the Targaryens."</p>

<p>But enough waffling. Trailer launch aside, you'll want to know when <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 3 will be released on many of the world's <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare">best streaming services</a>.</p><p>Right now, an official release date hasn't been made public. However, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/streaming/hbo-max/we-march-now-towards-our-annihilation-house-of-dragon-season-3-update-sparks-game-of-thrones-fan-excitement-over-possible-launch-date-and-trailer-reveals">HBO has confirmed <em>House of the Dragon</em> 3's launch month</a>, with the high fantasy show set to return to our screens in <strong>June 2026</strong>. Start clearing your mid-2026 schedule, then, to make room for its likely weekly episodic drops.</p>

<p>I'll level with you, dear reader: I didn't expect to see House of the Dragon's latest trailer until season 1 of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms"><em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em></a> (<em>AKotSK</em>) — for those wondering, that's the second <em>Thrones</em> prequel series to be released — had ended. Depending on where you live, its finale isn't out until February 22/23.</p><p>Color me as surprised as Corlys Velaryon looks above, then, that <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 3's inaugural teaser will be with us TODAY. After all, wouldn't it have made sense to let the dust settle on <em>AKotSK</em>'s debut season first?</p><p>I'm not complaining by any means, by the way, more so just curious about the timing of the trailer's eventual release.</p>

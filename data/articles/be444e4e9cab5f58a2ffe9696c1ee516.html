While Nvidia is a diversified business, its bread and butter is designing <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/gpu-stocks/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=f749ef69-c428-47e1-825a-3d3c8e27feb1" target="_blank">graphics processing units</a> (GPUs) -- the hardware that provides the key computing power required to develop and deploy AI models.</p>   <p>Over the last few years, hyperscalers like <strong>Meta Platforms</strong>, <strong>Alphabet</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Amazon</strong>, and OpenAI have collectively spent hundreds of billions of dollars procuring GPUs from Nvidia. As companies accelerate the pace at which they invest in AI, the data workloads involved are scaling at an unprecedented rate.</p>      <p>This is leading to capacity constraints -- and as demand for additional cloud infrastructure is on the rise, demand for GPUs and other AI processors is outpacing supply. But as the data center buildout continues, another big bottleneck is forming in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market.</p>   <p>Big tech is no longer solely focused on securing as many GPUs as possible. Increasing shares of infrastructure budgets are now flowing toward another pocket of the AI chip value chain: dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and NAND solutions. This is where Sandisk enters the picture.</p>   <p>Next-generation products in agentic AI, autonomous systems, and robotics are far more complex than chatbots. These systems must process massive volumes of data, which means they need rapid access to that data from storage in close proximity to the processors. So as AI workloads expand, servers with more robust memory and storage solutions are becoming mission-critical necessities. For this reason, capital expenditures are swiftly rotating toward solid state drives, DRAM, and NAND flash storage -- precisely what Sandisk offers.</p>          <p>As of this writing (Feb. 11), Sandisk stock is hovering right around $600 per share. Given the price tag, you might think you've missed out on the opportunity to invest in it profitably. However, share price alone doesn't reveal much about a company's underlying valuation.</p>  </div></div> <span> </span>  </article>      <section><header> </header>  <div><ul> <p>Weʼre unable to load stories right now.</p>  </ul></div> </section></div></div>

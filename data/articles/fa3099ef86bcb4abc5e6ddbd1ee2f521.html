He was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/02/25/ethereum-foundation-s-aya-miyaguchi-leaving-executive-director-role">brought aboard following the transition of long-time</a> executive director Aya Miyaguchi into a new leadership position amid mounting community criticism that the foundation wasn’t doing enough to aggressively push the Ethereum ecosystem forward.</p><p>At the time, detractors pointed to a perceived disconnect between the EF and developers, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/02/ethereum-researchers-relinquish-eigenlayer-roles-over-conflict-of-interest-concerns">including conflicts of interests</a>, clashes over strategic direction and frustrations about ETH’s price performance. Such criticisms helped spur a broader leadership restructuring.</p><p>While Stańczak stressed his confidence in the team’s ability to carry forward the EF’s mission, he also signaled his intention to remain involved in the ecosystem.</p><p>“I plan to continue working directly with founders in frontier tech and Ethereum. I want to see and support the realization of the vision that I have talked about over the last years. It is one of the most exciting times to be a builder on Ethereum,” Stańczak wrote.</p><p><strong><em>Read more: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/02/25/ethereum-foundation-s-aya-miyaguchi-leaving-executive-director-role">Ethereum Foundation’s Aya Miyaguchi Leaving Executive Director Role</a></em></strong></p></div><div><p><span>AI Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethics">our standards</a>. <span>For more information, see </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2023/04/14/how-coindesk-will-use-generative-ai-tools">CoinDesk's full AI Policy</a>.</p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>AI-powered agents dominate the EasyA x Consensus Hong Kong hackathon</p><div><p>Feb 12, 2026</p></div><p><img alt="(Photo: Olivier Acuna/Modified by Coindesk)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2Ff9acfe24d2f46c1c3387b42f43dc8d8fefefad37-1920x1080.jpg%3Fauto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" /></p><p>Winning projects like FoundrAI demonstrate how generative AI is allowing developers to build market-ready products in just 48 hours.</p><div><p>What to know: </p><div><ul><li>At the EasyA x Consensus Hong Kong 2026 hackathon, nearly 1,000 developers shifted focus from back-end infrastructure to user-facing applications, underscoring what organizers called the "Year of the Application Layer."</li><li>Winning projects emphasized automation, security and risk management, with tools like FoundrAI's autonomous "startup in a box," SentinelFi's real-time scam detection and PumpStop's non-custodial, risk-focused trading layer.</li><li>The hackathon's growing prominence on the main show floor and the emphasis on seamless UX, including passkey logins, reflect a broader industry push to attract the next wave of retail users despite a weak macro environment.</li></ul></div></div><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2026/02/12/ai-powered-agents-dominate-the-easya-x-consensus-hong-kong-hackathon">Read full story</a></p></div></div></div>

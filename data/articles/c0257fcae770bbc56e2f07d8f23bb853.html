    <div><div>   <p>​Trip.com Group Limited (NASDAQ:<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TCOM">TCOM</a>) is one of the <a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-high-growth-international-stocks-to-buy-now-1692735/" target="_blank"><strong>High Growth International Stocks to Buy Now</strong></a>. On January 27, Joyce Ju from Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating on the stock but lowered the price target from $85 to $78. The price target adjustment comes ahead of the fiscal Q4 2025 earnings call, scheduled on February 26.</p>      <p>​While Joyce Ju maintains an overall positive outlook on Trip.com Group Limited (NASDAQ:TCOM), she believes the ongoing Anti-Monopoly investigation adds near-term uncertainty. As a result, she lowered the firm’s 2026-2027 non-GAAP net profit estimates from Trip.com by roughly 10% to 12%. Nevertheless, BofA maintained growth expectations for the company at 13% to 15% growth in 2026-2027. Ju expects the growth to be driven by robust Chinese travel demand and the company’s sustained leadership in the space.</p>   <figure><div> <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lT4sIYDFoJZZOtBb00E.AA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUzOA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/b87e36960d38ae25526d2a50e086212b" alt=""></p></div>  </figure>   <p>​That said, overall, Wall Street remains bullish on Trip.com Group Limited (NASDAQ:TCOM) with 92% of the 37% analysts covering the stock maintaining a Buy rating. In addition, analysts’ 12-month median price target reflects more than 50% upside from the current level.</p>   <p>​Trip.com Group Limited (NASDAQ:TCOM) operates as a leading global one-stop travel service provider, encompassing brands like Trip.com, Ctrip, Skyscanner, and Qunar.</p>      <p>While we acknowledge the potential of TCOM as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

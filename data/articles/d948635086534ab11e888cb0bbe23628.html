<p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/worlds-first-1040hz-and-6k-3d-odyssey-gaming-monitors-unveiled-by-samsung/">Samsung's Odyssey gaming monitors are quite popular</a> if you're willing to shell out a few hundred bucks for some top-of-the-line visual experiences. However, if your wallet is a bit light, then the right time to get these displays is when they're heavily discounted, like right now!</p>

<p>Two notable Samsung Odyssey monitors are currently on sale, both down to their lowest prices yet. They suit very different gaming audiences and budgets, but that also means that you can decide what works best for you in terms of value for money.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1771092527_818aiwccll._ac_sl1500_.webp"><img alt="Stock image for Samsung Odyssey G5 gaming monitor" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1771092527_818aiwccll._ac_sl1500__story.webp" /></a></figure>

                            
            <p>First up on offer is the Samsung Odyssey G5 (G50SF). This 27-inch monitor features a QD-OLED panel with a QHD resolution (2560x1440) with a refresh rate of 180Hz and a 0.03ms GTG response time, making it an excellent option for gaming. In addition, it sports OLED Safeguard that actively cools your screen to prevent burn-in. Another feature loved by many is the Glare-Free technology, which is 54% less glossy than traditional anti-reflection film.</p>

<p>Other notable specifications include support for HDR10, Free-Sync, and G-Sync. The display is also Pantone Validated, which means that it is capable of reproducing over 2100 colors and 110+ SkinTone shades from the Pantone library for a visually vibrant and color-accurate experience. The Samsung Odyssey G5 is currently selling at $349.99, which is massively reduced from its usual price of $549.99. You can grab it from the link at the end of the article.</p>

<p>The second gaming monitor, also from the Odyssey lineup, is the 57-inch Neo G9 (G95NC) curved display. This is geared more towards the hardcore gamer who prefers large, curved displays. Samsung touts the Neo G9 as the "world's-first Dual UHD monitor", which is a bit of confusing terminology that actually means that you'll be getting a single display that is as wide as 2 UHD panels. The overall display resolution of this 32:9, 1000R monitor is 7680x2160.</p>

<p>Alongside these mouth-watering specs, you'll get a 240Hz refresh rate and a 1ms GTG response time. It also supports DisplayPort 2.1 and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. In addition, Samsung's "revolutionary" Quantum Matrix technology with Quantum Mini LEDs ensures that you have complete control over brightness, along with improved contrast. This monster of a display typically sells at $2,299.99, but it is down to $1499.99 for a limited time only. Grab either monitor from the links below before the offer runs out!</p>

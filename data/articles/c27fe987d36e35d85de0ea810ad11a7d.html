						<p>After being an Epic Exclusive, the action-adventure Blades of Fire from MercurySteam and 505 Games is arriving on Steam on May 14th. It's not just jumping from one store to the other, it's also coming fresh with a whole lot of upgrades too.</p>
<p>From the press email: "Play as Aran de Lira, the last warrior able to forge true steel in a world where metal turns to stone. Survival depends on patience, understanding, and commitment to the weapons you choose to create. Combat is deliberate, weighty, and unforgiving. Weapons are forged with intent and permanently shaped by your choices. Progress comes from understanding your enemy and the blade you forged to face them. Designed for players who value atmosphere, challenge, and consequence over speed and spectacle."</p>

A video taken from a doorbell camera at Guthrie's residence has shown the man believed to have seized her. He wore a mask, gloves and backpack.</p></div><div><p>After conducting a forensic analysis of the video, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced last week that it believed the man was between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall, with an average build. </p></div><div><p>They have also said they believe the suspect bought the mask and backpack at a Walmart and are contacting stores to find a list of people who made the purchases.</p></div><div><figure><p></p><figcaption>'We will pay': Savannah Guthrie's new message about missing mother</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Officials have been reviewing surveillance footage from nearby Walmart locations, Nanos has said.</p></div><div><p>Investigators have also been testing a glove they found that seems to match the ones worn by the suspect. </p></div><div><p>They have created a DNA profile of an unknown male to put into a national FBI database, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. That database could show a match if the suspect had a previous arrest and gave law enforcement a DNA sample in the past. </p></div><div><p>On Sunday, Savannah Guthrie, the Today show co-host, issued another video appeal to "whoever has her, or knows where she is". She added that Nancy Guthrie's loved ones "still have hope".</p></div><div><p>In the two weeks since Guthrie's disappearance, the FBI and local police have conducted a massive search operation involving helicopters, sniffer dogs and hundreds of officers, while taking in thousands of call-in tips.</p></div><div><p>On Friday, authorities executed a search warrant at a residence two miles from Guthrie's home but made no arrests.</p></div><div><p>Investigators are now employing new strategies to try to trace Guthrie. They are using a device that could detect signals coming from her pacemaker, law enforcement sources told CBS. </p></div><div><p>The sources said the tool, called a "signal sniffer", was mounted on a helicopter to fly over an area where officials believe she might be, to track down her exact location. </p></div><div><p>Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when a family member dropped her off at her home following a get-together at her other daughter Annie Guthrie's house.</p></div><div><p>Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.</p></div></article></div></div>

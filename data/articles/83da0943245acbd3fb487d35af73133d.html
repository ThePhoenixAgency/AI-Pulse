    <div><div><p>A British minister has warned that the EU’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/12/eu-leaders-clash-buy-european-belgium-summit">“Made in Europe” industrial strategy</a> could hit supply chains, increase costs and create unnecessary trade barriers between the UK and some members of the bloc.</p><p>Nick Thomas-Symonds, the UK minister for EU relations, made the comments as the EU is preparing to publish new legislation that would require European-made products to be prioritised in public procurement and consumer schemes.</p><p>The proposed legislation is designed to reduce dependence on foreign imports and boost local production in strategic sectors in a uncertain geopolitical environment.</p><p>“My concern is that if you had very strict preference requirements, you would risk impacting our deeply integrated supply chains that would create unnecessary barriers to trade in key UK-EU industries and increase costs,” Thomas-Symonds said at an economic event in Madrid. “That would obviously affect UK-Spain supply chains.”</p><p>Thomas-Symonds argued that Britain and the EU were facing the same challenges of raising competitiveness and productivity.</p><p>He said: “The UK is the fourth largest investor in Spain. We are not going to meet those challenges by causing unnecessary economic damage to each other.”</p><figure><div><img alt="Nick Thomas-Symonds speaks at the Forum Europa debate in Madrid: he stands at a podium in front of microphones.

Such a move would be likely to face objections from opposition parties.</p><p>EU leaders agreed at a summit in Belgium earlier in February to move ahead with a “Buy European” policy, with the aim of securing the continent’s future amid geopolitical volatility.</p><p>The 27 member states have been looking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/11/the-guardian-view-on-a-made-in-europe-industrial-strategy-an-idea-whose-time-has-come">boost Europe’s competitiveness</a> compared with the US and China at a time of economic uncertainty, following the Trump’s administration’s tariff agenda and China’s export of heavily subsidised goods to the continent.</p><figure></figure><p>The draft “Made in Europe” plan includes the EU’s member states as well as members of the European Economic Area – Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein – but not Britain. The EU said, however, that other “trusted partners” could be added in future.</p><p>The “Buy European” programme has long been promoted by France, but has faced some criticism by member states including Italy and Germany – whose automakers have global manufacturing operations – who have expressed concerns that the rules could be too narrow.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission">European Commission</a> is due to publish its Industrial Accelerator Act later this month, which is expected to set targets for European content in a range of strategic products such as solar panels and electric vehicles.</p></div></div>

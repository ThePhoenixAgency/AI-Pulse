    <div><div><p>Demand for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) continued to grow over the past month, even as broader cryptocurrency markets faced heavy selling pressure, underscoring the sector’s resilience and growing institutional footprint.</p><p>The total value of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/rwa-token-market-bitcoin-adoption-2025">onchain RWAs</a> increased 13.5% over the past 30 days, according to data from RWA.xyz. The increase reflects both higher asset issuance, meaning more tokenized securities brought onto public blockchains, and growth in the number of unique wallet addresses holding these assets, signaling expanding participation.</p><p>As of Feb. 16, all major blockchain networks tracked by RWA.xyz recorded increases in tokenized asset value, led by Ethereum, with roughly $1.7 billion in net growth, followed by Arbitrum at $880 million and Solana at $530 million. The figures refer to the increase in total onchain value of tokenized assets issued or circulating on those networks.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c673c-2bc9-7df4-a089-6ac4f9453fbd.png"><figcaption><em>Excluding stablecoins, net growth in tokenized securities such as Treasurys, private credit and other yield-bearing instruments accelerated over the past 30 days.

Flows into these instruments continued during the period, while <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-stocks-rise-220-of-early-defi-boom">tokenized stocks</a> and exchange-traded products also posted gains.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-gold-drives-rwa-growth-2025"><em><strong>Tokenized gold accounts for 25% of RWA net growth in 2025 after 177% market-cap rise</strong></em></a></p><h2>A sharp contrast with the broader crypto market&nbsp;</h2><p>Steady demand for tokenized RWAs points to deeper institutional participation, as asset managers increasingly use public blockchains to issue and settle tokenized versions of traditional financial products. </p><p>Tokenized money market funds, for example, are <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-money-market-funds-vs-stablecoins-jpmorgan">evolving beyond simple yield vehicles</a> and are beginning to serve as collateral in certain trading and lending markets. Major institutions, including BlackRock, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have become active participants in the space.</p><p>BlackRock last week made its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-buidl-uniswap-institutional-defi-adoption" target="_self">first formal move into decentralized finance</a>, bringing its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) tokenized US Treasury fund to Uniswap.</p><p>The growth also stands in contrast to the broader cryptocurrency market, which has shed roughly $1 trillion in market value over the past month, highlighting the relative stability of yield-bearing tokenized assets.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c673c-2efa-773e-8647-333c7c97f714.png"><figcaption><em>The total crypto market has continued to unravel since October, with losses intensifying in January.

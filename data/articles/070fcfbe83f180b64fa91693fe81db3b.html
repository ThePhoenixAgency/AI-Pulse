<p><strong>Microsoft has warned users that threat actors are leveraging a new variant of the ClickFix technique to deliver malware.</strong>



</p><p>The <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/topics/clickfix/">ClickFix</a> attack method has been increasingly used in the past year by both cybercriminals and state-sponsored threat groups.



</p><p>The attack involves attackers displaying a fake error message on a compromised or malicious site. The message instructs the target to address the issue by pressing specific keys, then performing additional steps (eg, running a command). By following the attacker’s instructions, the user unknowingly grants elevated permissions, downloads malware, or executes attacker-supplied scripts.



</p><p>In a recent ClickFix attack observed by Microsoft the attacker asked targets to run a command that executes a custom DNS lookoup.

<p>“The initial command runs through cmd.exe and performs a DNS lookup against a hard-coded external DNS server, rather than the system’s default resolver. The output is filtered to extract the ‘Name:’ DNS response, which is executed as the second-stage payload,” Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/MsftSecIntel/status/2022456612120629742">explained</a>.



</p><p>This tactic enables the attacker to reach their infrastructure and validate execution of the second-stage payload, increasing their chances of evading detection by blending malicious traffic into regular network traffic. 



</p><p>The second-stage payload downloads and executes a malicious Python script designed for reconnaissance. The final payload is then dropped and a persistence mechanism is deployed.</p>



<p>The final payload is a remote access trojan named ModeloRAT, which enables attackers to collect information about the compromised system and execute other payloads.



</p><p>While Microsoft has not shared any information on the attacks, Huntress reported recently that a threat actor tracked as KongTuke had been deploying ModeloRAT through a ClickFix variant dubbed <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/malicious-chrome-extension-crashes-browser-in-clickfix-variant-crashfix/">CrashFix</a>. The campaign was aimed at corporate environments.

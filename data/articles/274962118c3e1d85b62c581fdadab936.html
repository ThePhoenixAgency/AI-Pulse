On February 10, 2026, Ares Management Corp (NYSE:ARES) CEO Michael Arougheti outlined the firm’s growth priorities at the Bank of America Financial Services Conference, highlighting record Q4 capital deployment of $46 billion, a 20% dividend increase, and assets under management rising to $600 billion in five years.</p>   <figure><div> <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0dr_A01l_LJRkhiVnUC99A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/2a9b6dbb719b10b0b945dbf930d80d29" alt="Ares Management Corp (ARES) Deepening Exposure to the AI Space"></p></div> <figcaption>Ares Management Corp (ARES) Deepening Exposure to the AI Space  </figcaption> </figure>   <p>He emphasized expansion in private credit, digital infrastructure, and real estate, alongside AI integration to boost efficiency, while setting ambitious targets of 16%–20% annual FRE growth and over 20% RI growth. With $150 billion in dry powder and a strong deal pipeline, Arougheti expressed confidence in capturing opportunities amid favorable market conditions.</p>      <p>On February 5, Ares Management Corp reported Q4 2025 EPS of $1.45 and revenue of $1.5 billion. These figures fell short of analyst forecasts for EPS of $1.70 and revenue of $1.52 billion.</p>   <p>The company reported strong growth in management fees, which jumped 27% YoY. It also crossed $100 billion in fundraising for the year, sending its assets under management above $600 billion. For 2026, Ares Management Corp expects its fundraising to match or exceed the 2025 level.</p>   <p>In light of this, Raymond James upgraded ARES stock to a Strong Buy from Market Perform on February 9. It set a $157 price target for the stock. The firm based the upgrade on Ares Management’s robust outlook, which shows the company’s fee-related earnings are expected to grow 16-20% through 2028.</p>      <p>According to Raymond James, Ares Management has a predictable growth considering that over $100 billion of its assets under management is not earning fees yet. The firm further noted that Ares Management’s 4.1% common dividend yield further supports the investment case for ARES stock.</p>   <p>Ares Management Corp (NYSE:ARES) is a global alternative investment manager with nearly $623 billion of assets under management. It operates in private equity, credit, and real-estate markets, and this allows it to offer clients a wide range of primary and secondary investment solutions.</p>   <p>While we acknowledge the potential of ARES as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

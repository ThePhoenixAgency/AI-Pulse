Disappointed bunch at the moment.”</p><p>Nissanka was involved in a 97-run stand off 66 balls with Kusal Mendis for the second wicket, with the wicketkeeper-batsman posting his third fifty in the competition.</p><p>Nissanka became the first Sri Lankan to score two hundreds in T20 internationals.</p><p>After Mendis’s dismissal, Nissanka and Pavan Rathnayake put on 76 off 34 balls to see Sri Lanka to victory.</p><p>Nissanka played some glorious cover drives off the spinners and played some elegant flicks against the quicks.</p><p>Rathnayake hit the winning runs straight after Nissanka reached his century off 52 balls and was greeted by massive cheers in Pallekele International Stadium.</p><p>The packed crowd roared again one delivery later when Rathnayake finished the match with a boundary to deep square.</p><p>Sri Lanka came into the World Cup after a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of England, but have gained momentum and have won all three games so far.</p><p>Australia’s campaign has been plagued by injuries.</p><p>Their captain Marsh, who missed the first two games, returned and gave them a rollicking start by scoring 54.</p><p>Marsh and Travis Head (56) scored 104 runs off 51 balls for the first wicket.</p><p>With Australia eyeing a total in excess of 200, Sri Lanka’s slow bowlers kept them to 181 with leg spinner Dushan Hemantha picking up 3-37.</p><p>Australia collapsed as they looked for quick runs, losing their last six wickets for 21 in 24 balls.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20260216__97R79M6__v1__MidRes__CricketIccMensT20Wc2026SriAus-1771263858.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80" alt="Australia's captain Mitchell Marsh looks on after his team's loss against Sri Lanka at the end of their 2026 ICC Men's T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match in the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Kandy on February 16, 2026.

England came back from 105-5 to post 202-7. Italy were cut short on 178.</p><p>In New Delhi, Afghanistan shrugged off back-to-back defeats to finally register a win after beating the United Arab Emirates by five wickets. That helped them stay in the tournament and saw South Africa secure a spot in the Super Eights.</p></div></div>

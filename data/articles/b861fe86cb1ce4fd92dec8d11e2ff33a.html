Giving folks a 5-day head start on President’s Day proper come Monday, Amazon has now flipped over to its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/presidentsdaysale?tag=toysj-20">annual sale</a>, featuring deals on Apple Watch, Beats headphones, even deeper discounts on Google Pixel 10 gear, a host of its in-house tech – Echo gear, Ring smart, Blink – and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/presidentsdaysale?tag=toysj-20">much more</a>.&nbsp;</p> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/09/Apple-Watch-series-11-launch-deals.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1400" alt=""></figure> <h2>Apple Watch Series 11 <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/apple-watch-series-11-deals-presidents-day/">price drops roll on at $100 off ahead of President’s Day, deals from $299</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/01/AirPods-Pro-3-deal.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Now live at Amazon again: <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/airpods-pro-3-presidents-day-deal/">AirPods Pro 3 drop to $210 in early President’s Day sales (within $11 of holiday low)</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/Apple-Pencil-Pro-iPad-mini-7.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1400" alt=""></figure> <h2>One of the best price ever on Apple Pencil Pro now live again at $70 (Up to 46% off, Best Buy open-box)</h2> <p>The particularly notable Best Buy open-box offer on <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/best-price-ever-apple-pencil-pro/">Apple Pencil Pro</a> is live again. The retailer is now offering “excellent” open-box units with a 1-year Apple warranty sitting <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/best-price-ever-apple-pencil-pro/">down at <strong>$69.99 shipped</strong></a> – one of the lowest prices we have ever tracked.</p>
<p>Best Buy now has “excellent” open-box <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/best-price-ever-apple-pencil-pro/">Apple Pencil Pro units selling at <strong>$69.99 shipped</strong></a>. That’s close to 46% off the $129 MSRP at Apple and the lowest price we can find from a reputable source with a 1-year Apple warranty attached.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Geek Squad Verified</li>
<li>Works and looks like new. Restored to factory settings.</li>
<li>Includes all parts and accessories. Packaging may vary or be absent.</li>
<li>1-year Apple warranty</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the same deal we featured recently, but it is now live once again to give iPad users a chance to score Apple’s latest and greatest Pencil at one of the best prices we have seen to date.</p>
<p>Apple Pencil Pro carries a $129 list price at Apple, but it more realistically sells for $99 on a regular basis and its <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/best-price-ever-apple-pencil-pro/">currently down at $95 via Amazon</a>. Deals on new condition units at retailers like Best Buy and Amazon have been very hard to come by beyond that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering $95 to $99 is essentially the price these things sell for at all times, there really hasn’t been a deal in a very long time – Apple Pencil Pro has sold for roughly $99 on Amazon since Black Friday 2024 outside of a very brief dip to $93. At this point it seems like we might never see a solid new condition deal until Apple decides it’s time for Apple Pencil Pro 2, and who knows when that might be.</p>
<p>Including the new M5 iPad Pro, Apple Pencil Pro is compatible with just about all relatively recent iPad releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPad Pro 13-inch (M4)</li>
<li>iPad Pro 11-inch (M4)</li>
<li>iPad Air 13-inch (M2 and M3)</li>
<li>iPad Air 11-inch (M2 and M3)</li>
<li>iPad mini (A17 Pro)</li>
</ul> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/03/M4-MacBook-Air-pre-order-deals-03.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1400" alt=""></figure> <h2>LAST DAY: <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/apple-32gb-m4-macbook-air-best-prices/">Apple’s 32GB M4 MacBook Air models hit some of the best prices ever at up to $300 off today</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/iPad-mini-A17-Pro-deals.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Latest iPad mini is $100 off ahead of President’s Day, deals from $399 (All colors/configs)</h2> <p>Much like we are seeing with the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/ipad-mini-deals-presidents-day/">Apple Watch Series 11 models at<strong> $100 off</strong></a> starting from <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/ipad-mini-deals-presidents-day/"><strong>$299</strong></a>, with the official launch of Amazon’s <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/ipad-mini-deals-presidents-day/">2026 President’s Day sale</a> the deals on the latest <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/ipad-mini-deals-presidents-day/">iPad mini 7</a> are now rolling on as well. While we did see some configurations jump back up in price recently, as of the time of writing all storage configs and colors are now once again <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/ipad-mini-deals-presidents-day/"><strong>$100 off </strong>at Amazon</a> with deals starting from <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/ipad-mini-deals-presidents-day/"><strong>$399</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>iPad mini President’s Day deals</h2>
<ul>
<li>iPad mini 128GB <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/ipad-mini-deals-presidents-day/"><strong>$399</strong> (Reg. $499)</a></li>
<li>iPad mini 256GB <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/ipad-mini-deals-presidents-day/"><strong>$499</strong> (Reg. $599)</a></li>
<li>iPad mini 512GB <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/ipad-mini-deals-presidents-day/"><strong>$699</strong> (Reg. $799)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Amazon is now offering a straight up $100 off all iPad mini configs. This includes all three storage options – 128GB, 256GB, and the 512GB – and all four colors of each.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the same deals we caught at Amazon nearer the top of the month, but after several of them jumped back up in price it appears Amazon has decided to keep the discounts rolling as part of its President’s Day event through Monday. It is unclear whether or not all of these offers will stay live that long, but appears as though they might, and they are live right now.</p>
<p>We have seen these configs at as much as $120 off a couple times and a one-day Cyber Monday offer at $150 off, but beyond that the offers we have today are on par with the Amazon lows.</p> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Apple-Terra-Cotta-Alpine-Loop.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Apple’s Terra Cotta orange <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/apple-terra-cotta-orange-alpine-loop-medium-deal/">Alpine Loop in size medium just hit one of its best prices ever</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/01/Apple-Trail-Loop-blue-2026.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Apple’s latest <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/apple-latest-blue-trail-loop-deals-2/">Blue Trail Loop is up to 30% off right now, Natural finish model at new all-time low</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Apple-Crossbody-Strap-black.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2><a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/apple-black-crossbody-strap-best-prices/">Apple’s black Crossbody Strap hits new Amazon all-time low at $35, more from $27 (Up to 54% off)</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/satechi-OntheGo-collection-with-new-hybrid-USB-C-lanyard-charging-data-cable.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Satechi’s crossbody <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/satechi-usbc-crossbody-cable-strap/">USB-C cable lanyard transfers data and carries your phone down at $24</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/Best-leather-iPad-case-Burton-Goods-deal.jpeg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2><a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/burton-goods-leather-ipad-pro-case-sale/">Gorgeous Burton Goods leather M4/M5 iPad Pro cases hit clearance pricing, now up to 47% off with this code</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/Anker-2025-Prime-25W-MagSafe-charging-gear.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1500" alt=""></figure> <h2>Anker’s impressive <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/anke-qi2-25w-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-lowest-price/">Qi2 25W 3-in-1 Prime MagSafe Charger w/ Smart Display hits all-time low at $100 off</a></h2> <h2>Anker’s white model <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/anker-white-smart-display-25w-magsafe-charger-hits-all-time-low/">25W Smart Display MagSafe charger hits all-time low today at $90 off,</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Sony-WH-1000XM6-earbuds-2026-launch-review-FI.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2><a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/12/wh1000xm6-earbuds-launch-sony-review/">Sony just launched its next-gen WF-1000XM6 wireless earbuds</a></h2> <p>The new Sony WF-1000XM6 wireless earbuds have arrived in two colorways, including Black and Platinum Silver <a href="https://howl.link/cnsloy6cnktns">carrying a <strong>$329.99</strong> list price</a>.

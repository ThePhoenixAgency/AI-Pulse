<p><a href="https://upscrolled.com/" target="_blank">UpScrolled</a>, a social network that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/upscrolleds-founder-says-the-social-network-has-zoomed-past-2-5m-users/">caught fire</a> after TikTok’s ownership change in the U.S., is facing a serious moderation problem. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/02/upscrolleds-founder-says-the-social-network-has-zoomed-past-2-5m-users/">growing to more than 2.5 million users</a> in January, users have reported the app is not taking action on the creation of usernames and hashtags that contain racial slurs, and hasn’t been able to properly moderate harmful content.</p>

<p>After receiving tips from UpScrolled users, TechCrunch confirmed the existence of a wide range of racial slurs and hate speech being used in people’s usernames on the app. For instance, some usernames would feature the name of the slur itself, the slur combined with other words, or multiple slurs in a single username; other usernames contain hate speech, like “Glory to Hitler.” </p>

<p>After reporting these slurs to UpScrolled’s public email address, we received a response from that email that the company is “actively reviewing and removing inappropriate content,” and is working to expand its moderation capacity. The email advised us not to engage with bad-faith actors while the situation is resolved.</p>

<p>Days after reporting this activity on the app, the accounts with slurs in the usernames that were provided to UpScrolled via screenshots remained online. </p>

<p>In addition, slurs and hate speech can be found elsewhere in the app, including hashtags and text used alongside its photo or video content, TechCrunch found. Other harmful content was available, including text posts with racial slurs and hate speech, and photo and video content glorifying Hitler, based on TechCrunch’s review of the app.</p>

<p>TechCrunch wasn’t alone in identifying this problem; the ADL also <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/article/upscrolled-social-media-platform-attracts-virulent-antisemites-lacks-enforcement" target="_blank">published a blog post this month</a>, noting that UpScrolled was becoming home to antisemitic and extremist content and <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations" target="_blank">designated</a> foreign terrorist organizations, like Hamas and others.</p>

<p>UpScrolled, which was founded in 2025, claims on its website claims that the platform offers every voice “equal power.” The app has seen more than 4 million downloads on iOS and Android since June 2025, according to market intelligence provider <a href="https://appfigures.com/" target="_blank">Appfigures</a> — a figure even higher than the startup’s self-reported number last month.</p>

<p>But while UpScrolled’s <a href="https://upscrolled.com/en/faq/" target="_blank">FAQ</a> explains the app doesn’t “censor opinions,” it does indicate that its <a href="https://upscrolled.com/en/rules-and-policies/" target="_blank">policy</a> is to restrict content that involves “illegal activity, hate speech, bullying, harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted material, or anything intended to cause harm.”</p>

<p>That guidance is similar to most modern-day social media platforms. It’s clear, however, that the company is struggling to enforce its rules.</p>

<p>It’s battle that social networks are often faced with — especially those that receive a large influx of new users in a short time period. Bluesky, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/bluesky-racial-slurs-banned-list-usernames/">faced issues with slurs in account usernames in July 2023</a>, which led to users threatening to leave the site.</p>

<p>After UpScrolled’s initial reply to our inquiry, TechCrunch also received a response from the press account on Tuesday, which directed us to UpScrolled founder <a href="https://x.com/iHijazi" target="_blank">Issam Hijazi’s</a> <a href="https://x.com/realUpScrolled/status/2021183174802280576" target="_blank">new video</a>, where he addressed the issues with content moderation.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/realUpScrolled/status/2021183174802280576" target="_blank">video</a>, he confirmed that users have been uploading “harmful content” that goes against UpScrolled’s terms of service and the company’s beliefs.</p>

<p>“We are offering everyone the freedom to express and share their opinions in a healthy and respectful digital environment,” Hijazi said. To create that environment, he said the company is “rapidly expanding our content moderation team, and we are upgrading our technology infrastructure so we can catch and remove harmful content more effectively.” </p>

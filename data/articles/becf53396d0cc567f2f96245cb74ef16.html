<p>Inertia Enterprises has raised $450 million to build one of the world’s most powerful lasers, which it hopes will serve as the foundation of a grid-scale power plant the fusion startup intends to start construction on in 2030. <a href="https://inertia.com/" target="_blank">Inertia Enterprises</a> is building on technology developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s National Ignition Facility (NIF). The NIF is the site of the world’s only controlled fusion reactions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/17/laser-powered-fusion-experiment-more-than-doubles-its-power-output/">that have reached scientific breakeven</a>, in which the reaction releases more energy than it took to start. </p>

<p>The Series A was led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from GV, Modern Capital, Threshold Ventures, and others. Inertia’s co-founders include Jeff Lawson, who co-founded Twilio and serves as its CEO; Annie Kritcher, who led the successful experiments at NIF; and Mike Dunne, a Stanford professor who helped Lawrence Livermore develop a power plant design based on NIF. Kritcher has remained in her position at Lawrence Livermore.</p>







<p>NIF’s breakeven experiments have been a key milestone on the road to widespread fusion power. However, considerable progress needs to be made before a fusion power plant can deliver electricity to the grid. For Inertia, that means building a laser capable of delivering 10 kilojoules 10 times per second.</p>

<p>The startup’s reactor relies on a form of fusion known as inertial confinement. In Inertia’s flavor of inertial confinement, lasers bombard a fuel target, compressing the fuel until atoms inside fuse and release energy. The technique is based on NIF’s designs, in which laser light is converted into X-rays inside the target. The X-rays are what ultimately heat and compress the fuel pellet.</p>

<p>Each of Inertia’s power plants will require 1,000 of its lasers bombarding 4.5 mm targets that cost less than $1 each to mass produce. By contrast, the NIF’s system uses 192 lasers to fire on <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/keys-to-success/targets" target="_blank">painstakingly crafted</a> targets that take dozens of hours to make. Inertia is betting that by using the same basic principles as NIF and applying a more commercial mindset, it can bring the costs down dramatically.</p>

<p>Inertia’s new round is the latest in a string of funding announcements from fusion startups in recent months. With this round and others, fusion startups have attracted more than $10 billion in investments. And at least a dozen companies have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/31/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/%5D/">raised more than $100 million</a>.</p>

<p>Last week, Avalanche said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/03/avalanche-thinks-the-fusion-power-industry-should-think-smaller/">raised $29 million to advance its desktop-sized fusion reactor</a>. Earlier this year, Type One Energy told TechCrunch it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/bill-gates-backed-type-one-energy-raises-87m-ahead-of-250m-series-b/">attracted $87 million in investment</a> in advance of a $250 million Series B that it’s currently raising. Last summer, Commonwealth Fusion Systems <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/">raised $863 million from dozens of investors</a>, including Google, Nvidia, and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.</p>

<p>Two fusion companies recently announced they were going public via reverse mergers. General Fusion said in January it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/22/struggling-fusion-power-company-general-fusion-to-go-public-via-1b-reverse-merger/">merge with acquisition company Spring Valley III</a> in a deal that values the combined company at $1 billion. General Fusion had previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/05/layoffs-hit-general-fusion-as-the-fusion-power-startup-runs-short-on-cash/">struggled</a> to raise money from private investors. Earlier last month, TAE Technologies announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/trump-media-is-merging-with-fusion-power-company-tae-technologies-in-6b-deal/">merge with Donald Trump’s social media company</a>, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group; the combined company would be worth $6 billion, according to the all-stock transaction.</p>

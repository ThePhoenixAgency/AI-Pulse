U.S. small-cap equities reported modest gains in the fourth quarter of 2025. The quarter started as a continuation of the post-Liberation Day risk-on market environment, while it ended on a strong note, driven by a positive macroeconomic backdrop. Attractive valuations, earnings recovery, broadening of the market, and a shift from mega-cap stocks supported small caps in the quarter. The Aristotle Small Cap Equity Fund (Class I-2) returned 1.96% in Q4 2025, trailing the 2.19% total return of the Russell 2000 Index. Security selection supported overall performance, while allocation effects detracted from performance.

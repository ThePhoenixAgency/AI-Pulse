    <pre><code>Key Insights (AI-assisted):
AT&amp;T’s move to sell an end-to-end IoT stack via AWS Marketplace signals a shift toward cloud-first, catalog-based IoT procurement.
It reduces integration friction between connectivity, sensors, and cloud analytics, making it easier for non-IT-heavy SMEs to adopt operational monitoring at scale.
By bundling security, device management, and dashboards, it pressures smaller IoT platform vendors and systems integrators that rely on bespoke projects.
This development illustrates how hyperscaler marketplaces are becoming primary go-to channels for packaged IoT solutions across verticals.
New collaboration simplifies IoT adoption for businesses with a secure, scalable, and easy-to-deploy solution The solution offers plug-and-play installation, secure cloud integration, and near real-time monitoring of environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, motion, and energy usage.
Businesses can scale easily, adding sensors as needed, with extended range and long battery life for reliable performance.
The AWS Marketplace listing streamlines procurement and accelerates time-to-value for industries such as retail, hospitality, healthcare, warehousing, and property management. AT&amp;T is proud to announce that its Connected Spaces solution is now available as our first end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT) offering listed on the AWS Marketplace, marking a significant milestone in simplifying smart business operations for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
AT&amp;T Connected Spaces is an innovative, plug-and-play IoT solution designed to help businesses monitor and manage their environments in near real-time. The solution combines pre-integrated wireless sensors and a secure cloud platform with intuitive dashboards to deliver actionable insights without requiring in-house IT expertise. Businesses can track critical metrics such as temperature, humidity, motion, energy usage, and security, enabling them to optimize resources, reduce downtime, and enhance customer experiences.
By joining AWS Marketplace, AT&amp;T is making it easier than ever for businesses to discover, purchase and deploy Connected Spaces through a trusted cloud commerce platform. This listing streamlines procurement, accelerates time-to-value, and provides a scalable, data-driven solution that can support a wide range of industries such as retail, hospitality, healthcare, warehousing, and property management.
Mike Van Horn, associate vice president, AT&amp;T Connected Solutions, said: “Connected Spaces is about giving businesses the tools to make smarter decisions, faster.” “Bringing our first end-to-end IoT solution on AWS Marketplace reinforces our commitment to innovation and accessibility for businesses of all sizes.”
Connected Spaces offers a range of features designed to simplify IoT adoption. Businesses benefit from easy installation with pre-staged sensors and dashboards, near real-time monitoring of environmental conditions, and customizable alerts when thresholds are exceeded. The solution is built for scalability, allowing organizations to add sensors as their needs evolve, and offers extended range and long battery life for reliable performance. With data encrypted end-to-end, businesses can trust that their information is protected.
“With Connected Spaces, we replaced assumption with facts. We gained clear insights on the usage of our grad lounge using the people-counting sensor as well as real-time alerts from the temperature sensors that helped prevent overheating our network closets—all in one simple solution,” said Tom Reichert, Ph.D., dean of the College of Information and Communications at the University of South Carolina.
This milestone underscores AT&amp;T’s leadership in IoT innovation and cloud integration, while highlighting the strength of its collaboration with AWS.
Together, the companies are delivering a seamless path to digital transformation for organizations seeking to harness the power of connected technologies.</code></pre>

<p>Apple TV keeps February 2026 fairly focused. On the movie side, there is one new Apple Original Film landing this month, and it leans into romance with a fantasy twist. If you came here looking for a longer movie slate, you will want to scan the new series arrivals too, because Apple TV has two major season premieres later in the month.</p>



<p>The headline release is <strong>Eternity</strong>, a romantic comedy set in an afterlife “junction” where the newly deceased get a limited window to decide where and with whom they will spend forever. It stars <strong>Elizabeth Olsen, Miles Teller, and Callum Turner</strong>, and it starts streaming on <strong>Friday, February 13, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>After that, Apple TV shifts from films to returning series. <strong>The Last Thing He Told Me</strong> comes back with Season 2 on <strong>Friday, February 20</strong>, and <strong>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</strong> returns for Season 2 on <strong>Friday, February 27</strong>.</p>



<h2>February release schedule</h2>



<p><strong>Eternity</strong> (Movie)</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Streaming date</strong>: Friday, Feb 13, 2026</li>



<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 hour 54 minutes</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The Last Thing He Told Me</strong> (Season 2)</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Episodes</strong>: 8</li>



<li><strong>Premiere</strong>: Friday, Feb 20, 2026</li>



<li><strong>Finale date</strong>: Friday, Apr 10, 2026</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</strong> (Season 2)</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Episodes:</strong> 10</li>



<li><strong>Premiere:</strong> Friday, Feb 27, 2026</li>



<li><strong>Finale date:</strong> Friday, May 1, 2026</li>
</ul>



<h2>Eternity</h2>



<p><strong>Eternity</strong> plays like a relationship story with a sci-fi or fantasy wrapper. After death comes “the junction,” and Joan has a week to choose her forever. The catch is emotional, not logistical. She reconnects with her long-time husband, but her first love also reappears, pulling her into a decision she never expected to make.</p>



<p>The cast does much of the heavy lifting. Elizabeth Olsen leads as Joan, with Miles Teller and Callum Turner anchoring the two sides of the choice. The tone stays in rom-com territory, but the setup gives it room to touch bigger themes like regret, timing, and the version of yourself you want to carry forward.</p>

<h2>The Last Thing He Told Me Season 2</h2>



<p>Season 2 picks up the show’s mix of family tension and suspense. Jennifer Garner returns as Hannah, and the story continues to circle a central question: what happens after you think the secrets are over, but the past refuses to stay buried. Apple is releasing the season weekly, so it will stretch well beyond February.</p>



<p>If you watched Season 1, you already know the series works best when it keeps Hannah and Bailey’s relationship at the center, even while the thriller plot pushes them from one problem to the next.</p>

<h2>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters Season 2</h2>



<p><strong>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</strong> comes back at the end of the month, again tying personal stories to large-scale Monsterverse stakes. Apple says Season 2 runs <strong>10 episodes</strong>, with a weekly rollout through <strong>May 1, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Season 1 built its momentum by moving across timelines and showing how Monarch’s work ripples through families. Season 2 looks set to widen the scope, while keeping the same core cast and the same push-pull between secrecy and survival.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>



<p><strong>Is there more than one new Apple TV movie in February 2026?</strong><br />Apple’s February originals list shows <strong>Eternity</strong> as the new film release this month, with the other highlighted February arrivals being returning series.</p>



<p><strong>Do these shows drop all at once?</strong><br />No. <strong>The Last Thing He Told Me</strong> Season 2 and <strong>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</strong> Season 2 both follow a weekly schedule after the premiere.</p>



<p><strong>How much does Apple TV cost in the US right now?</strong><br />Apple lists Apple TV at <strong>$12.99 per month</strong> in the United States, with a <strong>7-day free trial</strong> for new subscribers.</p>



<h2>Apple TV price and final note</h2>



<p>In the US, Apple TV currently costs <strong>$12.99/month</strong> after a <strong>7-day free trial</strong> for new subscribers.</p>



<p>If you are picking one thing for February, <strong>Eternity</strong> is the clean, single-night watch. If you want something that lasts into spring, the <strong>Monarch</strong> and <strong>Last Thing He Told Me</strong> weekly drops are the bigger time commitment. Let me know what you plan to watch first.</p>

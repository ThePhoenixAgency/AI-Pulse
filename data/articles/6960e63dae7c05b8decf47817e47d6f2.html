    <div><div> <p>Robert Duvall, who played the smooth mafia lawyer in "The Godfather" and stole the show with his depiction of a surfing-crazed colonel in "Apocalypse Now", died on Sunday at the age of 95, his wife Luciana Duvall confirmed Monday.</p> <p>"Yesterday we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time. Bob passed away peacefully at home," she wrote.</p> <p>Blunt-talking, prolific and glitz-averse, Duvall won <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/oscars-academy-awards/" target="_self">an Oscar</a> for best actor and was nominated six other times. Over his six decades-long career, he shone in both lead and supporting roles, and eventually became a director.</p> <p>"To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything," Luciana Duvall said. "His <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/us-cinema/" target="_self">passion for his craft</a> was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court."</p> <div> <figcaption> </figcaption> <div> <p>To display this content from Facebook, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.</p> </div>
</div> <p>Duvall won his Academy Award in 1983 for playing a washed-up country singer in "Tender Mercies".</p> <p>But his most memorable characters also included the soft-spoken, loyal mob consigliere Tom Hagen in the first two installments of "The Godfather" and the maniacal Lieutenant Colonel William Kilgore in Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/vietnam/" target="_self">Vietnam</a> War epic "Apocalypse Now".</p> <p>The latter, which earned Duvall an Oscar nomination and made him a bona fide star after years playing lesser roles, sees him utter what is now one of cinema's most famous lines.</p> <p>"I love the smell of napalm in the morning," his war-loving character&nbsp;– bare chested, cocky and sporting a big black cowboy hat&nbsp;– muses as low-flying US warplanes bomb a beachfront tree line where he wants to go surfing.</p> <p>That character was originally created to be even more over the top&nbsp;– his name was at first supposed to be Colonel Carnage&nbsp;– but Duvall had it toned down, demonstrating his meticulous approach to acting.</p> <p>"I did my homework," Duvall told veteran talk show host Larry King in 2015. "I did my research."</p> <p>Duvall was sort of a late bloomer in Hollywood&nbsp;– he was already 31 when he delivered his breakout performance as the mysterious recluse Boo Radley in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee's novel "To Kill a Mockingbird".</p> <p>He would go on to play myriad roles&nbsp;– a bullying corporate executive in "Network" (1976), a Marine officer who treats his family like soldiers in "The Great Santini" (1979), and then his star turn in "Tender Mercies."</p> <p>Duvall often said his favorite role, however, was one he played in a 1989 TV mini-series&nbsp;– the grizzled, wise-cracking Texas Ranger-turned-cowboy Augustus McCrae in "Lonesome Dove", based on the novel by Larry McMurtry.&nbsp;</p> <p>Film critic Elaine Mancini once described Duvall as "the most technically proficient, the most versatile, and the most convincing actor on the screen in the United States".</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AFP)</em></p> </div></div>

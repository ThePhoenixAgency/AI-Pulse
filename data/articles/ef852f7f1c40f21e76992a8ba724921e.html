If there actually were hedge funds massively unwinding trades… you would have seen billions. We saw many billions liquidated on these levered platforms.”</p><p>Despite short-term turbulence, Mitchnick emphasized that BlackRock remains committed to digital assets as part of a broader financial transformation. </p><p>“We see ourselves as having the role of a bridge… between traditional finance and the digital asset world,” he said. “Over time, there’s certainly going to continue to be a greater role for digital assets and this technology theme in general for many of our clients.”</p><p><strong><em>Read More: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/04/30/bitcoin-may-evolve-into-low-beta-equity-play-blackrocks-mitchnik-says">Bitcoin May Evolve Into Low-Beta Equity Play Reflexively, BlackRock's Mitchnik Says</a></em></strong></p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>Bitcoin could fall to $10,000 as U.S. recession risk builds, Mike McGlone says</p><div><p>1 hour ago</p></div><p><img alt="Bitcoin bus (Photo: Olivier Acuna/Modified by CoinDesk)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2Fa021b028c30e68542c865c02852e4bbaba5aae22-1920x1080.jpg%3Fauto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>McGlone links bitcoin’s downturn to record U.S. market cap-to-GDP levels, low equity volatility and rising gold prices, warning of potential contagion into stocks.</p><div><p>What to know: </p><div><ul><li>Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Mike McGlone warns that collapsing crypto prices and a potential bitcoin slide toward $10,000 could signal mounting financial stress and foreshadow a U.S. recession.</li><li>McGlone argues the post-2008 "buy the dip" era may be ending as crypto weakens, stock market valuations sit near century highs relative to GDP, and equity volatility remains unusually low.</li><li>Market analyst Jason Fernandes counters that a drop to $10,000 bitcoin would likely require a severe systemic shock and recession, calling such an outcome a low-probability tail risk compared with a milder reset or consolidation.</li></ul></div></div><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/16/bitcoin-s-slide-may-signal-broader-market-trouble-and-a-u-s-recession-mike-mcglone-says">Read full story</a></p></div></div></div>

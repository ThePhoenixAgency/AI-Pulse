    <pre><code>Key Insights (AI-assisted):
Crossing 100 million managed connections indicates that large-scale, cloud-native CMPs are consolidating power in cellular IoT. This scale reduces per-device connectivity and security overhead, making complex, global deployments more economically viable for OEMs and MNOs. It also accelerates the shift toward AI-driven automation in lifecycle management, observability and threat detection, which smaller platforms may struggle to match. The milestone underscores a broader IoT trend toward a few hyperscale connectivity hubs underpinning critical, safety-relevant applications. Leveraging AI-driven innovation, Aeris delivers secure, scalable solutions that transform IoT connected vehicles and shape the cellular-connected future
Aeris, a global leader in cellular management platforms, security services and connected vehicle programs, today announced a significant turning point: it has surpassed 100 million connected devices worldwide. This landmark achievement is a result of nearly 90 percent growth in additional device connections since the 2023 acquisition of the Ericsson IoT Accelerator Platform.
Surpassing the 100 million threshold, Aeris continues to outpace market growth. According to a report from Berg Insight, global cellular IoT connectivity grew by approximately 30 percent over the same period, making Aeris’ expansion nearly 3x the industry average. This growth validates Aeris’ leadership and its commitment to simplifying global deployments through AI-driven connectivity management platform innovation, IoT cybersecurity and automotive leadership, and a strong partner ecosystem.
“This milestone validates our vision of providing the world’s most trusted end-to-end solution for cellular devices,” said Aziz Benmalek, Aeris CEO and Board Director. “Reaching 100 million connections is not merely scale — it’s evidence of how rapidly we’re transforming business outcomes. By leveraging Agentic AI, we will elevate our capabilities to protect data and ensure reliability in the highest stakes environments, from connected vehicles to lifesaving medical devices.”
Aeris powers global IoT programs through the Aeris IoT Accelerator Platform, Aeris Mobility Suite, and Aeris IoT Watchtower. Frost &amp; Sullivan recently acknowledged Aeris’ leadership by presenting Aeris with its 2025 Competitive Strategy Leadership Recognition for setting new standards of excellence in the Global IoT Connectivity Management Platform (CMP) industry.
Industry Validation and Customer and Partner Trust
Many of the world’s leading enterprises, mobile network operators (MNO), and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) rely on Aeris’ secure IoT connectivity management platform. They shared their congratulations, along with a few analysts. “Well done Aeris on managing 100 million connections on your platform. Scale is key for IoT and with Aeris IoT Accelerator we can connect devices with the quality and cost efficiency expected by industries across the globe. Looking forward to joint development in the years to come.” – Martin Whitlock, CTO, Telenor Connexion
“Crossing the threshold of 100 million cellular connected IoT devices under Aeris management is a major achievement and clear indicator of scale in the IoT market. Reaching this milestone requires high levels of support skills at scale, typically associated with the largest global communications providers. This achievement not only reflects Aeris’ strong position in this market but also the huge potential for further growth of the IoT market as a whole.” – Robin Duke-Woolley, CEO, Beecham Research
“Congratulations to Aeris on reaching this remarkable milestone of 100 million devices. Orange has surely done its best to contribute! We are excited to continue our partnership and look forward to achieving even greater success together.” – Peter Raeymaekers, Head of IoT, Orange Business Belgium
“A big congratulations to Aeris on 100 million connected devices! Thank you for being a valued partner in helping us grow together.” – Felix Wunderer, SVP Head of B2B Core Mobile and Head of IoT, Swisscom
“Congratulations to the Aeris team on reaching the 100 million milestone. We are honoured to be a part of this achievement through our partnership, which enables Bridge Alliance member operators to deliver a single pane of glass, one interface for enterprises to manage all their IoT deployments via the Aeris IoT Accelerator platform. Building on our shared vision for unified global IoT connectivity, we look forward to helping Aeris reach its next 100 million.” – Dr. Ong Geok Chwee, CEO, Bridge Alliance
“Hitting 100 million connections on the Aeris IoT Accelerator platform is quite a milestone for the company. The significant effort to reinvent the platform as cloud-native and flexible has prepared it to meet the new demands being placed on it by 5G, Agentic AI, and growing cybersecurity threats.” – Matt Hatton, Founding Partner, Transforma Insights
“Aeris surpassing 100 million connections is significant. Achieving this scale in live deployments is a milestone few have reached, and it reflects the growing importance of IoT in critical operations. With AI and ML increasingly driving observability and optimisation, Aeris’ achievement positions them strongly for the future.” – Steffen Sorrell, Chief of Research, Kaleido Intelligence
“This milestone signals the rapid expansion and rising importance of IoT. As adoption scales, greater data volumes enable advanced analytics and valuable AI-driven insights. Aeris reaching this scale illustrates how leading platforms are positioned to support continued growth and meet rising expectations for IoT.” – John Gole, Research Director, IoT and Mobility, IDC
“Aeris continues to demonstrate how innovation and scale can transform the global IoT ecosystem. Through its ownership of a global cellular core network, eSIM orchestration leadership, and integrated security-enabled Connectivity Management Platform, Aeris has established a unique position as both a technology pioneer and a trusted partner for enterprises and communication service providers.” – Cecilia Perez, Industry Analyst, Frost &amp; Sullivan
“Reaching 100M IoT devices worldwide put Aeris into rarified air for connectivity providers. This level of scale has been years in the making and is a testament to Aeris’ dedication to the IoT sector.” – Keith Kreisher, Executive Director,IMC</code></pre>

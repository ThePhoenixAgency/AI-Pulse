<p><strong>Key Insights (AI-assisted):</strong><br>
Crossing 100 million managed connections indicates that large-scale, cloud-native CMPs are consolidating power in cellular IoT. This scale reduces per-device connectivity and security overhead, making complex, global deployments more economically viable for OEMs and MNOs. It also accelerates the shift toward AI-driven automation in lifecycle management, observability and threat detection, which smaller platforms may struggle to match. The milestone underscores a broader IoT trend toward a few hyperscale connectivity hubs underpinning critical, safety-relevant applications.
</p>
<h2>Leveraging AI-driven innovation, Aeris delivers secure, scalable solutions that transform IoT connected vehicles and shape the cellular-connected future</h2>
<p>Aeris, a global leader in cellular management platforms, security services and connected vehicle programs, today announced a significant turning point: it has surpassed 100 million connected devices worldwide. This landmark achievement is a result of nearly 90 percent growth in additional device connections since the 2023 acquisition of the Ericsson IoT Accelerator Platform.</p>
<p>Surpassing the 100 million threshold, Aeris continues to outpace market growth. According to a report from Berg Insight, global cellular IoT connectivity grew by approximately 30 percent over the same period, making Aeris’ expansion nearly 3x the industry average. This growth validates Aeris’ leadership and its commitment to simplifying global deployments through AI-driven connectivity management platform innovation, IoT cybersecurity and automotive leadership, and a strong partner ecosystem.</p>
<p><em>“This milestone validates our vision of providing the world’s most trusted end-to-end solution for cellular devices,”</em> said <strong>Aziz Benmalek</strong>, <strong>Aeris</strong> CEO and Board Director. <em>“Reaching 100 million connections is not merely scale — it’s evidence of how rapidly we’re transforming business outcomes. By leveraging Agentic AI, we will elevate our capabilities to protect data and ensure reliability in the highest stakes environments, from connected vehicles to lifesaving medical devices.”</em></p>
<p>Aeris powers global IoT programs through the <strong>Aeris IoT Accelerator Platform</strong>, <strong>Aeris Mobility Suite</strong>, and <strong>Aeris IoT Watchtower</strong>. Frost &amp; Sullivan recently acknowledged Aeris’ leadership by presenting Aeris with its 2025 Competitive Strategy Leadership Recognition for setting new standards of excellence in the Global IoT Connectivity Management Platform (CMP) industry.</p>
<h3>Industry Validation and Customer and Partner Trust</h3>
<p>Many of the world’s leading enterprises, mobile network operators (MNO), and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) rely on Aeris’ secure IoT connectivity management platform. They shared their congratulations, along with a few analysts.</p>

<p>Just in time for Valentines Day, Apple TV today premieres a new romantic comedy movie film <a href="https://tinyurl.com/eternityappletv">Eternity</a>, starring Elizabeth Olsen, Callum Turner and Miles Teller. </p>



<p>Based in an afterlife where souls choose their living arrangements in eternity, Joan is faced with the choice of continuing her marriage with her long-term husband, or picking her first love, a man who died young and was waiting for her to arrive all this time. The movie was originally released last year in theaters by A24, and is now <a href="https://tinyurl.com/getappletvplus">streaming on Apple TV</a>. </p>



<p>Joan is the center of the story, played by Elizabeth Olsen. Callum Turner plays the role of Joan’s deceased first love, Luke, who died in the Korean war. Larry is played by Miles Teller, Joan’s long-term current husband. </p>



<p>The conceit is that each deceased person gets to choose where they want to go for Eternity. Upon his death, Larry decides to wait for for Joan before making a decision. But he discovers that Luke has actually been waiting for over 50 years, to reconvene with Joan. Upon her passing, Joan is confronted with these cross-roads, which makes for the bulk of the film’s narrative.</p>



<p>Obviously, the themes of the film are well-timed for a Valentines Day streaming release. It’s a feel-good weekend watch, mixing satire with romance in an enjoyable and satisfying plot.</p>



<p>The film has been warmly received by both critics and audiences that saw it during its theatrical run. It currently has a 77% Rotten Tomatoes score. </p>



<p>You can watch it yourself right now on the Apple TV app, with an Apple TV subscription. Get a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/getappletvplus">free seven-day trial</a> for new accounts here, and stream the movie anywhere you can get the TV app. </p>

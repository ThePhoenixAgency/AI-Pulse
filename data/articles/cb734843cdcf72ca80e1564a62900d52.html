  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>Philippine vice-president Sara Duterte, daughter of the imprisoned former leader Rodridgo Duterte, has announced she will run for president in the country’s 2028 election.</p><p>Sara Duterte, 47, said she would offer her “life, strength and future” in service of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/philippines">Philippines</a>, in a speech on Wednesday that accused President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, of presiding over a period marked by rampant corruption.</p><p>Sara Duterte was once allied with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ferdinand-marcos-jr">Marcos Jr</a>, and ran on a joint ticket with him in the 2022 election, where they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/ferdinand-marcos-jr-triumph-philippines-presidential-election">won a landslide victory</a>. However, she resigned from the cabinet two years later, after the two politicians became embroiled in a bitter feud.</p><p>Relations between them reached rock bottom last year after Rodrigo Duterte was arrested in Manila and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/11/rodrigo-duterte-arrest-manila-former-philippines-president-war-on-drugs-ntwnfb">dramatically flown to The Hague</a> to face charges of crimes against humanity at the international criminal court (ICC). At the time, Sara Duterte condemned his arrest as “oppression and persecution”.</p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/rodrigo-duterte">Rodrigo Duterte</a> will appear before the ICC next week for a pre-trial hearing. The case relates to killings committed during his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/04/rodrigo-dutertes-war-on-drugs-in-the-philippines-explained-in-30-seconds-ntwnfb">anti-drugs “crackdowns”</a>, where thousands of people were gunned down in the streets, many of them men in poor, urban areas.</p><p>Duterte said after his arrest that he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/13/rodrigo-duterte-former-philippines-president-video-message-icc-arrest-over-war-on-drugs-ntwnfb">accept responsibility</a> for the crackdowns. In 2024, he told a senate inquiry into the killings that he offered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/28/rodrigo-duterte-testifies-philippines-war-on-drugs-inquiry">“no apologies, no excuses”</a> for his policies, saying: “I did what I had to do, and whether you believe it or not, I did it for my country.”</p><p>In her speech on Wednesday, Sara Duterte apologised for once running in tandem with Marcos, her ally-turned-nemesis, saying she was sorry she had once helped his election bid.</p><p>“I am sorry if there is blatant abuse of our institutions for the personal interests of politicians. I am sorry that the prices of basic goods continue to rise while the income of every family remains insufficient. I am sorry that we do not even have genuine food security. I am sorry that some are falling ill and losing their lives because of the lack of a proper and effective healthcare system,” she said in a press briefing.</p><p>Polls suggests Sara Duterte would be a strong contender in a future election. Her father, who styled himself as a straight-talking everyman, remained popular throughout his presidency, despite international condemnation over his so-called “war on drugs”.</p><div><p>Sara Duterte is also facing legal troubles. Impeachment cases have been filed against her, including most recently by a group of nuns, priests, and lawyers, accusing her of misuse of funds as vice-president and when she was previously education secretary. She has also been accused of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/03/philippine-president-removes-deputy-from-security-council-after-alleged-plot-to-kill-him">threatening to assassinate</a> president Marcos. She has previously denied such allegations. </p><p> Sara Duterte was impeached last year, though the case was later thrown out by the country’s supreme court over procedural issues.</p></div><p>Like her father, Sara Duterte has been known for her extreme rhetoric. She once threatened to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/philippines-vice-president-sarah-duterte-ferdinand-marcos-threat-remains-father">dig up the remains of Marcos’ dictator father</a> and throw them into the sea.</p><p>Speaking on Wednesday she explained her decision to run for the presidency, saying: “It took me 47 years to understand that my life was never meant to be only mine. Unlike others, I may not have been born just to chase happiness. For a long time I questioned the weight of responsibility to my family, to my country, to everyone who called upon me. Today, I have peacefully accepted that my life is unlike any other.”</p><p>President Marcos cannot seek re-election because he is limited to a single six-year term under the constitution. He has faced increased pressure over a corruption scandal, after it emerged billions of dollars had allegedly been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/protests-philippines-corruption-state-flood">misspent on bogus flood relief projects</a>. Marcos has pledged zero tolerance for corruption and said those found to have misused funds will face jail.</p></div></div>

    <div><p>Joachim Nagel said euro-pegged stablecoins would offer the bloc more independence from US dollar-pegged coins soon to be allowed under the GENIUS Act.</p><div><div><p>Joachim Nagel, president of Germany’s central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, supported the introduction of a euro-pegged central bank digital currency (CBDC) and euro-denominated stablecoins for payments.</p><p>In remarks prepared for a speech at the New Year’s Reception of the American Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt on Monday, Nagel <a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/en/press/speeches/priorities-and-challenges-for-europe-in-a-changing-world-989870" target="_blank">said</a> EU officials were “working hard” toward the introduction of a retail CBDC. Euro-denominated stablecoins, according to the central bank president, could also contribute to “making Europe more independent in terms of payment systems and solutions.”</p><p>“Notably, a wholesale CBDC would allow financial institutions to make programmable payments in central bank money,” said Nagel. “I also see merit in euro-denominated stablecoins, as they can be used for cross-border payments by individuals and firms at low cost.”</p><p>Nagel’s remarks come months after US President Donald Trump signed a bill into law <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/banking-lobby-change-genius-act">establishing a framework for payment stablecoins</a> in the country, potentially setting US dollar-pegged stablecoins on a path to challenge any possible rollout of a euro-pegged peer. The law is expected to be fully implemented 18 months after it was signed or 120 days after related regulations are finalized.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ing-germany-crypto-etp-etn-bitwise-vaneck"><em><strong>ING Germany expands crypto ETP and ETN offerings with Bitwise, VanEck</strong></em></a></p><p>The German central bank president’s comment on stablecoins did not include risks he <a href="https://www.bundesbank.de/en/press/speeches/european-monetary-policy-challenges-in-the-new-geopolitical-environment-989612#tar-1" target="_blank">mentioned </a>last week at the Euro50 Group meeting.

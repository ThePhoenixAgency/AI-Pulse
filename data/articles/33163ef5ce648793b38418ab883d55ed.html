<p>Apple is preparing to enter the foldable phone market, and a new leak claims the company is testing a second design beyond its first foldable model. While the book-style foldable iPhone is widely expected to launch first, reports now suggest that Apple has also tested a clamshell version often referred to as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/everything-we-know-about-apples-rumored-iphone-flip/">iPhone Flip</a>. The key question is whether this model will move beyond internal testing.</p>



<p>The first foldable iPhone is expected to use a book-style design that opens like a small tablet. However, interest in a flip-style version continues to grow. This design folds vertically, similar to other clamshell phones, and focuses on portability. If Apple moves forward with it, the iPhone Flip would target users who want a compact device that easily fits in a pocket.</p>



<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/report-apple-is-testing-an-iphone-flip-with-a-square-foldable-design/">previously said</a> Apple had a square, clamshell foldable “under consideration.” That suggested Apple was exploring the concept but had not committed to launching it. Now, a new update from Weibo leaker Fixed Focus Digital indicates progress may be further along.</p>



<p>Now, according to ‘<a target="_blank" href="http://Apple is preparing to enter the foldable phone market, and a new leak claims the company is testing a second design beyond its first foldable model. While the book style foldable iPhone is widely expected to launch first, reports now suggest that Apple has also tested a clamshell version often referred to as the iPhone Flip. The key question is whether this model will move beyond internal testing.  The first foldable iPhone is expected to use a book style design that opens like a small tablet. However, interest around a flip style version continues to grow. This design folds vertically, similar to other clamshell phones, and focuses on portability. If Apple moves forward with it, the iPhone Flip would target users who want a compact device that easily fits in a pocket.  Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman previously said Apple had a square, clamshell foldable “under consideration.” That suggested Apple was exploring the concept but had not committed to launching it. Now, a new update from Weibo leaker Fixed Focus Digital indicates progress may be further along.  According to Fixed Focus Digital, Apple has officially tested a ‘Flip’ style folding iPhone, adding that whether flip can reach mass production can be noticed. The post also stated, Not only the fold is being tested, but whether flip can reach mass production can be noticed. The wording suggests Apple has built and evaluated prototypes, though mass production remains uncertain.  What This Means for Apple’s Foldable Plans  Testing does not guarantee a launch. Apple often evaluates multiple hardware designs before selecting one for production. However, internal testing shows that the company is serious about exploring both foldable formats.  Right now, the timeline looks clearer for the book style model:  iPhone Fold Expected launch: Late 2026 Design: Book style foldable Rumored inner display: Around 7.7 to 7.8 inches  For the flip model, expectations remain less certain:  iPhone Flip Status: Tested internally Mass production: Not confirmed Possible launch window: 2027 or later  If Apple approves the clamshell design for production, it would likely arrive after the first foldable iPhone. For now, the iPhone Flip remains a tested concept rather than a confirmed product. Still, the fact that Apple is actively evaluating both designs signals that foldables are becoming a serious part of its long term strategy.">Fixed Focus Digital</a>‘, Apple has officially tested a ‘Flip’ style folding iPhone.

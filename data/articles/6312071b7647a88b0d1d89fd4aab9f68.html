<p><strong>Key Insights (AI-assisted):</strong><br>
By shrinking form factor while extending network reach, Samsara is pushing asset tracking deeper into the long tail of tools and equipment that are typically unmanaged. Combining an industrial Bluetooth mesh with crowdsourced smartphone signals foreshadows a more hybrid, multi-rail location infrastructure across IoT. Embedding AI workflows for incident detection and ROI quantification shifts value from mere visibility to operational and financial decision support. This move underscores a broader trend toward ubiquitous, battery-powered tracking of low-cost, high-impact assets in physical operations.
</p>
<h2>Samsara’s Best-in-Class Network Doubles in Size; New AI Theft and Loss Workflow Enables Rapid Recovery of Small, High-Value Assets</h2>
<p>Samsara Inc., the pioneer of the Connected Operations Platform, today announced its latest-generation <strong>Asset Tag</strong> and all-new <strong>Asset Tag XS</strong>, designed to help operations and fleet equipment managers track and recover high-value assets of all sizes. Powered by the expanded Samsara Network, the new tags are equipped with an AI-powered theft and loss workflow to help customers proactively identify, investigate, and recover mission-critical assets in record time.</p>
<p>Rich Poppoff, Equipment Superintendent, DeSilva Gates, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since we started using the Asset Tags, our recovery rate on thefts of everything from $1,000 gas-powered saws to $2.8 million heavy machinery is 100%.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>“I didn’t think the devices could be better than they were, but the enhanced features on the Asset Tags, like the even more precise find nearby capabilities, make finding assets in congested areas even simpler.”</em></p>
<h3>The strongest operations network just got better</h3>
<p>Over the last two years, Samsara’s Network has doubled in density, reinforcing its position as the industry’s leading <strong>industrial-grade Bluetooth network</strong>. This expansive <strong>mesh network</strong> leverages millions of Samsara-connected devices that travel on 99% of major U.S. roads. By using industrial-grade Bluetooth signals to continuously ‘listen’ for Asset Tags, a single Asset Tag can be detected in real time.</p>
<p>To provide an even more comprehensive view, Samsara has integrated&nbsp;<strong>Hubble’s terrestrial network</strong>, comprised of 90M consumer smartphones. This integration builds on Samsara’s presence on roads, at job sites, and in residential areas by extending visibility into buildings.</p>
<p><em>“The integration with Hubble complements Samsara’s existing network,”</em> said David Gal, VP of Connected Equipment at Samsara. <em>“The Samsara Network leverages millions of gateways on assets from construction sites to highways to garbage trucks, while Hubble’s network uses primarily consumer smartphones, ensuring no lost or stolen asset can hide, even inside buildings. The best network in the business just got better, delivering unprecedented asset visibility.”</em></p>
<h3>Unmatched intelligence delivers increased visibility and rapid asset recovery</h3>
<p>With Samsara’s end-to-end theft and loss workflow, organizations can now detect at‑risk assets sooner, investigate incidents, and coordinate fast recoveries.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proactively identify at-risk equipment:</strong>&nbsp;With the new Left Behind Incident feature, managers are immediately notified when an asset is separated from its vehicle outside a trusted geofence. Rather than discovering the loss days or weeks later, customers can respond in real time to recover assets and prevent costly disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Investigate with real-time information:</strong>&nbsp;Customers can mark an asset as missing and see critical<b>&nbsp;</b>context, such as photos of who last had the asset, which vehicle it was last seen with, and more, powered by StreetSense. This rich context helps determine the most efficient recovery method and allocates the resources needed for a successful retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>Rapidly recover assets and avoid lost time:</strong>&nbsp;Customers can coordinate quick asset recovery by dispatching a driver or sharing asset location with law enforcement. Once dispatched, crews can quickly pinpoint an asset’s exact location using Compass Mode.</li>
<li><strong>Demonstrate return on investment:</strong>&nbsp;The new Asset Tag Overview page analyzes asset photos with AI to calculate the value of assets protected and recovered. By tracking the total dollar value of assets, managers can demonstrate financial impact on the business.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sized for equipment big and small. There’s nothing you can’t track.</h3>
<p>The new Asset Tags are ruggedized devices engineered to operate in the most extreme and remote environments. With the compact Asset Tag and ultra-compact Asset Tag XS, equipment managers can mix and match devices based on the equipment’s size and shape.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Tag:</strong>&nbsp;Designed for both large and small equipment, the Asset Tag provides up to six years of maintenance-free battery life—a 50% increase over the previous generation.</li>
<li><strong>Asset Tag XS:</strong>&nbsp;Ideal for even smaller, high-value handheld tools or specialized equipment such as gas meters or IV pumps, the ultra-compact Asset Tag XS offers three years of battery life and flexible mounting options for the most obscure equipment.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“The scale of equipment loss in physical operations goes far beyond the cost of the tools themselves—it’s about lost productivity and project delays,”</em> said David Gal, VP of Connected Equipment at Samsara. <em>“To solve this, we’re doubling down on innovation, laying the foundation for new use cases. We’ve supercharged the network, the hardware, and the recovery workflow, and with the Asset Tag XS, now even the smallest assets stay within reach.”</em></p>
<h3>New research reveals the multi-million dollar impact of asset loss</h3>
<p>In physical operations, small assets play a big role in getting the job done; however, keeping track of these mission-critical tools is a growing challenge.</p>
<p>Research from Samsara’s forthcoming&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.samsara.com/pdf/docs/asset-theft-and-loss-report-one-pager.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of Connected Operations: Asset Theft &amp; Loss</a></i>&nbsp;report shows that in the past 12 months, 77% of organizations say a missing critical asset has resulted in a significant operational shutdown or delay. Moreover, asset shrinkage costs the average organization without an asset tracking solution more than $13 million annually, with smaller assets driving more than 70% of that cost.</p> </div></div>

It’s proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. <strong>We have to make a meaningful deal, otherwise, bad things happen, but we have to make a meaningful deal,”</strong> Trump said.</p><p>He added:</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation mark<strong>We do have some work to do with Iran.

is moving to arrest thousands of people already legally admitted to the US as refugees and detain them indefinitely for aggressive “rescreening”, a report published on Thursday said.</strong></p><p>Under the new policy, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that federal immigration officers can and should arrest anyone who has not yet obtained the right to permanent residence, a so-called green card, and subject them to interviews to assess their refugee claims while they are in custody, as first reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2026/02/18/trump-immigrants-refugees-minnesota-memo/">the Washington Post</a>.</p><p>The memo reverses a 2010 Obama administration policy that said failure to apply for a green card within a year of admission to the US was insufficient basis for such an arrest or detention, the newspaper reported.</p><p>The DHS move is pertinent to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/28/judge-trump-minnesota-refugees">ongoing case</a> in Minneapolis in which a federal judge last month blocked the Trump administration from further arrests of settled refugees in Minnesota, and ordered the release of at least 100 more arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>).</p><p>Officials said “Operation Parris”, which targeted about 5,600 refugees in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/minnesota">Minnesota</a> who had not yet become permanent residents, was “a sweeping initiative re-examining thousands of refugee cases through new background checks and intensive verification of refugee claims”.</p><figure></figure></article><article><header></header><p>We’re keeping an eye on lawmakers who are rebukingDonald Trump’s announcement that the US will pledge $10bn to the Board of Peace – of which the president serves as chair.</p><p>Trump offered no explanation as to how he plans to secure this money, nor did he mention whether he has sought approval from Congress, who would need to vote on a specific appropriations bill for the funds.</p><p>Senator <strong>Chris Murphy</strong>, who sits on the upper chamber’s foreign relations committee called the move <strong>“totally illegal”</strong>.</p></article><article><header><h2>Top oversight Democrat says former prince's arrest is 'enormous step' in fight to secure justice for Epstein survivors</h2></header><p>In response to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest today, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, Robert Garcia, said that it is <strong>“an enormous step forward in our fight to secure justice”</strong> for the Jeffrey Epstein’s survivors.</p><p>In November, oversight Democrats called for the former prince to sit for questioning as part of their ongoing investigation into the handling of the Epstein case. <strong>“Britain is now holding him accountable with this arrest. Now it’s time for the United States to end this White House cover-up,”</strong> Garcia added in a statement.</p><p>Other Democratic members of Congress welcomed the news of Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, and how it might impact accountability stateside.</p><p><strong>“Even princes are not above the law,”</strong> said congressman Ro Khanna, who led the effort to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act. “<strong>But why isn’t more being done here? We should start with Howard Lutnick resigning,”</strong> he added, referring to Donald Trump’s commerce secretary –&nbsp;who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/10/howard-lutnick-epstein-private-island">admitted</a> that he visited Epstein on his private island in 2012, four years after the disgraced financier was convicted on state charges of soliciting prostitution. This, despite Lutnick’s claims that he was no longer in touch with Epstein after 2005.</p><figure></figure></article><article><header><p><span>Melody Schreiber</span></p></header><p><strong>Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health">Health</a> (NIH), was named the acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday</strong>, making him the fourth leader in a year at the embattled agency in an unprecedented move that further consolidates power among a small group of men at the helm of US health agencies.</p><p>He’s been an ineffectual health leader whose attention will be further fractured, and as a close ally to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime vaccine critic. Bhattacharya may sign off on further changes to the vaccine schedule, observers said.</p><figure><div><img alt="Jay Bhattacharya attends an event with first lady Melania Trump at The Children's Inn in Bethesda, Maryland, 11 February 2026." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0ed1b58b55372338bf5d2a78eec8dbfa068903e/402_0_4021_3217/master/4021.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Jay Bhattacharya attends an event with first lady Melania Trump at The Children's Inn in Bethesda, Maryland, 11 February 2026.</span> Photograph: Nathan Howard/AP</figcaption></figure><p>Bhattacharya will continue serving in his current role as NIH director, where he has overseen dramatic cuts to research and staff. The CDC has similarly slashed grants to states and enacted massive layoffs even as officials under Kennedy have dramatically reshaped policy on routine vaccinations.</p><p>Staff say the controversial health economist has had little to do with the daily operations of the NIH.</p><p>“He won’t actually run the CDC. Just as he doesn’t actually run NIH,” said <strong>Jenna Norton</strong>, an NIH program officer speaking in her personal capacity.</p><p><strong>Jeremy Berg</strong>, former director of National Institute of General Medical Sciences, had a similar response. “Now, rather than largely ignoring the actual operations of one agency, he can largely ignore the actual operations of two,” he said.</p><p>Bhattacharya, who made a name opposing measures to prevent Covid-19, has strongly criticized officials who fund research and advise on policy simultaneously.</p><p>“Bureaucrats who fund the careers of scientists should play no role whatsoever in setting pandemic policy,” Bhattacharya wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/DrJBhattacharya/status/1472328515252932610">post</a> on Twitter/X in December 2021, saying the “dual role” was a conflict of interest that silenced scientists.</p><p><em>Read Melody’s full report: </em></p><figure></figure></article><article><header></header><p><strong>Edi Rama</strong>, the prime minister of Albania, refuted claims from Nato allies that the Board of Peace would undermine the authority of the United Nations.</p><p>“It does not look to me like an attempt to replace the UN,” Rama said. “But if it helps shake that agonizing giant then inshallah, wake it up.”</p></article><article><header></header><p>Attending today’s event is former British prime minister <strong>Tony Blair</strong>, who extolled Donald Trump’s so-called 20-point peace plan for Gaza.</p><p><strong>“This is a vision of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> as part of the Middle East at peace, not a phoney piece of declarations no one means, and agreements no one intends to keep,”</strong> Blair said.</p><p>“Whether you’re a Muslim, Jew, Christian, of any faith or none –&nbsp;you can rise by your own efforts and feel your government by your side, not on your back. That is the vision behind President Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, and it remains the best, indeed the only hope for Gaza, the region and the wider world.”</p><figure><div><img alt="Tony Blair, former prime minister of the UK, attends a Board of Peace meeting at the US Institute of Peace, 19 February 2026." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3801e67b7f202216f586d2e338f5b336841a0af1/185_0_3991_3194/master/3991.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Tony Blair, former prime minister of the UK, attends a Board of Peace meeting at the US Institute of Peace, 19 February 2026.</span> Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/AP</figcaption></figure></article><article><header><h2>Trump says Board of Peace will be 'looking over' the United Nations</h2></header><p>Donald Trump noted today that his Board of Peace plans to work with the United Nations (UN) “very closely” moving forward. This comes as several ally countries –&nbsp;including the Vatican – have eschewed joining the board because it could usurp the UN’s power.</p><p>“I think the United Nations has great potential, really great potential,” Trump said. “The Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly.”</p><p>The president noted that if the UN needs help “money wise”, the Board of Peace is prepared to step in.</p></article><article><header><h2>US to pledge $10bn to Board of Peace</h2></header><p>Donald Trump said the United States will contribute $10bn to his Board of Peace. A reminder, that the president said over the weekend that member states have pledged $5bn to be a part of the board.</p><p>“When you look at that compared to the cost of war, that’s two weeks of fighting, it’s a very small number. It sounds like a lot, but it’s a very small number,” Trump said, a nod to the emerging chorus of frustration at the administration’s substantial involvement in foreign policy.</p><p>The president offered no details about how the US would send this money to the board, or if he’s requested approval from Congress for the funds.</p></article><article><header><h2>Trump says US has 'some work' to do with Iran, repeats call for country to end nuclear program</h2></header><p>On Iran, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> praised Steve Witkoff’s diplomatic efforts with the Republic. “Iran is a hot spot right now,” Trump said, noting that both Witkoff and Jared Kushner –&nbsp;another envoy and the president’s son-in-law – have a good relationship with the representatives Iran. “Good talks are being had.

World leaders and delegates mainly from the Middle East and Asia are gathered for a family photo before the speeches begin at the recently renamed Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace. Trump enters the room and exchanges a few words with Viktor Orbán, a rightwing ally and a rare European leader who has chosen to attend the event. US Nato allies have chosen not to join the organisation and send observers instead, with some saying the Board of Peace undermines other international organisations like the United Nations. Trump then exchanges handshakes with a number of autocrats including Azerbaijan’s Ilham Aliyev, as well as rightwing allies like Argentina’s Javier Milei.</p><p>US speakers include Trump, secretary of state Marco Rubio, envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz. JD Vance is there for the photo but is not scheduled to speak.</p><p>The speaking list is dominated by Gulf countries, with representatives for Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar all set to speak, as well as the leaders of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, the foreign minister of Turkey and the president of Romania.</p><p>Also somewhat surprisingly delegates will see a video presentation by Fifa. Though that may not be surprising given Fifa president Gianni Infantino’s close relationship with Trump.</p><p>“I think we have to smile,” Trump says. “A lot of good people.”</p><p>“Does everybody like the music? It’s good music.”</p><p>We’re just moments away.</p></article><article><header></header><p>As we wait for the Board of Peace event to begin, my colleague Jakub Krupa notes that <strong>Italy, Poland, Czech Republic and Romania</strong> are among more than a dozen of countries sending senior officials to the meeting, but only <strong>Hungary</strong> is <em>actually </em>expected to be part of the board as a member. This comes as several key European allies, as well as the Vatican, snubbed the US’ invitation to join the board.</p></article><article><header><h2>Lawmakers push war powers resolution to curb possible military action in Iran</h2></header><p>Congressmen<strong> Ro Khanna</strong> and <strong>Thomas Massie</strong> plan to introduce a war powers resolution next week, and try to force a vote on the House floor, to curb the Trump administration’s possible military action against Iran.</p><p>“Trump officials say there’s a 90% chance of strikes on Iran. He can’t without Congress,” <a href="https://x.com/rokhanna/status/2024259912197460101?s=46">said</a> Khanna, a California Democrat, amid the reports that the US is positioning aircraft carriers and amassing a large arsenal of fighter jets for a potential strikes.</p><p>He’s teamed up with Republican Massie – whom he worked with to push the Epstein Files Transparency Act on to the House floor – on the legislation.</p><p>“I first got into politics to end the Iraq War. I won’t let Trump launch a disastrous war without Congress voting to stop it,” Khanna added.</p></article></div></div>

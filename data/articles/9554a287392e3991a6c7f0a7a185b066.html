But White House press secretary <strong>Karoline Leavitt</strong> said on Wednesday that the two sides remained apart on some issues.</p><p>Trump said “good talks are being had”, and a senior US official told Reuters that Iran would make a written proposal on how to address US concerns.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, called on Tehran to join the US on the “path to peace”.</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markThey can’t have a nuclear weapon, it’s very simple.

Georgia.</p><p>So far, the most eye-catching claim has been Trump’s statement, unsupported by anything like evidence, that he has triumphed over “affordability”.</p><p>“Do you notice, what word have you not heard over the last two weeks? Affordability. Because I’ve won, I’ve won affordability. I had to go out and talk about it,” the president said, in the clearest example yet of his deep-seated belief that the cost-of-living crisis so many Americans are experiencing is a partisan attack on him, rather than reality.</p><p>Trump is speaking in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, where early voting began this week in <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2026/02/17/the-race-is-on-to-replace-former-congresswoman-marjorie-taylor-greene-in-northwest-georgia-district/">an election</a> to replace the district’s previous representative, <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong>, who resigned from Congress in January after publicly breaking with Trump over issues including his claim that her concern about the victims of <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>’s sex crimes was also “a hoax”.</p></article><article><header></header><p>The Trump banner on the justice department building has already received some criticism as a sign of the president’s overarching power over the nation’s legal arm.</p><p><strong>Bill Kristol</strong>, a prominent conservative commentator and founder of The Weekly Standard, <a href="https://x.com/BillKristol/status/2024577129472516578">said on X</a>, “Shameful—but in a way useful.

The banner, hung between two columns on one corner of the building, says, “Make America Safe Again,” a slogan used by the administration to tout its efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration and violent crime.</p>

He wrote:</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markShould Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>A pre-emptive strike on Iran would be unlikely to be in line with the UK’s interpretation of international law</strong>. US bases in the UK, like Fairford in Gloucestershire, the home for US B-2 bombers in Europe, are only used for military operations if the UK government agrees and they are considered legal.</p><p><strong>UK government sources said this was viewed as the reason for Trump to again turn against the Chagos plan</strong>.</p><p><em>Here’s the full story:</em></p><figure></figure></article><article><header><h2>Trump warns Iran 'bad things' will happen if they fail to make a 'meaningful' deal, and appears to set 10-day deadline for US military action</h2></header><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has warned <strong>Iran</strong> that “bad things” will happen if no deal is reached and appeared to set a 10-day deadline before the US might take action.</p><p>During the first Board of Peace meeting, Trump said negotiations with Iran were going well but <strong>insisted that Tehran has to reach a “meaningful” agreement</strong>. “<strong>Otherwise, bad things happe</strong>n,” he said.</p><p>Trump spoke of the airstrikes the US carried out in June on Iran’s nuclear facilities, claiming that the country’s nuclear potential had been “decimated”. “<strong>We may have to take it a step further or we may not</strong>,” he said, hinting that he could take a decision very soon.</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation mark<strong>You’ll be finding out over the next probably 10 days</strong>.</p>
</blockquote><p>Trump’s comments follow months of massive US military buildup of aircraft carriers, warships and jets in the region – its largest<a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/u-s-gathers-the-most-air-power-in-the-mideast-since-the-2003-iraq-invasion-98ced89f?mod=hp_lead_pos1"> since the 2003 invasion of Iraq</a> – that has fuelled fears that a full-scale attack on Iran could be imminent.</p><p>Iranian and US negotiators met on Tuesday and Iran’s foreign minister <strong>Abbas Araghchi</strong> said they had agreed on “guiding principles”. But White House press secretary <strong>Karoline Leavitt</strong> said on Wednesday that the two sides remained apart on some issues.</p><p>Trump said “good talks are being had”, and a senior US official told Reuters that Iran would make a written proposal on how to address US concerns.</p><p>Trump, meanwhile, called on Tehran to join the US on the “path to peace”.</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markThey can’t have a nuclear weapon, it’s very simple. You can’t have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon.</p>

Now it’s time for the United States to end this White House cover-up,”</strong> Garcia added in a statement.</p><p>Other Democratic members of Congress welcomed the news of Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, and how it might impact accountability stateside.</p><p><strong>“Even princes are not above the law,”</strong> said congressman Ro Khanna, who led the effort to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act. “<strong>But why isn’t more being done here? We should start with Howard Lutnick resigning,”</strong> he added, referring to Donald Trump’s commerce secretary –&nbsp;who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/10/howard-lutnick-epstein-private-island">admitted</a> that he visited Epstein on his private island in 2012, four years after the disgraced financier was convicted on state charges of soliciting prostitution.

<p>This month I have been doing a lot of <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Panther+Lake">Panther Lake</a> benchmarking under Linux with the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-core-ultra-x7-358h-linux">Core Ultra X7 358H</a>. One of the areas of much interest has been the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/intel-arc-b390-panther-lake-linux">Arc B390 Xe3 graphics</a> that have been working nicely out-of-the-box with the Intel open-source driver stack on Linux although there still are <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/windows-linux-panther-lake">some gaps to fill against Windows</a>. Those Intel Arc B390 Linux benchmarks so far have been focused on OpenGL and Vulkan graphics, but what about OpenCL and GPU compute with the open-source Intel Compute Runtime? Today's article is looking at the performance of the Xe3 Panther Lake graphics on the newest Compute Runtime release compared to prior Intel graphics generations and the AMD Ryzen AI competition.</p>

<p>Today is our first look at the GPU compute performance of the Arc B390 using the open-source Intel Compute Runtime with their production support for Panther Lake. This testing of all the Intel graphics hardware testing was done using the latest <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-CR-26.05.37020.3">Intel Compute Runtime 26.05.37020.3 with Intel Graphics Compiler 2.28.4</a> plus using the Linux 6.19 kernel. This latest Compute Runtime stack was compared to the AMD laptop graphics using ROCm 7.2. Linux 6.19 atop Ubuntu 26.04 development was consistent across all laptops tested and also using the performance profile on each of the laptops tested. The comparison points for today's benchmarking included:</p>
<p>- Intel Core i7 1185G7 Tiger Lake with the Dell XPS 13 9310.<br />
- Intel Core i7 1280P Alder Lake with the MSI Prestige 14 EVo A12M.<br />
- Intel Core Ultra 7 155H Meteor Lake with the MSI Swift SFG14-72T.<br />
- Intel Core Ultra 7 258V Lunar Lake with the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13.<br />
- Intel Core Ultra X7 358H Panther Lake with the MSI Prestige 14 Flip AI+ D3MTG MS-14T2.<br />
- AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 Strix Point with the ASUS Zenbook S 14.</p>
<p>The testing went back as far as Tiger Lake given that is the cut-off for the current Intel Compute Runtime releases for their Intel iGPU support.</p>

<p>The laptops were tested based on what I have available in the lab for fresh (re)testing. As noted, unfortunately, no Ryzen AI Max+ "Strix Halo" review samples on hand after the HP ZBook Ultra G1a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 review sample needed to be returned back to HP. Thanks to Intel for providing the Panther Lake laptop review sample for all the Linux testing this month on Phoronix.</p>
<p>Beyond looking at the raw GPU compute performance the SoC power consumption was also monitored for this laptop iGPU compute comparison. In the prior Arc B390 article are Vulkan compute benchmarks for those interested in Vulkan compute or even Vulkan AI workloads with Llama.cpp.</p>

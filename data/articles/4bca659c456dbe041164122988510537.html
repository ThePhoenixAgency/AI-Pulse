"We had to get security to protect us 24 hours a day."</p></div><div><p>Asked if he was considering a White House run, the retired Navy captain said he was considering it "because we're in some seriously challenging times".</p></div><div><p>The 61-year-old, who is a former astronaut, noted he was very different from most senators. </p></div><div><p>"I'm one of the very few engineers, I'm the only person with a graduate degree in engineering in the United States Senate. I've got combat experience, that's kind of rare. I spent 25 years in the military," he said.</p></div><div><p>He added: "It's a serious decision. I just haven't made it yet."</p></div><div><p>Kelly, 61, and five other lawmakers, who had all either served in the military or had roles in intelligence, have been targeted by the government after they published a 90-second video encouraging troops to disobey orders they deemed illegal. </p></div><div><p>It was released at the time of rising questions of the legality regarding American strikes on alleged narco-trafficking boats off the coast of South America.</p></div><div><p>But Kelly said he expected Trump to continue his legal action against him.</p></div><div><p>He added: "This is not going to end by me going away. I'm going to continue to fight this thing even if it goes all the way to the Supreme Court."</p></div><div><p>Critics of the Trump administration have called the government's crackdown on the six lawmakers an attack on free speech and said it was another instance of the president seeking to punish those he perceives as political enemies.</p></div><div><p>"Donald Trump, is so reckless about what he says," he said. "There are folks out there that, you know, react to what he said and people listen to him."</p></div><div><p>The BBC has contacted the White House for comment.</p></div><div><p>Among the other Democrats considering a presidential run are <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2n7k2veywo">Kamala Harris</a>, who lost to Trump in 2024, and California Governor Gavin Newsom. </p></div><div><p>Ina BBC interview in October, Harris said she would "possibly" be president one day and was confident there would be a woman in the White House in future.</p></div><div><p>However, he has also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them "unstoppable".</p></div></article></div></div>

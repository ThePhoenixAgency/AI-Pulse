<hr /><ul><li><strong>The TEAC TN 400BT X/TB now comes in turquoise</strong></li><li><strong>This premium turntable costs $629.99, available spring</strong></li><li><strong>Designed for Bluetooth, but has wired output too</strong></li></ul><hr /><p>Saying the word 'Bluetooth' around an audiophile can be like saying 'Macbeth' around actors or 'lager' around a beer snob, but the TEAC TN 400BT X/TB aims to be <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/turntables/the-best-turntables">the best turntable</a> for people who want wire-free listening.</p><p>This is a new spin on 2024's TB 400BT X, which eschews that model's wooden build for a funky turquoise design. As someone who's used to testing all-black models like the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/turntables/i-tested-the-entry-level-turntable-that-everyone-raves-about-and-i-totally-get-it">Sony PS-LX310BT</a>, it's an attractive look.</p><p>TEAC's new turntable is due out in the spring, costing $629.99. It's being billed as a limited-edition release, only on sale for a short while, so you should keep your eyes out at your local Hi-Fi shop if you're interested.</p><h2>Bluetooth for a blue plate-spinner</h2><p>As the 'BT' in the name gives away, this is a model designed for Bluetooth listening, and TEAC has stacked it full of useful features. It can transmit through aptX Adaptive, aptX and SBC, so you won't lose as much data over the airwaves as on some alternatives.</p><p>There's a Phono EQ preamplifier built in, and the tonearm bears an AT95E cartridge. All the bells and whistles are in place with a counterweight, anti-skating mechanism and tonearm lifter.</p><p>You don't have to rely on wireless transmission either, with RCA jacks for line and phono outputs. The platter is made from aluminum, moved with a rubber flat-belt, and it can play at three speeds: 33 1/3, 45 and 78 RPM.</p><p>TEAC's Hi-Fi tech isn't always affordable, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/teacs-new-hi-fi-amplifier-is-made-to-power-hardcore-audiophile-systems-but-in-a-super-compact-size">like its $2,300 amplifier</a> which will supercharge your speakers, so the $600 price tag for a turntable feels relatively affordable in comparison. It's not as cheap as the $500 <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pro-ject-carbon-debut-evo">Pro-ject Debut Carbon Evo </a>though, which we rate as our favorite turntable currently.</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><hr /><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipPxwjpcVMy6NGxJygsFe9.jpg" alt="the pro-ject debut carbon evo turntable" /></div></figure></div><p><em></em><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

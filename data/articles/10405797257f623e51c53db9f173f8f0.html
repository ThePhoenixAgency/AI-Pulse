Koeltl of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70317331/bprotocol-foundation-v-universal-navigation-inc/" target="_blank">granted</a> the defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint filed by Bprotocol Foundation and LocalCoin Ltd. against Universal Navigation Inc. and the Uniswap Foundation. </p><p>The court found that the patents are directed to the abstract idea of calculating crypto exchange rates and therefore fail the two-step test for patent eligibility established by the US Supreme Court. </p><p>The ruling marks a procedural win for Uniswap, but it is not final. The case was dismissed without prejudice, giving the plaintiffs 21 days to file an amended complaint. If no amended complaint is filed, the dismissal will convert to one with prejudice.</p><p>Shortly after the ruling, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams <a href="https://x.com/haydenzadams/status/2021412521111060626" target="_blank">wrote</a> on X, “A lawyer just told me we won.”</p><p>“Uniswap Labs has always been proud to build in public — it’s a core value of DeFi,” a Uniswap Labs spokesperson told Cointelegraph. “We’re pleased that the court recognized that this lawsuit was meritless.”</p><figure>    <img alt="Law, Patents, United States, Bancor, DeFi, Uniswap, DEX" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c5747-e715-7017-a100-3b6448f5066a.jpg" /><figcaption><em>Source: </em><a href="https://x.com/haydenzadams/status/2021412521111060626" target="_blank"><em>Hayden Adams</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Bprotocol Foundation for comment but had not received a response by publication.</p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-dismisses-bancor-patent-case-uniswap-abstract-ideas"><strong>Continue reading</strong></a></p><h2>Binance completes $1 billion Bitcoin conversion for SAFU emergency fund</h2><p>Binance completed the $1 billion Bitcoin conversion for its emergency fund, committing to holding Bitcoin as its core reserve asset.</p><p>Binance purchased another $304 million worth of Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) on Thursday, completing the conversion of $1 billion in Bitcoin for its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) wallet, <a href="https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/address/1BAuq7Vho2CEkVkUxbfU26LhwQjbCmWQkD" target="_blank">according </a>to Arkham data.</p><p>The fund now holds 15,000 Bitcoin, worth over $1 billion, acquired at an average aggregate cost basis of $67,000 per coin, Binance said in a Thursday X <a href="https://x.com/binance/status/2021840377104527724" target="_blank">post</a>.</p><p> “With SAFU Fund now fully in Bitcoin, we reinforce our belief in BTC as the premier long-term reserve asset.”</p><p>The last tranche of BTC came three days after <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-buys-bitcoin-safu-reserve-market-dip">Binance’s previous $300 million</a> acquisition on Monday.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c5747-e8f1-7e95-9549-05dd47847f06.png" /><figcaption><em>Binance SAFU Fund wallet.

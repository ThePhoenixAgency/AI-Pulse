  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>Although much attention will be given to the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, it is the “arsenal of war” that Donald Trump has assembled in the Middle East, and what it implies for the stately pace of Washington’s negotiations with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>, that deserves more.</p><p>The well-connected Axios reporter Barak Ravid is hated in Iran – one news site on Thursday described him as a one-man psychological war operation against Tehran. But he is widely read, as was his report that the US viewed the talks in Geneva on Tuesday as a “nothing burger”, and that a full-scale attack on Iran was far closer than most Americans realised. The story led to a spike in oil prices and front-page pieces in US newspapers saying Trump’s military preparations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/18/trump-iran-us-military-reports">would be complete by the weekend</a>.</p><p>Inevitably the story, along with the armada, could be seen as another part of coercive diplomacy. The Trump team’s modus operandi often seems to be to “speak softly [to Axios] and carry a big stick”.</p><p>Either way, Iran may claim it will not negotiate under duress – but that is precisely what it is being required to do.</p><p>It has prompted the Iranian diplomatic class to push back against the claim that it is playing for time by insisting on indirect talks and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/17/iran-us-nuclear-talks-open-geneva">drafting “guiding principles”</a> to be discussed at another meeting in a fortnight – or that the talks have not moved beyond generalities.</p><p>The Iranian foreign ministry said that, on the contrary, Tehran’s team had been willing to stay in Geneva for days to continue the discussions but it had been Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who had foreshortened the talks because they needed to go to another venue to negotiate with Ukraine and Russia.</p><p>For good measure Tehran pointed out that the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, had been on the phone to the UN nuclear weapons inspector, Raphael Grossi, to discuss details of how the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be able to visit Iran’s nuclear sites to verify what remained and to oversee the dilution of its 400kg stockpile of uranium, now enriched to more than 60%.</p><p>Grossi sounded optimistic. “There has been some progress, but there is still a lot of work to be done, and the problem is that we don’t have much time,” he said. “It’s possible to have a dialogue that is really strengthening for the first time … We’re talking about specific issues and actions that we need to take.”</p><figure><div><img alt="Head and shoulders of Abbas Araghchi" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c742fd282d5b179395c1c49727584e0b1c125d/387_0_6633_5310/master/6633.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi.</span> Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/AP</figcaption></figure><p>He said he sensed a desire on both sides to reach an agreement, but that doing so would be “extremely complex”.</p><p>The outlines of the agreement are in view, even if Iran, still behaving as if it were involved in a traditional negotiation, is reluctant to spell out in public what concessions it is prepared to make.</p><p>Its offer at heart is to suspend domestic uranium enrichment for a fixed period as long as five years, and downgrade its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% to 3-6%. The 2015 nuclear agreement required a 15-year suspension, and for Iran to keep its uranium stockpile under 300kg enriched to a maximum of 3.67%.</p><p>The suspension offer is in part an acknowledgment of the reality that Tehran currently has working centrifuges to enrich uranium, and it would insist on retaining its right to enrich for civilian purposes as a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.</p><p>Iran is prepared to allow the IAEA back, even though it feels Grossi betrayed the agency’s neutrality by never condemning the US attacks on its nuclear facilities, despite their being under IAEA safeguards at the time.</p><p>In an interview in Saudi Arabia, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said: “I am convinced that if the normal work of IAEA inspectors, as mandated by its founding documents, is restored, the Iranian side will certainly cooperate with them.” He made no mention of Iran’s excess stockpile being sent to Russia, an offer Moscow has frequently made.</p><p>In return for suspension, Tehran is seeking the return of its frozen assets – estimates vary on the size – and the lifting of sanctions on banking and oil exports. A grand offer of a US economic partnership and wider access to Iranian markets has also been made, which could be the most novel part of the draft agreement and is loosely modelled on what Ukraine has offered the US.</p><figure></figure><p>Trump’s difficulty in running with Iran’s offer is threefold. It bears a striking resemblance to the 2015 nuclear deal that he derided and abandoned in 2018. It allows Tehran in principle to enrich domestically, and it contains nothing about limiting the range of its ballistic missile programme, a key Israeli demand. It would look as if he was repairing the wreckage he caused in his first term.</p><p>Second, he would be giving succour to an Iranian regime that is at its weakest and most unpopular since the 1979 revolution, after assembling the largest US naval buildup in the Middle East since the start of the Iraq war in 2003.</p><p>Third, he would make the Grand Old Duke of York look decisive, and after the Greenland fiasco his credibility is low.</p><p>Omid Memarian, a senior Iran analyst at Dawn, a Washington thinktank focused on the Middle East, said Tehran was overplaying its cards and was not in as strong a position as last June.</p><p>“The calculus of the military establishment is very different to ordinary Iranians,” he said. “They have a legitimacy crisis and lost a massive amount of their ability to deter outside attacks, but they think a US attack will rally their loyalists around the flag as it did last June, and that will give them an excuse to deal harshly with internal dissent. That is why they are giving so little in the negotiations.</p><p>“They know this is going to be an existential threat and a much bigger US attack, but they do not think it can bring the regime to its knees, and that they can survive it.</p><p>“Ali Khamenei’s tactics are to keep the base intact and energised, but we are starting to see cracks in the regime, and an external attack may provide more space for those criticising the regime in which to move. There is a lot of frustration with him amongst his inner circle.”</p></div></div>

High-profile examples—from leaked entertainment setlists to geopolitical developments—have underscored the risk of information asymmetry.</p><p>“Insider information is not okay,” Sarmad said, noting that blockchain transparency can make suspicious wallets visible. Still, Dillinger acknowledged enforcement limits. “There’s always going to be some loopholes that people will find.”</p><p>As trading volumes rise and regulators take notice, founders agreed that surveillance tools, clearer disclosure norms and stronger platform governance will determine whether prediction markets mature into a recognized financial category—or remain viewed as speculative betting.</p></div><div><p><span>AI Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethics">our standards</a>. <span>For more information, see </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2023/04/14/how-coindesk-will-use-generative-ai-tools">CoinDesk's full AI Policy</a>.</p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>Metaplanet operating profit to rise 81% in 2026 after soaring 17-fold last year on options writing</p><div><p>55 minutes ago</p></div><figure><img alt="Stock market price charts (Anne Nygård/Unsplash)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F0ce20daadee6a2147c8807b254e696396e6f268d-1920x1080.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" /></figure><p>The company recorded a non-cash bitcoin valuation loss of 102.2 billion yen ($650 million) due to the cryptocurrency’s price drop.</p><div><p>What to know: </p><div><ul><li>Metaplanet reported a 17-fold increase in operating profit to 6.28 billion yen ($40.8 million) and a 738% rise in revenue.</li><li>Operating profit is forecast to rise 81% this year.</li><li>The company recorded a non-cash bitcoin valuation loss of 102.2 billion yen ($650 million) due to the cryptocurrency’s price drop.</li></ul></div></div><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/02/16/metaplanet-operating-profit-to-rise-81-in-2026-after-soaring-17-fold-last-year-on-options-writing">Read full story</a></p></div></div></div>

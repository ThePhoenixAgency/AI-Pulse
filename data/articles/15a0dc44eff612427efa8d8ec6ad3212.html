<p>Apple’s upcoming product launches in the next several weeks are set to shift the company out of its slow start to the year and into a busy hardware cycle that focuses heavily on the Mac lineup, while also bringing updates to the iPhone and iPad families. Multiple new Macs, refreshed notebooks, and at least one new display are preparing to debut, and at the same time, Apple is lining up an entry-level iPhone and updated iPads to round out the push.</p>



<p>The biggest movement will happen on the Mac side, where Apple plans to introduce a new low-cost MacBook powered by the A18 Pro chip, along with refreshed MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models based on the M5 family. In addition, the company is working on new Mac displays that promise better picture quality and a higher refresh rate, which signals a broader upgrade cycle for desktop and portable Mac users.</p>



<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023091274736365848">reports</a> that Apple will unveil multiple new Macs and Mac-related hardware “over the course of the next several weeks.” He also said, “I’m expecting this low cost MacBook, new MacBook Airs, new MacBook Pros, new Mac displays over the course of the next several weeks,” and added that Apple is “preparing for an event that month.”</p>



<h2>New Macs Lead the Upcoming Product Launches</h2>



<p>The new low-cost MacBook will reportedly feature a display slightly smaller than 13 inches and come in a range of colors, and it will use a new aluminum manufacturing process. Gurman <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023020432811819330">described</a> it as Apple’s “incoming low-cost MacBook” that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-low-cost-macbook-colors-tipped-ahead-of-possible-march-launch/">will arrive</a> in “a slew of fun colors.”</p>



<p>Apple is also preparing:</p>



<ul>
<li>New<strong> M5 MacBook Air models</strong>, expected to focus mainly on internal upgrades</li>



<li>New <strong>M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro</strong> models, following the base M5 version released last fall</li>



<li>At least one <strong>new external Mac display</strong> with improved picture quality and a higher refresh rate</li>
</ul>

<p>Gurman <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/new-macbook-pro-release-date-now-linked-to-macos-tahoe-26-3-update/">previously said</a> the MacBook Pro updates are “slated for as early as the week of March 2,” tying the launch window to the macOS 26.3 cycle.</p>



<h2>iPhone 17e and New iPads Also Coming Soon</h2>



<p>Beyond Macs, Apple plans to introduce the iPhone 17e, a new base model iPad, and an updated iPad Air powered by the M4 chip. Gurman noted, “The other <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/iphone-17e-imminent-as-apple-employees-report-iphone-16e-stock-dried-out/">imminent stuff – iPhone 17e</a>, new entry level iPad and the iPad Air,” and <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023091274736365848">clarified</a> that he is “not expecting a new iPad Pro for a while.”</p>



<p>He also <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023093207547224190">pointed out</a> that there is more in store later this year, including a new Mac Studio, iMac, and Mac mini, calling it a “Huge year for the Mac.”</p>



<p>Taken together, these upcoming product launches in next several weeks show Apple preparing for one of its most active hardware stretches of the year, with Macs leading the charge and iPhone and iPad updates close behind.</p>

    <div><div><p>A Beijing pastry shop visited by the Chinese president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a>, on a lunar new year tour this week has been swarmed by customers hoping to get their hands on Xi-approved sweet treats.</p><p>Traffic was brought to a standstill in Beijing’s capital as the president took a tour around the city on Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>As well as visiting technology parks and business leaders, Xi dropped by a Chinese new year market in central Beijing’s Dongcheng district. The nine-day celebrations, the biggest holiday in China’s calendar, officially start on Sunday.</p><p>While at the festive market, Xi picked up a 45 yuan (£4.79) bundle of delicacies from Daoxiangcun, a historic bakery known for its traditional snacks.</p><p>According to the shopkeeper interviewed by Chinese media, Xi plumped for three items: honey-glazed dough twists, cream-filled dough twists and jujube flower pastries, a flakey, flower-shaped cookie with a filling made from red dates. Dough twists are made from fried pastry and are a popular local snack in Beijing.</p><p>The shop has since been overrun by shoppers keen to get a slice of the Xi-approved pies.</p><p>One customer, Zhao, bought 16 bags of the snacks, which are now being pre-packaged into Xi-themed triples. She told a reporter: “These are the same new year’s goods recommended by the general secretary, and people really like them. I want to buy some to give to my friends.”</p><figure><div><img alt="Customers line up to buy snacks at a Daoxiangcun store in Beijing" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42dbf43f33c3ba6ccc4d78e4a0698952373a7318/0_0_5633_3755/master/5633.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>The shop has since been overrun by shoppers keen to get a slice of the Xi-approved pies.</span> Photograph: Xinhua/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure><p>Xi is the general secretary of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), as well as being China’s president and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/13/cia-publishes-recruitment-video-disaffected-chinese-soldiers">commander of the armed forces</a>.</p><p>Daoxiangcun said its stores had to restock pastries to accommodate hungry and patriotic customers.</p><p>Xi also visited a store called Yili Bakery and bought a 14 yuan loaf of fruit bread. He reportedly said that he had enjoyed Yili’s butter rolls as a child in Beijing’s hutongs, the traditional alleyways that crisscross the capital’s historic centre.</p><p>Xi’s personal tastes have often inspired imitations. In 2022, there was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/07/world/asia/china-communist-cadre-fashion.html">viral trend</a> among young people on social media of wearing “office and bureau style clothes”, ie the plain attire of a CCP bureaucrat, a tongue-in-cheek homage to the CCP’s highest-ranking cadre, the general secretary.</p><p><em>Additional research by Lillian Yang</em></p></div></div>

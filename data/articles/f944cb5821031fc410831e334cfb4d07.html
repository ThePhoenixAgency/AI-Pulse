He remains in custody – though his whereabouts are unclear – as police search addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk.</p><p>The arrest appears <strong>related to his conduct as a UK trade envoy</strong> and follows the <strong>disclosure of emails related to Epstein.</strong></p><p>Among the files <strong>released by the US Department of Justice</strong> were documents that appeared to show the former prince <strong>forwarding sensitive government documents and commercial information</strong> to the convicted sex offender.</p><p>In 2010, he appears to have forwarded government reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore and China to Epstein, according to the recently published files.</p><p>The documents also appeared to show that Andrew forwarded Epstein information on investment opportunities in gold and uranium in Afghanistan.</p><p>Andrew served as a UK trade envoy between 2001 and 2011. Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial or political information about their official visits.</p><p>Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein and rejected any suggestion he used his time as trade envoy to further his own interests.</p></article><article><header></header><p>The SNP’s Westminster leader <strong>Stephen Flynn</strong> described the arrest of <strong>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor</strong> as a “very serious development”.</p><p>The SNP MP said:</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markIt underlines why it was a bad misjudgment for Keir Starmer to block Parliament from debating action against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor as recently as October.</p> <p>The former prince should have been stripped of his titles and roles as quickly as possible - it was a mistake for the Labour government to delay action.</p>
</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, also in Scotland, the former first minister <strong>Humza Yousaf</strong> credited the victims of Jeffrey Epstein - including <strong>Virginia Giuffre</strong> - for bringing “scrutiny”.</p><p>Writing on X, Yousaf said:</p><blockquote> <p>double quotation markDue process matters but so does accountability. For far too long, wealth, titles and status have protected men.</p> <p>It is down to the bravery of Epstein’s victims, like Virginia Giuffre, that there is some scrutiny on those who associated with him. Let’s hope there’s also justice.</p>

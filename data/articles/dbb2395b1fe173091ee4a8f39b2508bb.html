  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <p>Set in a secluded community retreat that uses various therapeutic techniques to try and rehabilitate its residents, ABIDE certainly looks to be different.</p>
<p>At the core of ABIDE is an an eccentric cast of criminals, creeps and lost souls all needing some sort of rehabilitation. During the game you choose who to spend time with to earn their trust to unlock various mysteries. Split between a day / night cycle of building relationships and doing tasks during the day, to full blown terror during the night as you venture into forbidden places full of real and imagined horrors.</p>
<p>The developers note that since it features "potentially triggering and sensitive subject matter" they've "consulted with clinical therapists throughout the pre-production process to ensure the game gets things right".</p>
<p>Check out the weird trailer below:</p> <p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A gory, mysterious and contemporary tale of terror inspired by giallo fiction, splatterpunk novels, Ken Currie paintings, East Asian and low-fi horror cinema.</li>
<li>Handcrafted, stop-motion visuals lend a unique, uncanny and uncomfortable tone to St Boniface.</li>
<li>Bespoke Day/Night Gameplay which sees players build relationships and investigate by day, then sneak, spy and survive the horrors of the night.</li>
<li>A varied cast of criminals, creeps and lost souls lie at the heart of the game, each with their own secrets and dark, depraved mysteries to unearth.</li>
<li>Original soundtrack featuring original compositions, analogue samples and talented vocalists compliment diegetic sounds to ratchet up the tension.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the press release: </p>
<p>“We can't make this without your support. Horror seems to be under pressure from censorship, some subtle and some blatant. Sites are delisting mature rated games and recently a horror game was taken off some of the biggest marketplaces. Having a game like this funded by a community means that it can be made without compromise.” said Talha Kaya.</p>
<p>“All the dolls are made. All the models are scanned in. The stories are written, the voice actors have been contacted and the first lines have even been recorded. We have a detailed and robust design document outlining the structure and its twists and turns. We need time to pull it all together and we need time to dream and explore and make the best possible game we can.” added Jack King-Spooner.</p>
<p>You can follow it and help <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/637042083/abide/description" target="_blank">fund it on Kickstarter</a>. They need at lwast £25,000 by February 28th and currently have little over £15,000 in funding so it needs a bit of a push if their third game is going to be a success.</p> <p><span>Article taken from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/">GamingOnLinux.com.</a></span> </p></div></div>

  <div class="content"><p>(Image credit: Best Buy / Amazon edited by Gemini) I love Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I've been playing for 12 years, and the way I play the game has changed over time – and so has my Dungeon Mastering toolkit. I've now got a cadre of go-to gadgets and tools I use pretty much every session, either during my preparation or play. As luck would have it, there are plenty of Presidents' Day Sales on them right now.My main tools are centered around organisation and music. My trusty Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Lite has an 'Open in Split-Screen view' mode I use all the time: on one screen is a document with my session notes, on another is a blank Notes page I can write on with my stylus as I go. The Tab S10 Lite is currently $70 off at Amazon right now. Apple users will want a similarly-sized 11-inch iPad with A16 chip instead, which comes with a hefty 128GB of storage and $50 off, so it's $299 compared to the Samsung's $279.14 D&amp;D gadgets picked by an expert DMMore of today's best Presidents' Day salesAmazon: 45% off TVs, AirPods, air fryers &amp; vacuumsApple: iPads, AirPods &amp; MacBooks from $99Best Buy: $1,000 off TVs, laptops &amp; headphonesDell: laptop deals from $249.99Home Depot: 40% off appliances, furniture, grills &amp; toolsLenovo: 45% off laptops &amp; tabletsLowe's: up to 40% off appliances, furniture &amp; toolsSamsung: up to $2,000 off appliances, TVs &amp; phonesTarget: 40% off clothing, tech &amp; furnitureWalmart: furniture, cheap TVs &amp; vacs from $69Wayfair: 54% off furniture, rugs &amp; decor Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

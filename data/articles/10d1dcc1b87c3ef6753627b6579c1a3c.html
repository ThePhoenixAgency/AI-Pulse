Microsoft is in hot water again as regulators check if its Jumpstart program nudges PC makers to favor Edge over other browsers. Usama Jawad Neowin @UsamaJawad96 · Feb 13, 2026 13:49 EST Microsoft has often found itself in the crosshairs of regulators and competitors when it comes to its Windows operating system. Recently, the Browser Choice Alliance accused the Redmond tech giant of bribing customers to use Microsoft Edge. Now, it is the target of scrutiny once again in a related area. Brazil's antitrust regulator, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), is probing 10 major PC manufacturers in the area based on Opera's complaint that Microsoft indirectly forces OEMs to exclusively pre-install Edge on Windows PCs. Multiple OEMs have received regulatory letters, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, Acer, Positivo, Samsung, Multilaser, Daten, and LG. In the regulator's letter seen by Neowin, OEMs have been questioned about their participation in Microsoft's "Jumpstart" program, which requires them to exclusively pre-install Edge on Windows PCs. CADE wants to know how many PCs each vendor sold between 2020 and 2025, categorized by operating system. It wants granular details too, such as the number of PCs sold under the Jumpstart program versus those sold outside of it, along with figures related to how many were sold with the "Windows in S mode" configuration, which only allowed users to download and use apps from the Microsoft Store. CADE has demanded details of the contract and commercial negotiations between Microsoft and OEMs as well, such as penalties associated with non-compliance with the Jumpstart program, and if Redmond gave OEMs room for negotiations or just offered the contract as a "take-it-or-leave-it" document. Some other pertinent questions asked by CADE are referenced below, machine-translated from Portuguese: For computers running Windows that are part of the Jumpstart Program, specify which types of third-party software—including, but not limited to, browsers—can be preinstalled and the conditions for preinstalling such software. For computers running Windows that are part of the Jumpstart Program, specify which types of third-party software—including, but not limited to, browsers—cannot be pre-installed and the respective regulations prohibiting the pre-installation of such software. To the best of your company's knowledge, what would be the expected financial and/or commercial impact in the event of withdrawal from/termination of the Jumpstart Program? Justify your answer. In a statement to Neowin, the Browser Choice Alliance (which consists of BrowserWorks, Google Chrome, Midori, Vivaldi, Wavebox, and Opera) has welcomed this probe, noting that: The Browser Choice Alliance (BCA) welcomes CADE's 12 February 2026 action in its antitrust probe into Microsoft's global practices. CADE has issued information requests to major Windows PC manufacturers, including Dell, HP, and Lenovo, regarding Microsoft’s "Jumpstart Program”, which pre-installs Edge and restricts third-party browsers. The investigation follows Opera's formal complaint and aims to assess the effects of Microsoft’s practices on competition and consumer choice in the PC browser market. This marks a significant step towards addressing anti-competitive behaviors that restrict consumer choice and harm fair market competition. The BCA views CADE’s RFIs as a natural and constructive step in the investigative process, encouraging broader stakeholder participation and the open sharing of relevant information and perspectives. In this context, BCA encourages stakeholders to present evidence and relevant data in this important case, which has significant implications for competition both globally and in Brazil, in order to ensure a comprehensive and well-informed review of the matter by CADE. It'll be interesting to see how Microsoft handles this situation when the time comes, but it seems like the company is facing a rather uphill battle ahead if the claims made regarding the Jumpstart program are indeed true.</code></pre>

<p>The England vs Scotland T20 World Cup 2026 match could very well be a virtual knockout. Unfortunately for English fans, that’s because Harry Brook’s side has had a bumpy start to their campaign. Despite looking strong on paper, they only managed a narrow escape against Nepal in their opener, thanks to Sam Curran defending 10 runs in the final over. The West Indies weren’t as forgiving, however, and handed England a 30-run defeat.</p><p>If you're away from home right now you can <a href="http://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=564&amp;url_id=10992&amp;aff_id=3013&amp;aff_click_id=trd-us-1322568738092834234&amp;aff_sub2=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fhow-to-watch%2Fcricket%2Fengland-vs-scotland-t20-world-cup-2026-free" target="_blank"><strong>use a VPN to unblock your usual stream from anywhere</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Like England, Scotland have played two matches, with one win and one loss. They fell to the Windies in their opener but bounced back strongly against newcomers Italy. They currently sit above England in the table due to a better net run rate – so a win here will put them on the brink of history, as they’d have one foot in the Super 8 stage.</p><p>The match will be played at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. This works in Scotland’s favor, as both of their games so far have been at the same venue, helping them acclimatize to the conditions. England, meanwhile, will be playing away from the Wankhede for the first time in this World Cup. However, Kolkata’s batting-friendly surface could be exactly what England is looking for if they hope to go all the way.</p><p>Keep reading as we explain how to watch the England vs Scotland in the T20 World Cup from anywhere in the world.</p>

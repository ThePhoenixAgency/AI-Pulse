The platform allows users to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/defi-lending-and-borrowing-explained">lend and borrow crypto</a> across multiple blockchains, and the AAVE token can be staked to earn yield.</p><h2>Grayscale joins Bitwise in Aave ETF race</h2><p>With its filing, Grayscale is the second to seek US regulatory approval for an ETF tied to Aave (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/aave-price-index">AAVE</a>), currently joining only Bitwise in looking to launch a similar fund.</p><p>Bitwise <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitwise-files-11-strategy-crypto-etfs">filed with the SEC</a> in December to launch the Bitwise AAVE Strategy ETF, among a slew of filings that sought to create ETFs tied to popular altcoins, including Uniswap (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/uniswap-price-index">UNI</a>) and Zcash (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/zec-price-index">ZEC</a>).</p><p>Bitwise’s ETF plans to hold up to 60% of its assets directly in AAVE tokens and at least 40% in securities, such as other ETFs that are exposed to AAVE, while Grayscale’s would hold AAVE tokens directly.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/roundhill-investments-event-contracts-prediction-markets-etf-united-states-election"><em><strong>Roundhill’s election prediction ETFs are ‘potentially groundbreaking': Analyst</strong></em></a></p><p>The two ETFs are set to be the first in the US to offer direct exposure to Aave, joining a short list of overseas products that have launched to track the token.</p><p>In Europe, 21Shares <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/21shares-six-crypto-etps-nasdaq-stockholm-aave-chainlink">launched an Aave</a> exchange-traded product on the Nasdaq Stockholm in November, several years after Global X launched a similar Aave product in Germany in early 2023.</p><p>The AAVE token has traded down 1.6% over the past day to $126 and is more than 80% off its all-time high of nearly $662, reached in May 2021 amid a bull market for altcoins, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aave" target="_blank">according</a> to CoinGecko.</p><p><em><strong>Magazine: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/vechain-sunny-lu-bitcoin-beginnings-blockchain-founder-cointelegraph/"><em><strong>Getting scammed for 100 Bitcoin led Sunny Lu to create VeChain</strong></em></a></p></div><p>Cointelegraph is committed to independent, transparent journalism.

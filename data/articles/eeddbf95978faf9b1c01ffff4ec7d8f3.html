Yorkville also filed for a second product, the Truth Social Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF, which would invest in and stake <span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/cronos"><span><span><span>CRO</span><span></span><span>$0.08235</span></span></span></a></span>, the native token of Crypto.com’s <a href="https://cronos.org/" target="_blank">Cronos blockchain</a>.</p><p>While both ETFs remain subject to SEC approval, the filings mark an significant next step for the politically branded investment firm. If approved, the ETFs would be launched in partnership with Crypto.com, which is expected to serve as the digital asset custodian, liquidity provider, and staking services provider for the new funds.</p><p>The Cronos-focused ETF is especially notable for its inclusion of staking rewards, which are typically earned by helping to secure proof-of-stake networks like Cronos. That could position the fund as a yield-generating product in a space still largely dominated by passive spot ETFs.</p><p>Both funds would also be distributed through Foris Capital US LLC, the SEC-registered broker-dealer affiliated with Crypto.com.</p><p>Truth Social first signaled its crypto ambitions in June 2025, when it filed an S-1 registration statement for a spot bitcoin ETF under the same brand. That was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/08/trump-linked-truth-social-plans-crypto-etf-as-digital-asset-franchise-expands">followed</a> by a Blue Chip Digital Asset ETF filing in July 2025, targeting a basket of large-cap altcoins.

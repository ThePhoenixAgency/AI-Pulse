						<p>THQ Nordic have just revealed that the Gothic 1 Remake is now set for release on June 5th. Bringing the original game from 2001 up to more modern standards in terms of gameplay and graphics.</p>
<p>I'll admit this is another I missed the boat on original, as I never played it so I'm keen to hear from you in the comments if you're excited for this one. Hopefully it will be a nice hit, as remakes don't always live up to expectations. And of course, here's to hoping it also works fine in Proton on Linux systems.</p>
<p>Speaking about it the developers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gothic 1 Remake's primary objective has always been to recreate that raw, unforgettable magic of the original – the gritty camp vibes, the living open-world, the rough language, the unforgiving wilderness, and that nameless, no-hero outsider feel that made Gothic a cult legend 25 years ago. The developers at Alkimia Interactive poured endless hours into tweaking every detail: faces that scream "Old Camp thug," voices with that perfect throaty rasp for each character, features that hit just right while feeling modern without losing the grit.</p>
<p>This project was never about slapping together "good enough" – it's about making it look and feel "Gothic" in every corner of the world. And this could only be achieved through way more iterations than your average project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Faithful Remake: Experience the original 2001 RPG classic fully rebuilt using current gen technology, preserving its iconic atmosphere while enhancing the gameplay for a fluid and dynamic experience.</li>
<li>Expansive Gameplay: Immerse yourself in over 50 hours of gameplay, exploring the vast and dangerous world of the Colony. Discover secrets old and new, challenging combat encounters, and unique NPCs each with their own story to tell</li>
<li>Dynamic Living World: Explore a vibrant world where inhabitants go about their daily lives: working, sleeping, eating, and fighting to survive, adding depth and realism to this immersive world.</li>
<li>Branching Story: Chose which of the three factions to align with, influencing how your abilities and playstyle develop and how this true adventure unfolds.</li>
<li>Enhanced Combat System: Master a modernized combat system that updates the core mechanics of the original, offering a more fluid and dynamic experience while staying true to its deliberate and tactical roots.</li>
<li>Play as the Nameless Hero: Navigate the fate of a lifelong convict who must survive in a treacherous world filled with wild animals, ancient magic, and dangerous foes.</li>
</ul>

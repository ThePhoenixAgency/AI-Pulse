    <div><div><p>Three firefighters pulled a man’s body from the mud amid the rubble of houses swept away in a landslide in south-eastern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil">Brazil</a>, where 30 people died and 39 were still missing on Tuesday after torrential rains.</p><p>A river in the state of Minas Gerais burst its banks and streets became raging currents of brown water after an overnight downpour in a region that has seen record rain this month.</p><p>State firefighters said 30 people had died in the cities of Juiz de Fora and Ubá. More than 200 people have been rescued.</p><p>Firefighters and search dogs worked to find 39 people still missing in the debris.</p><p>Twelve houses in a hillside neighbourhood of Juiz de Fora had been swept away in a “massive landslide”, Maj Demetrius Goulart of the fire brigade told AFP.</p><p>“Many people were inside their homes at night when it was raining,” he said.</p><p>Wilton Aparecido de Souza sobbed as he spoke of his 20-year-old son trapped in the debris.</p><p>“He was a good boy, he had just finished his military service and he wanted to buy a motorcycle,” the 42-year-old told AFP.</p><p>“At least find his body, so I can give him a proper burial.”</p><p>Silence hung heavy over dozens of onlookers in the rare moments the excavators’ engines stopped, broken only by the barking of a panicked dog.</p><p>“Almost everyone buried in this mud is family; there’s my sister, my niece,” said Cleiton Ronan, a 32-year-old warehouse worker.</p><p>Earlier, Goulart said a boy aged about 10 had been pulled alive from the rubble after a two-hour rescue effort. Many expressed hope that their loved ones would still be found alive.</p><p>But, said Paulo Roberto Bermudes Rezende, a state civil defence coordinator, “the longer it goes on, the slimmer the chances of finding survivors become”.</p><p>Volunteers with shovels came to help the firefighters.</p><p>Atila Mauro, a 33-year-old bricklayer, said: “When I dug up children’s belongings – balloons, teddy bears – it broke my heart. I’m a father too … I’m trying to help however I can.”</p><p>The state fire brigade said the rainfall had led to flooding and landslides, while images shared on social media showed buildings collapsing.</p><p>Juiz de Fora’s mayor, Margarida Salomão, has declared a state of emergency.</p><p>Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, wrote on X: “Our focus is to guarantee humanitarian assistance, the restoration of basic services, aid to displaced people, and support for reconstruction.”</p><p>Salomão said her municipality of little more than 500,000 people was experiencing its wettest February on record, with 584mm (23in) of accumulated rainfall.</p><p>Some neighbourhoods were isolated, with at least 20 landslides, Salomão said, adding that the situation was “extreme”.</p><p>Her office said that an estimated 440 people had had to leave their homes and were receiving support for temporary shelter.</p><p>State authorities suspended classes in all municipal schools.</p><p>Brazil has suffered various tragedies in recent years due to extreme weather events ranging from floods to drought and intense heatwaves.</p><p>In 2024, more than 200 people died and two million were affected by unprecedented flooding in southern Brazil, one of the worst natural disasters in the country’s history.</p><p>Two years earlier, a deluge in the city of Petrópolis outside Rio de Janeiro left 241 people dead.</p><p>Experts have linked most of these events to the effects of the climate crisis.</p></div></div>

  <h1>iOS 26.4 has iPhone Stolen Device Protection on by default</h1>

  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <p>Three years after the feature rolled out, Apple is automatically enabling Stolen Device Protection in iOS 26.4, expanding safeguards against an ever-expanding epidemic of iPhone theft.
</p><p>In 2023, Apple rolled out a new feature called Stolen Device Protection. The feature is designed to prevent iPhones from being accessed if a thief manages to both learn a user's passcode and steal their iPhone. </p><p>This was a crucial change, as more and more reports rolled in, showing that this type of theft was on the rise. An experienced thief could easily access a user's list of passwords, access bank accounts, and disable safety features such as <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/find-my">Find My</a> and Trusted Devices.
</p><p>Previously, the feature was disabled by default, and users would need to enable it <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/01/23/how-to-use-stolen-device-protection">via settings.</a> But that's about to change.
</p><p>Apple will be opting all users into Stolen Device Protection in iOS 26.4. If you haven't used it yet, here's what you need to know about it.
</p><h2>How Stolen Device Protection works</h2><p>When Stolen Device Protection is enabled, the following requires biometric authentication with no passcode fallback:
</p><ul>
<li>Using passwords or passkeys saved in Apple Passwords</li>
<li>Applying for a new Apple Card</li>
<li>Viewing the Apple Card virtual card</li>
<li>Turning off Lost Mode
</li><li>Erasing all content and settings</li>
<li>Take certain Apple Cash and Savings actions in Wallet</li>
<li>Using payment methods saved in Safari</li>
<li>Using your iPhone to set up a new device</li>
</ul><p>That means a thief with your iPhone and passcode could not access these settings. Any one of these settings could lead to significant financial loss or compromise of the user's Apple ID.
</p><p>Features not mentioned in the above list will still have a passcode fallback option, like authenticating <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-pay">Apple Pay</a>. However, FDIC insurance will cover fraudulent charges if a thief uses Apple Pay.

The first explains the one-hour delay, the second shows a countdown timer."></a></p><p><span>Stolen Device Protection one-hour delay</span></p></div><p>Apple adds another layer of protection for especially sensitive settings and controls — a one-hour delay. If the user is outside of a trusted location and attempts to alter the following settings, a biometric scan followed by an hour delay and another biometric scan occurs.
</p><ul><li>Changing your Apple ID password</li>
<li>Updating Apple ID account security settings, like removing a trusted device, trusted phone number, Recovery Key, or Recovery Contact</li>
<li>Changing your iPhone passcode</li>
<li>Adding or removing Face ID or <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/touch-id">Touch ID</a></li>
<li>Turning off Find My</li>
<li>Turning off Stolen Device Protection</li></ul><p>Trusted locations are learned by the iPhone and are not user-addressable. Significant locations such as home and work are used as exemptions for Stolen Device Protection.
</p><h2>How to disable Stolen Device Protection</h2><p>Disabling the feature can be done through Settings, but if you attempt to do so outside of a trusted location, it will trigger an hour-long delay between biometric scans.
</p><ul><li>Open the Settings app and tap on "Face ID &amp; Passcode"</li>
<li>The toggle for Stolen Device Protection is about midway down the page</li>
<li>Toggle the feature off</li></ul><p>However, as we continue to pivot towards a fully digital ecosystem, <em>AppleInsider</em> highly recommends leaving the feature activated. Stolen Device Protection won't prevent your iPhone from being stolen, but it might keep your Apple ID, passwords, and finances safe from thieves.</p> </div></div>

"This movement wasn't just about bringing us together, but about bringing us together around a progressive agenda."</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c05b/live/6478dd40-8499-11ef-b7d7-93f6f51421df.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Jesse Jackson smiling at the camera with his hands clasped in front of him"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div></figure></div><div><p>A gifted orator, Jackson articulated the frustrations of those who felt like second-class citizens in the world's most prosperous democracy. His speech to the 1988 Democratic National Convention, which ended with the refrain "keep hope alive", would be echoed decades later in the "hope and change" slogan of Obama's successful 2008 presidential campaign.</p></div><div><p>After his historic run of presidential campaigns, Jackson went on to position himself as an elder statesman within the Democratic Party.</p></div><div><p>However, Jackson's later years would be punctuated by scandal, including revelations of marital infidelity and financial impropriety involving his son and political heir, Jesse Jackson Jr, who served as a congressman from Illinois.</p></div><div><p>In 2017, the elder Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and largely withdrew from public life. That diagnosis was subsequently changed to one of progressive supranuclear palsy, a degenerative brain disease with similar symptoms.</p></div><div><figure><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Jesse Jackson's life in civil rights, diplomacy, and politics</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Jackson was born Jesse Louis Burns on 8 October 1941 in Greenville, South Carolina - the son of 16-year-old Helen Burns. Unmarried, she was expelled from her local Baptist church after she became pregnant - the result of an affair with a 33-year-old married neighbour, Noah Robinson.</p></div><div><p>When Jackson was two, his mother married Charles Jackson, who went on to adopt his new stepson. Jesse Jackson remained in touch with Robinson, and regarded both men as his fathers.</p></div><div><p>Charles Jackson was a religious man, and his son was brought up in the church - a traditional focus for black political resistance since the time of American slavery.</p></div><div><p>Growing up in South Carolina, Jackson, like all black Americans, was segregated from his white neighbours. He was forced to attend separate schools and allowed only in designated areas in public places, like buses or restaurants.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5ebe/live/85549dc0-c0c9-11f0-a532-d129af550177.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images A black and white photo of Jesse Jackson as a young man"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jesse Jackson spoke for many black Americans who felt like second-class citizens</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/99cb/live/5df800b0-84a1-11ef-b7d7-93f6f51421df.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images A black and white photo of a young Jesse Jackson taking part in a march for jobs"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jackson led a major civil rights campaign before the age of 30</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p></p><h2>Martin Luther King's protege</h2><p></p></div><div><p>In high school, Jackson did well - being elected as class president and excelling in nearly every kind of team sport.</p></div><div><p>A football scholarship to the University of Illinois helped Jackson pursue his ambitions and escape his poor surroundings. But he soon transferred from the predominantly white institution to a historically black college in North Carolina.</p></div><div><p>He said he left Illinois because his white coaches wouldn't let him play quarterback in American football, although that account is disputed. Records show the team already had a black quarterback and Jackson was on academic probation.</p></div><div><p>As a student in North Carolina A&amp;T, Jackson gradually became involved with the civil rights movement. In 1960, he was arrested with seven other students after a silent demonstration in a whites-only public library, which led to the desegregation of the library.</p></div><div><p>Four years later, Jackson graduated and moved to Chicago, where he trained to become a religious leader and was noticed by King, the country's most famous civil rights leader.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b5ff/live/b547b1e0-0bef-11f1-b5e2-dd58fc65f0f6.jpg.webp" alt="AP Martin Luther King Jr, second from right, stands with Hosea Williams, left, Jesse Jackson, second from left, and Ralph Abernathy, right, on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, a day before he was assassinated at approximately the same place, April 3, 1968"><span>AP</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Martin Luther King Jr (second R) stands with Hosea Williams (L), Jesse Jackson (second L), and Ralph Abernathy (R) on the balcony of a Memphis hotel on 3 April 1968 - the day before King was assassinated</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/79ba/live/a759eaa0-c0ca-11f0-a532-d129af550177.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Black and white photo of Jackson sitting next to King and leaning over to him with his hand in the air.

The operation encouraged black men and women to frequent businesses that gave them basic courtesy and job opportunities, and to boycott those that did not. </p></div><div><p>Still in his 20s, Jackson was first asked to run the Chicago arm of the operation and, before long, to take on the national leadership.</p></div><div><p>In 1968, Jackson's life changed dramatically. He was with his mentor at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, when King was assassinated. Moments before the fatal shot, King was leaning over a railing in playful conversation with Jackson, who was standing in the parking lot below.</p></div><div><p>Jackson told reporters that he cradled King's head as he died - although other witnesses did not confirm that account. The next day, Jackson controversially appeared on television with his clothes still stained with King's blood, assuming the mantle of civil rights leadership.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3c85/live/00fbb4d0-84a9-11ef-8fff-0b75cefc5a9d.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Crowds after the assassination of Martin Luther King in Memphis.

The principal schism, he said, was between the haves and the have-nots.</p></div><div><p>"When we change the race problem into a class fight," he told the New York Times, "then we are going to have a new ball game."</p></div><div><p>Three years later, arguments over leadership led Operation Breadbasket to fracture and Jackson to form Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) - a new, wide-ranging civil rights group.</p></div><div><p>In the years that followed, Jackson became one of the most influential political figures in America.</p></div><div><p>His PUSH organisation championed inner-city education and affirmative action programmes that saw businesses employing black workers.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/47a1/live/ecd26bc0-84a8-11ef-8fff-0b75cefc5a9d.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Jesse Jackson greeting people in Washington at a rally"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jackson was determined that one bullet would not "kill the movement"</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p></p><h2>Presidential runs</h2><p></p></div><div><p>But he remained a controversial figure, with allegations that he had once made antisemitic remarks, and - as an ordained minister and the result of an unwanted pregnancy - he opposed abortion. </p></div><div><p>The issue was convulsing US politics after the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade. Democrats, who traditionally aligned with the civil rights movement, mostly supported keeping abortion legal.</p></div><div><p>"Human beings cannot give or create life by themselves, it is really a gift from God," he wrote in 1977. "Therefore, one does not have the right to take away that which he does not have the ability to give."</p></div><div><p>He suggested that Moses and Jesus would not have been born, had abortion been a possibility in biblical times.</p></div><div><p>In 1983, Jackson travelled to Syria to plead for the release of a captured American pilot, Lt Robert Goodman. His mission was successful, and greatly boosted his national profile.</p></div><div><p>With black youth unemployment running at around 50%, Jackson then announced a run for president.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c228/live/0ca0a5a0-84b0-11ef-8fff-0b75cefc5a9d.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Jesse Jackson campaigning in 1984 in front of a large sign which says &quot;president&quot;"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jackson ran for president in 1984</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>His decision caused heartache for some of his natural supporters, including King's widow, Coretta, who feared he would fail to win the Democratic Party's nomination and damage the chances of other progressive candidates.</p></div><div><p>During the campaign, Jackson spoke about the "rainbow coalition", a broad group of voters from a variety of races and beliefs who were traditionally disadvantaged and who, Jackson said, had been hurt by the policies of then-President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.</p></div><div><p>"Our flag is red, white, and blue, but our nation is a rainbow - red, yellow, brown, black, and white - and we're all precious in God's sight," he said in a speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, where he called for the party to unify.</p></div><div><p>Jackson copyrighted the term and later founded a political group with the same name. The move irritated some members of the Black Panther organisation, who in the 1960s had used the term to describe an alliance between activists groups in Chicago.</p></div><div><p>While Jackson ultimately lost the Democratic nomination, his campaign had become a political and cultural phenomenon. In October 1984, he hosted Saturday Night Live – a popular weekly network television comedy programme.</p></div><div><p>His presidential bid also had a profound effect on Democrats. By winning more than 3 million votes and coming third during the primaries, he showed that a black candidate could rally nationwide support and possibly take the White House.</p></div><div><p>At the same time, by running on a liberal platform, he brought many of the issues important to the party's left wing to the fore and gave them traction, such as universal healthcare and paying reparations to the descendants of slaves.</p></div><div><p>Jackson was on record as a supporter of a Palestinian state, and had called Israel's prime minister "a terrorist".</p></div><div><p>He had also pledged never to use nuclear weapons first and to slash defence spending if he became president - positions that seemed impossible at the height of the Cold War.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6cf3/live/e232b0c0-84b3-11ef-9fd2-1ff0272e012f.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Jesse Jackson is photographed smiling at an unseen person"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jackson took an early lead in the Democratic primaries in 1988, but eventually lost to Michael Dukakis</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>He tried for the White House again four years later and continued to campaign on a liberal agenda of higher taxes, increased public spending and universal, state-funded healthcare.</p></div><div><p>Once more, he made an impressive showing - taking an early lead over Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee - but once more, he lost, this time after winning just under 7 million votes and 1,023 delegates to the Democratic National Convention.</p></div><div><p>Those delegates went on to back reforms to the party's primary process that made it easier for insurgent candidacies like Jackson to compete for the party's presidential nomination without backing from the Democratic establishment.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ba16/live/acf48a30-33b1-11ef-a044-9d4367d5b599.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Bill and Hillary Clinton with Jesse Jackson"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jackson remained a significant power in the Democratic Party</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p></p><h2>Controversial figure</h2><p></p></div><div><p>In 1991, Jackson tried to repeat his Syrian triumph, and visited Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War to plead with Saddam Hussein to release Western hostages.</p></div><div><p>A year later, he decided against a third presidential run and, despite his suspicion of Bill Clinton's centrist "Third Way" policies, lent his support to the former Arkansas governor.</p></div><div><p>When Clinton found his presidency in peril after the public learned about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, he asked Jackson to counsel his family through the crisis.</p></div><div><p>Jackson said that, although Clinton had lied about the relationship, he did not deserve to be impeached for "high crimes". Clinton had committed a "little crime", he said.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a20a/live/2915b780-84b9-11ef-9fd2-1ff0272e012f.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Jesse Jackson with President Bill Clinton in 2000"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jackson after receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Clinton in 2000</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>In 2001, Jackson was publicly called to account for his own affair, when it was revealed he had had a relationship with a member of his staff and fathered a child.</p></div><div><p>Jackson promised to take leave to "revive my spirit and reconnect with my family", but the speed with which he returned to public life damaged his credibility with some clergy across America.</p></div><div><p>In March 2007, Jackson pledged his support for Barack Obama's campaign to become the first African American in the White House.</p></div><div><p>Relations between the two men were initially strained, after Jackson criticised Obama for "talking down to black people".</p></div><div><p>His remarks were picked up by a nearby microphone and Jackson later apologised for his "crude and hurtful remarks".</p></div><div><p>But, in the moments before Obama was due to make his victory speech in Chicago the following November, a television camera picked out Jackson in the audience with tears streaming down his cheeks.</p></div><div><p>Many of those watching suggested that Jackson's success in boosting black turnout in previous presidential campaigns had helped ensure Obama's victory.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef4c/live/a2f58720-84bd-11ef-9fd2-1ff0272e012f.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Jesse Jackson weeping at the election of Barack Obama"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jesse Jackson wept to see Barack Obama become the first African-American president in 2008</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>He later backed the new president's decision to support gay marriage, comparing the situation to the earlier struggle against laws in the country that had barred interracial marriage.</p></div><div><p>While he continued to be a political force, he faced strain at home.</p></div><div><p>In 2013, his oldest son - Jesse Jackson Jr - was convicted of using campaign money to fund his personal lifestyle and sentenced to 30 months in prison.</p></div><div><p>Five years later, Jackson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and had to step down as leader of Rainbow/PUSH, the merged organisation of his two earlier groups.</p></div><div><p>Still, after George Floyd, an African-American man, was killed by police officers in 2020, Jackson travelled to Minneapolis to plead for criminal charges against the officers.</p></div><div><p>And he was a loud voice in favour of withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan, and for increasing the minimum wage.</p></div><div><p>In 2024, Jackson applied for a presidential pardon for his son's conviction, but was refused by then-President Joe Biden.</p></div><div><p>That year, the veteran campaigner also returned to the political realm he loved, making a rare appearance at the Democratic convention in Chicago, where the party officially nominated Kamala Harris for president.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9c27/live/ed7c1460-c0b9-11f0-8a6c-bdcd4bb2f081.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images Jesse Jackson at the 2024 Democratic party convention in Chicago"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Jesse Jackson at the 2024 Democratic convention in Chicago</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>High-profile delegates paid tribute to a man they said had done much to ensure a black woman had a significant chance of reaching the White House.

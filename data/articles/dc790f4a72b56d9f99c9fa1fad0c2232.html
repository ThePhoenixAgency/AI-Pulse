A military confrontation, however costly, may be seen as survivable. Total strategic rollback may not.</p></div><div><p>Yet the risks embedded in this calculation are profound, and not only for Iran.</p></div><div><p>Any US campaign could target senior leadership in its opening phase. If Khamenei is killed, it would not only end a more-than three-decade rule but could destabilise succession at a moment of vulnerability.</p></div><div><p>Strikes on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other security institutions could also weaken the apparatus that recently reasserted control after one of the deadliest and violent crackdowns in the Islamic Republic's history. </p></div><div><p>Protesters who filled the streets in recent weeks - and withdrew only under overwhelming force - remain deeply disaffected. A sudden blow to the state's coercive machinery could shift the domestic balance in unpredictable ways.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3e5b/live/09cdcfd0-fc58-11f0-b7e1-afb6d0884c18.jpg.webp" alt="Reuters Protesters gather as vehicles burn, amid evolving anti-government unrest, in Tehran in this screen grab obtained from a social media video released on 9 January 2026 "><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Human rights groups say during anti-government unrest at the end of 2025 and start of 2026, thousands of people were killed in security crackdowns</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Tehran may assume that Washington's objectives would be limited to degrading nuclear and missile capabilities. But wars rarely unfold according to initial assumptions. Miscalculation over targets, duration or political fallout could quickly expand the conflict.</p></div><div><p>Economic pressures add another layer of risk. Iran's economy, already strained by sanctions, inflation and declining purchasing power, would struggle to absorb further shocks. Disruption to oil exports or damage to infrastructure would compound public anger that has been suppressed rather than resolved.</p></div><div><p>In this context, defiance serves multiple purposes. It signals resolve externally and projects strength internally. But it also narrows space for compromise.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afd2/live/fef4f2e0-0dba-11f1-b5e2-dd58fc65f0f6.jpg.webp" alt="Reuters A black area with rubble strewn is next to buildings in the dusty area of Natanz.

But wars are not fought on paper. They are shaped by miscalculation, escalation and unintended consequences.</p></div><div><p>The recent 12-day war with Israel exposed vulnerabilities in Iran's command structure and military infrastructure. It also offered lessons in adaptation, how to absorb strikes, recalibrate and respond under pressure.</p></div><div><p>A broader confrontation could produce outcomes neither side intends. A weakened central authority in Tehran would not automatically translate into stability or alignment with Western interests. Power vacuums can generate new, fragmented or radicalised centres of influence, complicating the regional balance in ways that are undesirable for Washington and its allies.</p></div><div><p>Ayatollah Khamenei now faces few favourable options. Accepting Washington's conditions risks hollowing out the regime's deterrent strategy. Rejecting them increases the likelihood of confrontation at a time of internal fragility.</p></div><div><p>Between what he may see as the "worst" option; strategic surrender, and the "best of the worst", a limited but containable war, Tehran appears, at least publicly, to be leaning toward the latter.</p></div></article></div></div>

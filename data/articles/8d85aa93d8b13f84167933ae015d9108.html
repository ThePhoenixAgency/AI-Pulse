    <div><div> <p>A <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/paris/" target="_self">Paris</a> court on Monday found ten people guilty of cyberbullying France’s First Lady <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/brigitte-macron/" target="_self">Brigitte Macron</a> by spreading false online claims about her <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/gender-identity/" target="_self">gender</a> and sexuality, including <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251027-how-did-online-rumours-that-brigitte-macron-was-born-male-go-viral" target="_self">allegations she was born a man.</a></p> <p>The court convicted all defendants to sentences ranging from a cyberbullying awareness training to 8-month suspended prison sentences.</p> <p>The court pointed to “particularly degrading, insulting, and malicious” comments referring to false claims regarding alleged trans identity and alleged pedocriminality targeting Brigitte Macron.</p> <p>The defendants, eight men and two women aged 41 to 65, are accused of having posted “numerous malicious comments” falsely claiming that President <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/emmanuel-macron/" target="_self">Emmanuel Macron</a>’s wife was born a man and linking their 24-year age gap to <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/paedophilia/" target="_self">paedophilia</a>. Some of the posts were viewed tens of thousands of times.</p> <p>Brigitte Macron did not attend the two-day trial in October. Speaking on TF1 national television Sunday, she said she launched legal proceedings to “set an example” in the fight against harassment.</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251027-how-did-online-rumours-that-brigitte-macron-was-born-male-go-viral" target="_self">How did online rumours that Brigitte Macron was born male go viral?</a></p> <p>Her daughter, Tiphaine Auzière, testified about what she described as the “deterioration” of her mother’s life since the online harassment intensified. “She cannot ignore the horrible things said about her,” Auzière told the court. She said the impact has extended to the entire family, including Macron’s grandchildren.</p> <p>Defendant Delphine Jegousse, 51, who is known as Amandine Roy and describes herself as a medium and an author, is considered to have played a major role in spreading the rumour after she released a four-hour video on her YouTube channel in 2021. She was given a 6-month prison sentence.</p> <p>The X account of Aurélien Poirson-Atlan, 41, known as Zoé Sagan on social media, was suspended in 2024 after his name was cited in several judicial investigations. Poirson-Atlan was given an 8-month prison sentence.</p> <p>Other defendants include an elected official, a teacher and a computer scientist. Several told the court their comments were intended as humor or satire and said they did not understand why they were being prosecuted.&nbsp;</p> <p>The case follows years of conspiracy theories falsely alleging that Brigitte Macron was born under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux, which is actually the name of her brother. The Macrons have also filed a defamation suit in the United States against conservative influencer Candace Owens.</p> </div></div>

They create fake job ads on LinkedIn and other platforms and offer enticing jobs to software developers working primarily in the Web3 (blockchain) industry.</p><h2>Codename Graphalgo</h2><p>During the “hiring process”, they ask the candidates to go through a few test assignments which always end up with the victims downloading and running malicious code. That code can be different, but the goal is always to empty their <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-bitcoin-wallets" target="_blank">crypto wallets</a> - be it standalone apps, browser add-ons, or accounts on popular crypto exchanges.</p><p>"It is easy to create such job task repositories. Threat actors simply need to take a legitimate bare-bone project and fix it up with a malicious dependency and it is ready to be served to targets," the researchers said. Most of these projects are hosted on legitimate platforms such as PyPI or npm, making it more difficult for the victims to spot the attack.</p><p>So far, ReversingLabs found almost 200 malicious packages.</p><p>The refresh was dubbed Graphalgo because all of the malicious packages had the prefix “graph” in their name and often spoof regular libraries such as graphlib. In more recent times, “graph” was replaced with “big”, but the researchers are yet to find the recruiting part that goes with these packages.</p>

<p>Airbnb says its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/airbnb-is-quietly-rolling-out-an-ai-customer-service-bot-in-the-us/" target="_blank">custom-built AI agent</a> is now handling roughly a third of its customer support issues in North America, and it’s preparing to roll out the feature globally. If successful, the company believes that in a year’s time, more than 30% of its total customer support tickets will be handled by AI voice and chat in all the languages where it also employs a human customer service agent.</p>

<p>“We think this is going to be massive because not only does this reduce the cost base of Airbnb customer service, but the quality of service is going to be a huge step change,” CEO Brian Chesky said during the company’s <a href="https://investors.airbnb.com/press-releases/news-details/2026/Airbnb-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank">fourth-quarter earnings</a> call this week. This seems to suggest he believes the AI would do a better job than its human counterparts in resolving some issues.</p>







<p>The company also touted its recent hire of CTO Ahmad Al-Dahle, <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/02/12/airbnb-abnb-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank">poached from Meta</a> for his AI expertise, and its plans to create an AI-native experience.</p>

<p>With his guidance, Chesky said that Airbnb was poised to introduce an app that doesn’t just search for you, but one that “knows you.” </p>

<p>“It will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,” Chesky explained, adding that’s why Airbnb brought Al-Dahle on board. </p>

<p>“Ahmad is one of the world’s leading AI experts. He spent 16 years at Apple, and most recently led the generative AI team at Meta that built the Llama models. He’s an expert at pairing massive technical scale with world-class design, which is exactly how we’re going to transform the Airbnb experience,” Chesky noted.</p>

<p>Like other businesses poised for disruption by AI, Airbnb’s leadership is pushing the idea that it has a unique database and product that other AI chatbots can’t replicate. </p>

<p>“A chatbot doesn’t have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can’t message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do,” Chesky told analysts during the earnings call. Instead, he pitched the idea of layering AI over the Airbnb experience, which he claimed would help to accelerate growth. </p>

<p>The company forecast revenue growth would be in the “low double digits” this year, after pulling in $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/q4-airbnb-abnb-earnings-2025.html" target="_blank">above estimates </a>of $2.72 billion. This quarter, it expects revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion, above Wall Street forecasts of $2.53 billion.</p>

<p>Investors still wanted to know if AI platforms could be a risk in the long-term, assuming they moved into the short-term rentals market. Chesky, however, pushed back at that idea, saying that Airbnb isn’t just the consumer-facing app; it’s also the host app, the customer service, and the protections it offers, like insurance and user verifications.  </p>







<p>“We’ve built this over 18 years. We handle more than $100 billion in payments through the platform,” he said. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, AI chatbots serve a function similar to search, in that they deliver top-of-funnel traffic, he noted. That traffic also converts at a higher rate than traffic from Google, Chesky pointed out, suggesting that the shift to AI would benefit Airbnb.</p>

<p>The company is already using AI to power its search, with the feature now enabled for a “very small percentage” of Airbnb’s traffic, while it experiments with making its search more conversational. Later, the company plans to integrate sponsored listings within search.   </p>

<p>While Spotify this week told investors its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/spotify-says-its-best-developers-havent-written-a-line-of-code-since-december-thanks-to-ai/" target="_blank">best developers hadn’t written a single line of code</a> since December, thanks to AI, Airbnb offered a more high-level metric on its own internal AI adoption. The company said that 80% of its engineers now use AI tools, and it’s working to get that to 100% soon.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/EGeEJZAFMuH0j2ywenSgydx6r-w=/400x0/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Feature.jpg?lossy" alt="iOS 26 Feature"><br>These adoption numbers are based on iPhones and iPads that transacted on the App Store on February 12, 2026, according to Apple.</p>
<p>The statistics are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>74% of all iPhones introduced in the last four years are running iOS 26.</li>
<li>66% of all iPhones are running iOS 26.</li>
<li>66% of all iPads introduced in the last four years are running iPadOS 26.</li>
<li>57% of all iPads are running iPadOS 26.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how that compares to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/ios-18-adoption-rate/">iOS 18 adoption figures</a> that Apple shared based on iPhones and iPads that transacted on the App Store on January 21, 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>76% of all iPhones introduced in the last four years were running iOS 18.</li>
<li>68% of all iPhones were running iOS 18.</li>
<li>63% of all iPads introduced in the last four years were running iPadOS 18.</li>
<li>53% of all iPads were running iPadOS 18.</li>
</ul>
<p>At first glance, the iOS 26 and iOS 18 adoption figures appear to be similar, but this is only because Apple released the iOS 26 statistics later than usual. iOS 26's statistics are based on devices that transacted with the App Store approximately 150 days after the update was released to the public, compared to 127 days for iOS 18. In other words, iOS 26 was available for around three weeks longer by comparison.</p>
<p>As was suspected, this means that iOS 26 adoption has officially been slower than iOS 18 adoption, but not to the extent that some earlier, unofficial estimates had claimed. There is no way of knowing exactly why iOS 26 adoption has been slower, but some users have opted to avoid the new Liquid Glass design for now.</p>
<p>iPadOS 26 adoption figures are technically higher than iPadOS 18, but again, note that iPadOS 26 benefitted from three extra weeks of availability.</p>

    <div><div><article><p><time>Friday February 20, 2026 7:36 am PST</time> by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/">Joe Rossignol</a></p><div><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/apple-releases-macos-tahoe-26-3/">macOS 26.3</a> hints at Apple's rumored lower-cost MacBook, and two new Studio Display models, according to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3066403/macos-26-3-might-have-just-confirmed-apples-biggest-march-4-surprises.html"><em>Macworld</em>'s Filipe Espósito</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/iJymttjAY98qA-m8IF0n9kcZIus=/400x0/article-new/2025/12/Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature-Pink.jpg?lossy" alt="Low Cost A18 Pro MacBook Feature Pink"><br>Espósito found the following codenames within macOS 26.3's source code, and he revealed the upcoming products that they likely correspond with, based on previous reporting from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and others.</p>
<p>The codenames:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>J700:</strong> Lower-cost MacBook</li>
<li><strong>J427:</strong> A new Studio Display</li>
<li><strong>J527:</strong> A new, higher-end Studio Display</li>
</ul>
<p>This is far from the first time that these codenames have been spotted in Apple's software updates. According to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris, the codenames were also present in updates such as macOS 26.2 and iOS 18.5 last year.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/apple-event-invite-hint-new-macbook-colors/">more</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/new-studio-display-or-pro-display-xdr-filing/">more hints</a> stack up, it is clear that all three products are inching closer to release.</p>
<p>The prevailing assumption is that Apple will unveil the lower-cost MacBook as part of three days of new product announcements <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-announcements-first-week-of-march/">in the first week of March</a>. The media would then receive hands-on time with the laptop <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/apple-announces-special-event-in-new-york/">during the "Apple Experience"</a> in New York, London, and Shanghai on Wednesday, March 4 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time.</p>
<p>The new Studio Displays are expected to be released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-studio-display-2-rumored-features/">in the first half of 2026</a>, but it is unclear if they will be part of the announcements in the first week of March.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/BzUbW1jxxwk5WU441GTcNUByOsU=/400x0/article-new/2022/03/mac-studio-and-studio-display.jpeg?lossy" alt="mac studio and studio display"><br>The lower-cost MacBook is rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-to-launch-low-cost-macbook/">powered by a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip</a>, rather than an M-series chip. The laptop will apparently be available in a variety of bright colors, such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/">yellow, green, blue, and/or pink</a>. Other rumored specs include a 12.9-inch display and 8GB of RAM. The starting price remains to be seen, with estimates ranging from $599 to $799 in the United States.</p>
<p>The lower-cost MacBook would be an all-new model positioned below the MacBook Air, and it would mark a revival of the "MacBook" brand (with no "Air" or "Pro" designation). Apple sold an Intel-based 12-inch "MacBook" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/09/apple-discontinues-12-inch-macbook/">from 2015 to 2019</a>.</p>
<p>At least one of the new Studio Display models is rumored to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/">27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-studio-display-2-unusual-feature-rumor/">up to a 90Hz</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/">120Hz refresh rate</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/">HDR support</a>, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/">A19 chip</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/">A19 Pro chip</a>. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/apple-studio-display-2-latest-rumors/">No major design changes</a> are expected.</p>
<p>If the next Studio Display receives mini-LED backlighting and HDR support, its maximum brightness and contrast ratio would be higher than the current model. And a newer A19 or A19 Pro chip — up from the A13 Bionic currently — should contribute to performance improvements, camera-related enhancements, and more.</p>
<p>There are no details about the second Studio Display. Presumably, it would be a higher-end model, and we can only dream of a larger 32-inch screen size.</p>
<p>The current Studio Display launched in March 2022, alongside the first Mac Studio. It has a 27-inch screen without mini-LED backlighting, a 5K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, up to 600 nits brightness, a built-in camera and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., pricing starts at $1,599.</p>

There are several new references to CarPlay video streaming functionality within the iOS 26.4 beta's source code.

The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max.

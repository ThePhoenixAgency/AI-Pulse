                    <p>Leaker Jon Prosser is back saying he is absolutely certain about all the same previous reports about the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-17e">iPhone 17e</a>, except perhaps that it will use a binned A19 processor.
</p><p>Jon Prosser is currently <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/10/24/jon-prossers-co-defendant-could-settle-leak-lawsuit-with-apple">being sued</a> by Apple over his leaks, but continues to publish videos with claims of what is coming next for the iPhone. Most recently, he <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/19/dynamic-island-will-move-get-really-tiny-if-a-leaker-whos-being-sued-by-apple-is-right">claimed that</a> the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-18">iPhone 18 Pro</a> will move the front-facing camera to the left —  although sources say he <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/20/no-top-left-camera-for-iphone-18-pro-but-a-smaller-dynamic-island">misread a translation</a> and this isn't happening.
</p><p>Now he's published a report and commentary on the expected iPhone 17e. He claims that the model will:
</p><ul><li>Have a Dynamic Island</li>
<li>Cost from $599</li>
<li>Start at 256GB</li>
<li>Have a 6.1-inch screen at 60Hz with no ProMotion</li>
<li>Single 48mp rear camera</li>
<li>Certainly come in black or white</li>
<li>May have a third color option, possibly lavender</li>
<li>Have 8GB RAM</li>
<li>Use a binned A19 processor</li>
<li>Add MagSafe charging</li></ul><p>With the possible exception of the binned A19 processor and the lavender color, all of this has <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/05/fresh-iphone-17e-ipad-leak-points-to-incremental-upgrades">been rumored before</a>. Most of it means the iPhone 17e being a minor update to the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-16e">iPhone 16e</a>, which is also already expected.
</p><p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/15/unsurprisingly-iphone-17e-will-get-dynamic-island-keep-60hz-screen">Previous reports</a> have claimed that the iPhone 17e will use an A19 processor. This is the same one that was used in the 2025 <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-17">iPhone 17</a>, and it did mean that this model performed better than the iPhone 16e.
</p><p>A <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/02/20/core-design-how-chip-binning-helps-apple-offer-a18-variants">binned processor</a> is one where through manufacturing there has been an issue that means it doesn't perform as well as intended. It will still work, but perform a little more poorly.
</p><p>Prosser doesn't mention the issue of the front-facing camera moving or not moving, but he does say that he's "not 100% confident" about the Dynamic Island. If Apple sticks with the older notch, though, he says the company should be embarrassed.
</p><p>The iPhone 17e is currently expected to be launched in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/08/iphone-17e-is-coming-soon-with-a19-and-a-599-price-tag">mid-February 2026</a>.

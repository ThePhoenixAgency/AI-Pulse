    <div><div>  <article>    <div><p>  Faizan Farooque </p> <p><time>Mon, February 16, 2026 at 11:07 AM EST</time> <span>4 min read</span></p></div> <div>    <div>   <p><strong><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/quote/PLTR" target="_blank">Palantir</a> Technologies (<a href="https://www.thestreet.com/quote/PLTR" target="_blank">PLTR</a>) </strong>is one of the biggest artificial intelligence winners this year. The kind of momentum we've see this year is enough to turn anyone into a staunch believer.</p>   <p>That is, until <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/tag/michael-burry" target="_blank">Michael Burry</a> walked into the room like a typical old-school gunslinger and started flipping tables.</p>   <p>Michael Burry's piece, "Palantir's New Clothes: Foundry, AIP &amp; the Failure of Reason," <a href="https://michaeljburry.substack.com/" target="_blank">on his substack</a> is transforming the PLTR thesis and forcing <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/w/wall-street" target="_blank">Wall Street</a> to pay attention. He goes into great detail about why he feels a certain way about the data analytics company.</p>      <p>The broader theme reflects how Palantir’s valuation is drifting far beyond what the underlying business <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/fundamentals" target="_blank">fundamentals</a> can justify. And Burry prefaces his opinions by saying, "So, what I am about to go on and on about is not meant to be personal."</p>   <p>This matters, because it means his critique isn’t framed as a cheap shot at Palantir’s leadership style. Unfortunately, this is what often happens when Palantir is criticized.</p>   <p>Burry's take serves as a caution to investors, who could be using the firm's <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/tag/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">AI</a> story as a way to avoid valuing Palantir.</p>   <figure><div> <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/70wjCbQ6MW.krNUbgWqJ1g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thestreet_881/794bd13a042d8c4721ee272274bbf8d3" alt="A notorious market skeptic says Palantir’s story won’t hold up.Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI on Getty Images" /></p></div> <figcaption>A notorious market skeptic says Palantir’s story won’t hold up.Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI on Getty Images  <span>·</span> <span>Photo by FABRICE COFFRINI on Getty Images</span></figcaption> </figure>      <p>Burry’s headline number is what traders are interested in: <strong>$46 a share</strong>.</p>   <p>He threw out the number as a rough “worth” estimate for Palantir. The figure is based on an analysis of the company’s fundamentals, which are dramatically below where they were after its monster run in 2024 and 2025.</p>   <p><strong>More Palantir </strong></p>   <ul><li> <p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-ceo-delivers-curt-8-180700125.html"><strong>Palantir CEO delivers curt 8-word message to investors</strong></a></p> </li><li> <p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantir-immigration-enforcement-bombshell-hits-190300168.html"><strong>Palantir drops  immigration enforcement bombshell</strong></a></p> </li><li> <p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/popular-analyst-reveals-9-buy-214214150.html"><strong>Popular analyst reveals 9 ‘buy the dip’ tech stocks</strong></a></p> </li> </ul>   <p>However, it is important to note that he did not provide just one number. Instead, Burry laid out a range of scenarios, <a href="https://michaeljburry.substack.com/" target="_blank">from <strong>$21 to $146</strong></a>. He made it clear that he wasn't presenting conventional Wall Street price targets.</p>      <p>Burry also said that he isn’t currently shorting Palantir outright. But he does have <strong><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/p/put-option" target="_blank">put options</a></strong> connected to the stock. It is a subtle distinction, but still a bearish posture.</p>      <p>Burry is a genius when it comes to numbers. But this is not a sterile spreadsheet takedown. Instead, Burry focused considerable time on understanding Palantir’s culture and leadership aura.</p>   <p>What it means is that the stock is not trading on fundamentals; instead, it is focusing on the leadership aura. However, he believes that under pressure, the valuation will fold.</p>    <p>He cited Michael Steinberger’s book The Philosopher in the Valley and highlighted a line attributed to CEO <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/personalities/alex-karp-net-worth" target="_blank">Alex Karp</a> that captures the company’s internal tension.</p>  </div></div> <span> </span>  </article>      <section><header> </header>  <div><ul> <p>Weʼre unable to load stories right now.</p>  </ul></div> </section></div></div>

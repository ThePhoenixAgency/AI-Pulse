I had to deal with doubt and cynicism and fears about a Black person running. There were Black scholars writing papers about why I was wasting my time. Even Blacks said a Black couldn’t win.”</p><p>“It was a big moment in history,” Jackson told the Guardian, 12 years later.</p><p>Twenty years later, the first Black president, Barack Obama, saluted Jackson for making his victory possible.

Jackson<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udlgFnM7JH4&amp;t=35s"> travelled</a> with his classmates to Selma, Alabama to join the movement after he watched news footage of “Bloody Sunday, where King led nonviolent civil rights marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, who were then beaten by law enforcement. Impressed by Jackson’s leadership at Selma, King offered him a position with the civil rights group that he co-founded, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).</p><p>After a couple of years, Jackson put his seminary studies on hold to focus on SCLC’s <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/operation-breadbasket">Operation Breadbasket</a>, an economic justice program that harnessed the power of Black churches by calling on ministers to put pressure companies to employ more Black people through negotiations and boycotts. In 1967, Jackson became Operation Breadbasket’s national director, and was ordained as a minister a year later.</p><p>“We knew he was going to do a good job,” King <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/jackson-jesse-louis">said</a> at an Operation Breadbasket meeting in 1968, “but he’s done better than a good job”.</p><p>Tragedy struck soon after Jackson gained a leadership position at SCLC. On 4 April, 1968, Jackson witnessed King’s assassination from below the balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee.</p><figure><div><img alt="Dr Martin Luther King, Jr (R) and Rev.

He was preceded in death by his mother, Helen Burns Jackson; father, Noah Louis Robinson; and stepfather, Charles Henry Jackson.</em></p> <p>“<em>Our father was a servant leader – not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world. We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honour his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.</em>”</p> <p><em>Public observances will be held in Chicago. Final arrangements for Reverend Jackson’s celebration of life services, including all public events, will be released by the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.</em></p>

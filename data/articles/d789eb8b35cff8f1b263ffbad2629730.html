    <div><div> <p>We’re a month and a half into 2026 and I’m sure I’m not the only one to have already moved on from at least one of my New Year’s resolutions already. But when it comes to my fitness I’ve actually kept on top of my workout regime, and I think my Shokz earphones have played a massive part in keeping me motivated through my fitness journey — and the pressure of my looming July wedding.</p><p>Shokz are best known for their bone-conduction headphones which sit just in front of your ears and send audio vibrations through your skull instead of through the air in your ears. This keeps your ears completely clear — so you can stay fully aware of what’s going on around you — which is why some marathon organizers now allow Shokz headphones while still banning all other headphones.</p><p>I love these designs, but audio quality can take a hit with bone conduction. Things sound better again when your ears are plugged (either with water or an earplug) but that cuts out the advantage of being able to stay more aware of your surroundings.</p><p>That’s why I instead prefer Shokz’ OpenFit and OpenDots designs.</p><p>These earbuds sit over (but don’t fully cover or go inside) your ear canal. The resulting audio performance is louder and fuller than bone conduction headphones of a similar price, but you still have no noise cancellation of the outside world — helping you stay aware of what’s going on.</p><p>I love using my OpenDots One, and my fiancée loves using her OpenFit Air, while at the gym or on a run. We can enjoy great sounding music and podcasts while still staying aware of others on the road or at the gym — or simply just keep chatting while our tunes play as our private background noise.</p><p>It’s also handy while we’re around the home. With noise cancelling headphones you can very easily tune out all noise including your partner, but with open earbuds we don’t have the frustration of wishing the other one could hear us when we need a hand with something.</p><hr><p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

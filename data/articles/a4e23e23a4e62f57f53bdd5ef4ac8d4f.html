    <div><div><p>Bitcoin investors are being forced to rethink why they hold the asset as inflation data cools, according to Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano.</p><p>“I think the challenge for Bitcoin investors, can you hold an asset when there is not high inflation in your face on a day-to-day basis?” Pompliano <a href="https://x.com/APompliano/status/2021944958178275347?s=20" target="_blank">said</a> during an interview with Fox Business on Thursday. “Can you still believe in what Bitcoin’s value proposition is, which is that it’s a finite-supply asset. If they print money, Bitcoin is going higher,” he said.</p><p>“Bitcoin and gold are great long-term things,” he said. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI), a widely used measure of inflation, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">fell</a> to 2.4% in January from 2.7% in December, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, Mark Zandi, Moody’s chief economist, recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/heres-the-inflation-breakdown-for-january-2026-in-one-chart.html#:~:text=The%20consumer%20price%20index%2C%20an,shutdown%20in%20October%2C%20economists%20said." target="_blank">told</a> CNBC that inflation “looks better on paper than in reality.”</p><figure>    <img alt="Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Price" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c5a1f-d716-7e50-a993-33d85efce981.png" /><figcaption><em>Anthony Pompliano spoke to Charles Payne on Fox Business on Thursday.

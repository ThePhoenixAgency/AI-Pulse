    <div><div><p>Nexo is set to relaunch its digital asset services and crypto exchange platform in the US on Monday, more than three years after it left the market following battles with federal and state regulators.</p><p>Now, citing improved regulatory clarity for digital assets in the US, the rebooted Nexo platform will offer flexible and fixed-term yield programs, a spot cryptocurrency exchange, crypto-backed credit lines and a loyalty program for US users, Nexo head of communications Eleonor Genova told Cointelegraph.</p><p>The platform’s trading infrastructure will be provided by Bakkt, a US-based digital asset platform focused on serving institutional clients. Genova said:</p><blockquote>“Nexo’s US offering is structured through partnerships with appropriately licensed US service providers. Certain services are made available via a third-party Securities and Exchange Commission-registered (SEC) investment adviser, which provides advisory services under applicable US securities laws.” </blockquote><figure>    <img alt="SEC, United States, Nexo" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6236-9830-7aa0-87d3-a9e7744ba18d.png" /><figcaption><em>Current SEC Chair Paul Atkins testifies to Congress.

With MagSafe, you’re less likely to wake up to find your phone wasn’t correctly placed on the wireless charger so didn’t charge at all!</p> <h2>Testing the best for you</h2> <p>We have tested a lot of magnetic chargers—MagSafe, Qi2 and Compatible—and here inform you which one will work best for you. There are simple magnetic wireless chargers, multi-device chargers for iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods, travel chargers, car chargers and more. </p> <ul>

</ul> <p>Offering up to 25W power output in the right configuration, MagSafe charging is much faster than basic 7.5W magnetic wireless charging. The similar magentic <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2128673/what-is-qi2-is-qi2-iphone-wireless-charging-better-than-magsafe.html">Qi2 standard</a>, supported by the iPhone 13-17 families (and unofficially the iPhone 12 but strangely not the latest 16e) offers similar 15W speed charging. <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2128673/what-is-qi2-is-qi2-iphone-wireless-charging-better-than-magsafe.html">Qi 2.2</a>, also known as Qi2 25W, meets MagSafe at 25W for iPhone 16/17 series.</p> <h2>MagSafe or Qi2 certification</h2> <p>Apple certifies <strong>MagSafe</strong> accessories to ensures that the output charging is 15W for most iPhones, and up to 25W for iPhone 16 and 17 (with Apple’s latest MagSafe charger or chargers certified for Qi2 25W). Non-certified magnetic but “MagSafe-compatible” chargers are usually just 7.5W with a ring of magnets to hold your phone in place. Certified MagSafe chargers also have a single-wire NFC antenna that allows the iPhone to identify the device and a built-in magnetometer to prevent compass interference while you are using your iPhone while it’s charging.</p> <p>In our tests, 15W MagSafe and <strong>Qi2</strong> chargers are evenly matched for charging speeds. 7.5W MagSafe compatible chargers, as you might expect, take around twice as long—certainly in the early stages of charging. But don’t rule out 7.5W chargers as they are often high quality, nearly always noticeably cheaper and just take a while longer to fully charge an iPhone. The king of the hill is Apple’s new MagSafe charger and chargers based on the new <strong>Qi2 25W</strong> technology that are definitely faster at 25W, but only with iPhone 16 or later.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Made-for-MagSafe-and-Qi2-Qi2-25W-logos.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" alt="Made for MagSafe and Qi2 and Qi2 25W logos"></figure><p>Foundry</p></div> <h2>Simple vs multi-device magnetic chargers</h2> <p>The most basic form of MagSafe or magnetic charger is the simple pad that latches on to the compatible iPhone. Some pads feature a pop-out arm so the iPhone can be propped up while charging. There are also products that can simultaneously charge an iPhone plus other Apple devices, such as an Apple Watch or wireless AirPods charging case. Note that the AirPods case must be of the wireless variety, and the original AirPods case lacked this functionality. The base of a multi-charger could also be used to charge a second iPhone but mostly not magnetically and at 5W rather than 7.5W, 15W, or 25W. Also see our round up of the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/668468/best-apple-watch-chargers-stands-docks.html">Best Apple Watch chargers and stands</a>.</p> <p>A simple MagSafe charging pad is the cheapest route to wireless iPhone charging. If you are going to the bother of connecting this product to a wall charger, why not just use a Lightning (iPhone 14 or earlier) or USB-C (iPhone 15 and up) cable direct to the iPhone? You can fast-charge an iPhone to 50% battery in under 30 minutes using a cable and just over that using a 25W charger, while it takes around 50 minutes to wirelessly charge iPhone from 0 to 50% using even 15W MagSafe.</p> <p>That said, there are interesting options to choose from. After these we’ll look at more multi-functional MagSafe chargers.</p> <div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Apple MagSafe Charger – Best simple MagSafe charger for fastest wireless </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Apple MagSafe Charger – Best simple MagSafe charger for fastest wireless" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-MagSafe-Charger-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

</ul>
<p>The most obvious MagSafe Charger to buy for your Apple iPhone is, of course, the <strong>Apple MagSafe Charger</strong>. It’s the charger that Apple would have shipped with the iPhone if it did such things anymore. It’s as minimalist a design as you’d expect from Apple–it looks a lot like a giant Apple Watch Charger. You can also use it to charge your AirPods.</p> <p>Apple’s latest version of this charger offers 15W Qi2 support and, more importantly, a faster 25W charging speed with iPhone 16 and later. It also added a 2-meter length option for $10/£10 more, which is very welcome. At least a 30W USB-C power adapter is required for 25W charging.</p> <p>In our tests using the Apple MagSafe Charger we wirelessly powered up an iPhone 16 Pro from 0% to 50% in just over 30 minutes.</p> <p>It can also charge your AirPods case (AirPods 2 or AirPods Pro), although not at the same time as the iPhone—for that, you’ll need at least a 2-in-1 wireless charger.</p> <p>The standard 1m cable is too short to comfortably charge and use your iPhone at the same time, or maybe stretch from a power socket to a nearby table, so we recommend the 2m upgrade. Don’t forget that this Apple charger still requires a <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234733/best-usb-c-power-adapters-iphone-fast-charging.html">USB-C power adapter</a>—at least 20W if you want 15W charging and at least 30W to enable 25W charging.</p> </div> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Ugreen MagFlow Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad 25W – Alternative simple 25W MagSafe charger </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Ugreen MagFlow Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad 25W – Alternative simple 25W MagSafe charger" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ugreen-MagFlow-Magnetic-Wireless-Charging-Pad-25W.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>The <strong>Ugreen MagFlow Qi2 25W Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad</strong> isn’t too dissimilar to the 25W <strong>Apple MagSafe Charger</strong> except that it’s a fetching shade of what Apple would call Mist or Sky Blue. As such it would perfectly suit the iPhone 17 and iPhone Air of those shades.</p> <p>Another difference is the length of cable and maybe 1.5m is a Goldilocks length for you if Apple’s 1m cable is too short and 2m cable too long.</p> <p>Other than that, this simple charger matches the Apple pad for speed (25W for iPhone 16/17 and 15W for iPhone 12-15), and is more likely to be found discounted than the Apple either direct or on Amazon. It’s a solid alternative to Apple if any of these differences take your fancy.</p> </div> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Anker Zolo Wireless Charger (Magnetic, Pad) – Best budget simple MagSafe charger </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Anker Zolo Wireless Charger (Magnetic, Pad) – Best budget simple MagSafe charger" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anker-15W-Qi2-Charger-Pad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>Another basic magnetic charger, Anker’s <strong>Zolo Magnetic Wireless Charger Pad</strong> works just like the Apple pad, and also at a fast 15W—although it’s technology is Qi2 rather than Apple MagSafe. iPhone 16 and 17 owners should consider spending the extra on the Apple charger (reviewed above) for its special 25W charging speed. Owners of iPhone 15 or earlier can rest assured that this charger is as fast as the Apple one.</p> <p>It works just as well, though, and is one of the cheaper premium magnetic chargers. The cable is a decent length at 1.5m—half again as long as that on the base model Apple MagSafe Charger pad, but not as long as on the top-end 2m Apple charger or the 2m Belkin MagSafe charger reviewed below.</p> <p>Like Apple’s <strong>MagSafe Charger</strong> it can also charge your AirPods case (AirPods 2 or AirPods Pro) when the iPhone is removed.</p> <p>In the U.S. Anker offers this charger only in a <a href="https://anker.pxf.io/c/321564/1543954/18023?subId1=1-1-668980-1-0-0-0-0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fb25m2%3Fvariant%3D44993626570902" target="_blank">two-pack</a>.

<p>The 25W <strong>Belkin UltraCharge Magnetic Charger Pad</strong> is now just as fast as Apple’s charger for the iPhone 16/17 families, and comes with a long cable and handy pop-up stand. The cable is twice as long as Apple’s basic model, which makes using the phone much easier when charging. It’s also thicker nylon-braided cable with a handy integrated silicone cable tie.</p> <p>Belkin sells <a href="https://belkin.evyy.net/c/321564/214281/3736?subId1=1-1-668980-1-0-0-0-0&amp;u=https://www.belkin.com/p/magnetic-charger-with-qi2-25w/WIA014ttWH.html" target="_blank">two versions</a>, one with a squarer back shape and one rounder—the difference is minimal. There’s also an option to buy with a 36W power adapter (for a very reasonable extra $10) included or just on its own if you already have a wall charger to use.</p> <p>Again, a straight cable connection will be faster but we like the kickstand, which you don’t get with a standard cable connection.</p> <p>There are a few very similar Belkin Charger Pads so make sure you get what you’re after. For example, there is a slower but slightly more affordable <strong>15W BoostCharge Pro Magnetic Charging Pad</strong> with stand (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Magnetic-Wireless-Charging-Kickstand/dp/B0F1RQ48GG?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html" target="_blank">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Belkin-Magnetic-Wireless-Charging-Pop-Up-Black/dp/B0F4DY1QXV?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html" target="_blank">Amazon UK</a>) and 7.5W MagSafe-compatible <strong>BoostCharge Charger Pad</strong> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Magnetic-Wireless-Compatible-Extra-Long/dp/B08ZJVL8H5?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html" target="_blank">Amazon U.S.</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Belkin-Wireless-Compatible-Extra-Long-Included-White/dp/B08ZL53JMB?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html" target="_blank">Amazon U.K.</a>) that lacks the stand.

<p>This magnetic charging nightstand uses Qi2 so can charge wirelessly at 15W. Even though it ships with additional U.K. and E.U. plug adapters that clip on the included mini 20W wall charger it’s probably too heavy for travel, but that heft makes it super stable when in landscape StandBy mode.</p> <p>It is less of an easy fit in a portrait (vertical) orientation as the bottom of the iPhone pushes the stand up onto its edge. It’s still stable but looks a little odd from the side. On a nightstand landscape makes more sense anyway. It can be laid flat to wirelessly charge your AirPods case, too, at 7.5W.</p> <p>What really stands out is the gorgeous Dark Cherry color that is available as an Apple Store exclusive.</p> </div> </div> </div> <h2>Best 2-in-1 MagSafe chargers</h2> <p>Why restrict your charger to just one device?

<p>The <strong>Nomad Stand One</strong> uses Qi 2.2 wireless charging technology, so offers the super-fast 25W charging speed.</p> <p>It’s a lovely looking stand that is the sturdiest wireless charging stand we’ve tested, with a real heft and an anti-slip rubber base. It measures 3.2 x 6.3 x 5 inches (8.2 x 16.1 x 12.8cm) and weighs nearly 2lbs (just under 1kg), so could be used as a paperweight if you have your desk fan turned up too high. It’s made of metal with a glass panel that gives it a glossy Apple-like look from the front.</p> <p>The 21-degree viewing angle works well for comfortable viewing but if you want to customize the angle to your own liking you’ll need to choose one of the more adjustable 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 wireless chargers reviewed below.</p> <p>Nomad does make a 3-in-1 version, the $159 <strong><a href="https://howl.link/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Fstand-one-max-4th-gen-carbide&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Farticle%2F668980%2Fbest-magsafe-chargers.html&amp;u1=1-1-668980-1-0-0-0-0" target="_blank">Stand One Max</a></strong>, which can charge iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods at the same time.

<p>One of the new breed of Qi2 25W wireless chargers, the <strong>Belkin 2-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Charger with Qi2 25W</strong> folds up to a very pocketable 4.2 x 2.4 x 0.94 inches (10.6 x 6 x 2.4cm) and weighs 5.1oz (146g). It’s available in two forms: one with rounded edges (pictured) and one that’s straighter. Both are smooth but may be a little too plasticky for some tastes. The blue version is rather natty, though.</p> <p>It passed our 25W charging test by getting an iPhone 16 Pro from 0% to 50% in 33 minutes. There’s a side 5W USB-C port that you can plug an Apple Watch charger into.</p> <p>As a fold-up charger it’s suitably travel friendly. Alternatives include the <strong>Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable</strong> and the <strong>Ugreen MagFlow Foldable 2-in-1</strong>, both reviewed below. The 15W Satechi is slower and larger than the two 25W 2-in-1 chargers but we still like its more solid desktop looks. Choose between the Belkin and Ugreen on form factor and price. Note that the Ugreen doesn’t ship with a USB-C charger, while the Belkin does.</p> </div> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand – Best-looking 2-in-1 magnetic charger </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand – Best-looking 2-in-1 magnetic charger" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Satechi-2-in-1-foldable-Qi2-Charging-Stand.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

It is not portable like the Satechi and Ugreen 2-in-1 chargers, also reviewed above, but it is a good-looking stand for your desk or nightstand. </p> <p>Built to charge both an iPhone 12/13/14/15/16/17 and wireless AirPod case charger, it is reaches the same 15W phone charging heights with its Qi2 technology. The AirPods are charged at 5W, which is standard for all such multi-device magnetic chargers.</p> <p>You get angled landscape (up to 45 degrees) and portrait modes with this good-looking stand from one of our favorite premium accessory makers. The magnetic link is super strong so you don’t need to worry about the iPhone falling off even during re-angling.</p> <p>If you’re not in a hurry, you can still find the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094FMWPPM?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html" target="_blank">Anker 7.5W PowerWave</a> model a little cheaper but we like the faster charge on the 15W version.

<p>Belkin’s expanding range of fast Qi2 wireless chargers includes a simple pad that can fit an iPhone plus an AirPods case. Although it doesn’t include an Apple Watch charging module, there is a 5W USB-C port that you can connect your Watch-charging cable into and charge all three devices simultaneously.</p> <p>As a 2-in-1 solution it is cheaper and better suited for those who haven’t succumbed to the Apple Watch.</p> <p>Being certified as Qi2 means that it can wirelessly charge at the same 15W as official MagSafe chargers but not 25W like the Apple MagSafe Charger or newer Qi2 25W chargers can for the iPhone 16 and later.</p> <p>The pad is reassuringly heavy so you won’t pull it off your bedside table when you remove your iPhone from the magnetic pad. This makes it less obviously portable, but it’s small and flat enough to slip into a backpack.</p> <p>As it’s a pad you can’t angle the phone into StandBy mode. If you want to more easily see the time on your nightstand, consider one of the charging stands reviewed above. It ships with a 30W USB-C wall charger and cable.</p> </div> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> SwanScout 706M Dual Phone Charging Station – Best magnetic charging stand for two iPhones </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="SwanScout 706M Dual Phone Charging Station – Best magnetic charging stand for two iPhones" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SwanScout-Dual-Phone-Charging-Station.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>Unless you own expensive burner iPhones, this charger is made for homes or offices where friends, family and colleagues can charge their iPhones at the same time and in the same place using just one power socket. We didn’t include it in our 3-in-1 roundup (see this immediately below) as it doesn’t charge the Apple Watch, although it can certainly power up three devices at the same time.</p> <p>It’s the only magnetic wireless charging stand we’ve tested that charges two iPhones on a proper stand, and there’s a 3.5W Qi wireless charging pad underneath for one set of AirPods—your pal’s earbuds will have to wait their turn. The charging pads are not adjustable but the angle is perfect for screen viewing. </p> <p>The <strong>SwanScout 706M</strong> is MagSafe Compatible rather than certified MagSafe or Qi2 so its wireless charging speed is limited to 7.5W or 10W shared across the two iPhone pads. That makes it a slow charge but this is fine for a nightstand where you have several hours for charging.</p> </div> </div> </div> <h2>Best 3-in-1 MagSafe chargers</h2> <p>If you have brought full-in on the Apple product ecosystem, and have iPhone, AirPods and an Apple Watch, there are some great 3-in-1 magnetic chargers that will wirelessly charge all three devices simultaneously. 3-in-1 charging stands save you precious desk space or keep your nightstand or bedside table clear of clutter, while ensuring that you don’t run out of power during the day. </p> <div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Belkin UltraCharge Pro 3-in-1 – Fast 25W 3-in-1 magnetic stand </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Belkin UltraCharge Pro 3-in-1 – Fast 25W 3-in-1 magnetic stand" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Belkin-UltraCharge-Pro-3-in-1-Magnetic-Charging-Dock-side-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>The first Qi2 25W charger in the Macworld labs was <strong>Belkin’s UltraCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Dock</strong>. Not only is this a super-speedy 3-in-1 charger, it’s a striking low-profile design with adjustable charging pad angling off a chrome-finished metal frame. The certified Apple Watch charger is fast, too.</p> <p>Qi2 25W (sometimes known as Qi 2.2) takes wireless charging from its 15W maximum to a heady 25W. Previously only possible on the latest version of Apple’s own <strong>MagSafe Charger</strong>, 25W theoretically moves a 50% iPhone refill from 45 to just 25 minutes but environmental conditions such as temperature and the power used by the phone while being charged mean that 30-35 minutes is a more more realistic charging time for 25W. For wireless charging that’s still a big leap forward.</p> <p>As 25W is achievable only with an iPhone 16 or 17 running at least iOS 26 it’s a new frontier for iPhone users. 25W chargers still work with earlier iPhones (12-15) but are pegged back at Qi2’s 15W maximum. All will feel the benefit of Belkin’s built-in active cooling ChillBoost fan.</p> </div> <p> Read our full <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2882564/belkin-ultracharge-pro-3-in-1-magnetic-charging-dock-review-speed-and-style.html"> Belkin UltraCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Dock review </a> </p> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Anker Prime 3-in-1 MagGo Wireless Charging Station – Fastest 25W 3-in-1 magnetic stand </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Anker Prime 3-in-1 MagGo Wireless Charging Station – Fastest 25W 3-in-1 magnetic stand" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Anker-Prime-3-in-1-Wireless-Charging-Station-iPhone-Watch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>This <strong>Anker Prime 3-in-1</strong> iPhone stand takes speedy Qi2 25W charging to a traditionally elegant arm-based charging station design where the iPhone and Watch charging pads are suspended from the circular base. In our tests it came out fastest of all the 25W wireless chargers we have run through their paces—charging an iPhone 16 Pro to 50% in just 28 minutes.</p> <p>The iPhone and Watch charging pads are held high on chrome arms that are angled for viewing angle and overall stand stability. We appreciate that the angle of the iPhone pad can be adjusted to your liking. The AirPods Qi pad is in the base beneath the arms and behind a neat and informative 1.65-inch HD&nbsp;smart display that is the first we’ve seen on such a stand. This is combined with app connectivity, so you can view power flow, charging temperature, and more. This where you can set the charging mode and also customize the clock face.</p> </div> <p> Read our full <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2996349/anker-prime-3-in-1-maggo-25w-wireless-charging-station-review.html"> Anker Prime 3-in-1 MagGo Wireless Charging Station review </a> </p> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Stand – Elegant 15W 3-in-1 magnetic stand </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Stand – Elegant 15W 3-in-1 magnetic stand" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BoostCharge-Pro-3-in-1-Magnetic-Wireless-Charging-Stand-with-Qi2-15W-white.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>More affordable than the Anker 3-in-1 but slower at 15W, Belkin’s wireless charging stand is similarly elegant and with an even more adjustable iPhone pad (90 degrees vs Anker’s 80). The arm placement is different but not functionally, so the design choice at least come down to personal preference.</p> <p>While the iPhone charging is slower (15W vs 25W) the Watch and AirPods will power up in roughly the same time as you get with the Anker 3-in-1. If you are charging your iPhone overnight or have more time on your hand, the speed difference shouldn’t matter. It also lacks the Anker’s smart display if you like to keep up to date with exactly how fast your devices are charging.</p> </div> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> ESR Qi2.2 25W HaloLock 3-in-1 Charger with CryoBoost – Versatile 3-in-1 magnetic stand </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="ESR Qi2.2 25W HaloLock 3-in-1 Charger with CryoBoost – Versatile 3-in-1 magnetic stand" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ESR-25W-Cryoboost-3-in-1-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-side.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>Another Qi2 25W solution, the <strong>ESR 3-in-1 25W Charging Station</strong> offers fast 25W iPhone wireless charging and 5W Apple Watch fast charging in a small-footprint design (3.4-inch square base) that tucks the Apple Watch charger at the back. The Watch charger is detachable, meaning you can remove it and take it with you to plug directly into any USB-C charging port. This is a useful option missing from most other 3-in-1 chargers, although the opportunity to later mislay it must be considered.</p> <p>Where this charger excels is wireless charging speed. As with the <strong>Belkin UltraCharge Pro</strong>, reviewed above, it uses a fan-based cooling technology (ESR’s is called CryoBoost) with advanced heat-dissipation that makes the operation more battery friendly—resulting in significantly faster charging times.</p> <p>The ESR’s Qi 2.2 pad is not adjustable, although you can position the iPhone in either landscape (StandBy) or portrait orientations. In this way it lacks the front-facing flexibility of the <strong>Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe</strong>, reviewed further down, but it is available at a significantly lower price and much faster. It comes with a decent-length cable and a 50W USB-C wall charger.</p> <p>Remember that 25W is only possible for users of the iPhone 16 or 17. Owners of pre-iPhone 16 models can save money by buying the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ESR-Wireless-CryoBoost-Certified-Phone-Cooling/dp/B0D7YXQ77M?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html" target="_blank">Qi2 15W model ESR 3-in-1 Charger with CryoBoost</a></strong> that’s a little taller but otherwise distinguished only by the 15W maximum speed and a 35W charger compared to the 50W wall charger that ships with the 25W model. In our tests this cheaper Qi2-based CryoBoost 3-in-1 Charger took only 10 minutes longer to charge an iPhone 16 Pro to 50% than the 25W charger. If you can handle waiting that long, you can save some serious money, but those seemingly few minutes do add up over the lifetime of the product.</p> </div> <p> Read our full <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2927742/esr-cryoboost-3-in-1-magnetic-25w-charging-station-qi2-2-review.html"> ESR CryoBoost 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station (25W, Qi2.2) review </a> </p> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Satechi 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand – Most flexible 15W 3-in-1 magnetic stand </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Satechi 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand – Most flexible 15W 3-in-1 magnetic stand" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Satechi-3-in-1-foldable-Qi2-Charging-Stand_back-watch-iphone-airpods.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>A 3-in-1 charger that can re-power iPhone, AirPods and Watch is a boon for Apple fans, but most of the products we’ve tested take up quite a lot of desk space. The stylish <strong>HiRise 3 Deluxe</strong>, as its name suggests, goes more vertical and so has a smaller footprint—handy for bedside tables and other places where a giant charging stand is less welcome.</p> <p>It is fully Apple certified, so can fast-charge any MagSafe iPhone (iPhone 12-17 models but not the 16e or SE) at 15W as well as fast-charge any Apple Watch at 5W and Apple AirPods at 7.5W. That said, in tests we did find the HiRise 3 noticeably slower than some chargers when powering up an iPhone. Look to the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2996349/anker-prime-3-in-1-maggo-25w-wireless-charging-station-review.html"><strong>Anker Prime 3-in-1</strong></a> (reviewed above) if you want the fastest iPhone wireless charging in a multi-device format. The base charges at 7.5W and can be used to power up AirPods or a second iPhone, and the Watch part fast charges at 5W.</p> <p>The MagSafe iPhone charger can angle and tilt by 35-degrees, and hold the device in either landscape or portrait—so works well in <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1972460/ios-17-standby-clock-widgets-photos-customize.html">iOS StandBy mode</a>. The Watch charger is also tiltable and we like the way everything but the AirPods case is front-facing.</p> <p>A similarly priced small-footprint alternative is the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2135180/otterbox-3-in-1-charging-station-review-wirelessly-fast-charge-all-your-mobile-devices.html">OtterBox 3-in-1 Wireless Charger</a>.</p> </div> <p> Read our full <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2073921/twelve-south-hirise-3-deluxe-review.html"> Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe review </a> </p> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Anker 3-in-1 Cube with MagSafe – Best compact 3-in-1 magnetic charger </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Anker 3-in-1 Cube with MagSafe – Best compact 3-in-1 magnetic charger" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Anker-3-in-1-Cube-MagSafe-charger.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>The <strong>Anker 3-in-1 Cube</strong> MagSafe charger is certified by Apple, so offers full 15W wireless charging for iPhone 12/13/14/15/16 plus 5W for AirPods and 5W for Apple Watch. Although on the heavy side, it’s super-compact and great for travel. The Watch charging part is hidden in the cube until you need it. It comes with a 30W USB-C wall charger with switchable UK and EU plug fittings that slide onto the US plug prongs.</p> <p>Its tiny footprint means it takes up little space on your desk or bedside cable, too. If you don’t own an Apple Watch, consider the equally dinky <strong>Ugreen 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand</strong>, reviewed in our 2-in-1 roundup above. The stand works in landscape and portrait orientations but isn’t high. It does have adjustable viewing angles up to 60°.</p> <p>A similar 3-in-1 charger from the same company is the A-frame <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2036132/anker-737-maggo-charger-review.html"><strong>Anker 737 MagGo</strong></a>, which can also simultaneously charge an iPhone (at 15W), AirPods and Watch. Aside from the shape, the only real difference from the Anker 3-in-1 Cube with MagSafe is that the slightly cheaper 737 doesn’t support fast-charging for the Apple Watch.</p> </div> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Satechi Qi2 Trio Wireless Charging Pad – 3-in-1 Qi2 charging pad </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Satechi Qi2 Trio Wireless Charging Pad – 3-in-1 Qi2 charging pad" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Satechi-Qi2-Trio-Wireless-Charging-Pad-devices.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>The <strong>Nimble Podium 3-in-1 Wireless Charger</strong>, like the shorter <strong>Satechi Qi2 Trio Wireless Charging Pad</strong> reviewed above, hosts an adjustable iPhone charging pad but its is placed in the center of the three charging points rather than to one side.

<p>The <strong>Zens 4-in-1 Modular Charging Station</strong> for iPhone, AirPods, Apple Watch and iPad is a MagSafe-certified charging stand made from recycled plastic that can handle not just four Apple devices but more if you buy extra charging modules (up to three at one time) to connect. Any MagSafe iPhone (12-17) can be wirelessly charged at up to 15W, faster than non-certified MagSafe-compatible chargers but not at the possible fastest 25W speed. AirPods and Apple Watch will each charge wirelessly at 5W.</p> <p>The iPhone can be placed in either portrait or landscape mode. At the back is a stand where you can place an iPad, which can be wired charged via a side-mounted USB-C port at up to 30W. All devices can be charged simultaneously as the power supply has a 65W total output. The Watch module that ships with the 4-in-1 charger can handily be situated on either the right- or left-hand side depending on your preference. Modules attach magnetically. The Apple Watch extension can be disconnected from the main station and charged via a USB-C port to become a standalone wireless charger when traveling.</p> </div> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> HyperJuice Next Qi2 4-in-1 Magnetic Charging Stand – Charge two iPhones at the same time </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="HyperJuice Next Qi2 4-in-1 Magnetic Charging Stand – Charge two iPhones at the same time" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hyper-Qi2-4-in-1-Magnetic-Charging-Stand_devices.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>This 4-in-1 is the same size as most 3-in-1 charging pads but can wirelessly charge two iPhones at the same time: one via a fast and ultra-adjustable 15W Qi2 charging pad and another via a 10W non-magnetic Qi base that would also work with a second pair of AirPods. The 5W Watch charging pad is certified for fast-charge.</p> <p>The <strong>Hyper Juice Next</strong> is the most portable 4-in-1 MagSafe charger we have tested as the iPhone and Watch stand folds down to a flatter, more travel-friendly shape. The 45W power supply also comes with international plug heads for U.S., U.K., E.U. and A.N.Z. There’s also a further USB-C port for input only, but useful if you’d rather not carry the power supply with you on your journey or just want to plug it into an existing multi-port charger at home.</p> <p>The base is solid but the overall 664g weight might put you off travelling with it in your hand luggage.</p> </div> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Mous 4-in-1 Fast Charging Wireless Station – Charge two iPhones at the same time </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Mous 4-in-1 Fast Charging Wireless Station – Charge two iPhones at the same time" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mous-4-in-1-Wireless-Charging-Station.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>Power specialist Anker was one of the first companies to release Qi2-compatible chargers, and the foldable <strong>Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station</strong> is a great example of what the technology can offer.</p> <p>It charges the iPhone (iPhone 13 and later) at 15W, and is also certified by Apple to fast-charge the Apple Watch, as well as Qi charge AirPods in a wireless charging case–all at the same time.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Anker-Ultra-Compact-3-in-1-Qi2-Charger_folded.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Anker Ultra Compact 3 in 1 Qi2 Charger folded"></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div> <p>It is super compact and folds up into a round pocketable shape that won’t take up much space in a bag or tidied away on your nightstand. It measures 2.36 x 2.36 x 1.4 inches (6 x 6 x 3.6cm) when folded and weighs just 3.8oz (108g). The 5W Watch-charging module folds on the top. The iPhone mostly lays flat, but it can be placed into a more useful StandBy mode as a stand with some folding wizardry.</p> <p>There are other 3-in-1 foldable charger contenders—for example, the faster <strong>25W Kuxiu X40 Turbo</strong>, reviewed below.

<p>With a similar but smaller form the <strong>Twelve South ButterFly</strong> is an easily pocketable 2-in-1 charger that can handle iPhone and Apple Watch or iPhone and AirPods, charging two devices simultaneously.</p> <p>It is fully Apple certified, so wirelessly charges the iPhone at 15W and the Watch at 5W. You can get faster 25W wireless charging, but the Butterfly is such a delightful design that we still love it.</p> <p>It’s a really clever, compact foldable size and offers MacBook-like styling. Unfurl the charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed. You can fold 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nighstand mode. Flip it round, and you can set the iPhone in landscape StandBy mode. If you want to charge an Apple Watch too, you should instead consider the <strong>Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Folding Wireless Charging Station</strong>, reviewed above.</p> <p>Yes, it’s expensive but also in the box is a super-compact 30W USB-C wall charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads: US, UK, EU and AU/NZ.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Twelve-South-ButterFly-SE-Watch-iPhone-Chargers.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Twelve South ButterFly SE Watch iPhone Chargers"></figure><p>Twelve South</p></div> <p>For a greater choice of colors the <strong><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2444819/twelve-south-butterfly-se-2-in-1-qi2-charger-review-minimalist-beauty.html">ButterFly SE</a></strong> version, pictured above, uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe but at the same 15W charging speed.

<p>Although it looks big next to the tiny Mouse 3-in-1 charger (reviewed above) <strong>ESR’s Foldable 3-in-1</strong> is much faster at 25W and actually quite dinky itself at 4.3 x 2.4 x 0.63 inches (11 x 6.2 x 1.6cm).</p> <p>It’s more plasticky than Ugreen’s equally speedy&nbsp;<strong>25W MagFlow 3-in-1</strong>, reviewed above, which might sound unattractive but it means that it’s lighter and therefore much more portable for travel or commuting purposes: 148g compared to 210g for the more metallic Ugreen.</p> <p>ESR is proud of its CryoBoost active-cooling system, and so it should be as the fan is whisper-quiet but keeps the wireless charging as close to maximum 25W as long as possible.</p> </div> <p> Read our full <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3034015/esr-cryoboost-foldable-3-in-1-magnetic-charging-station-25w-review.html"> ESR CryoBoost Foldable 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station (25W) review </a> </p> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (Foldable 3-in-1) – Compact travel MagSafe charger </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (Foldable 3-in-1) – Compact travel MagSafe charger" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Anker-15W-Qi2-3-in-1-MagGo-Charger-charging.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>We love Anker’s more circular folding Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station, reviewed above. The company also makes a squarer 3-in-1 15W Qi2 foldable charger with, as far as I can work out, exactly the same name and much the same charging features.</p> <p>It measures about the length and width of a credit card (3.5×2.36 inches; 8.9×6cm) and an inch (2.5cm) deep, weighing 6.9oz (195g). The 5W Watch-charging module is tucked away on the underside and can lie flat or sit up at an angle for Nightstand mode.</p> <p>The Qi2 pad raises to create a stand for your iPhone, in either portrait or landscape mode for StandBy mode. You can also charge an iPhone with the charger folded and the Qi2 pad on top. You need to unfold it only if you want to charge some AirPods or use the Qi2 pad as a stand.</p> </div> <p> Read our full <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2249964/anker-maggo-3-in-1-wireless-charging-station-review-qi2-apple-charger.html"> Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (Foldable 3-in-1) review </a> </p> </div> <div> <p> </p><h2> ESR Qi2 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set – Flattest 3-in-1 travel magnetic charger </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="ESR Qi2 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set – Flattest 3-in-1 travel magnetic charger" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ESR-Qi2-3-in-1-Wireless-Charging-Set-Brown.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>The <strong>ESR 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set</strong> is certified by Apple for Apple Watch and Qi2 for 15W iPhone charging. ESR sells a faster 25W model (the 25W <strong>CryoBoost Foldable 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Station</strong>, see above) but we rather like this plush 15W Travel Set.</p> <p>The Watch charging part is separate but plugs in once the stand is unfolded; make sure you don’t lose it, though. When folded the charger can be used as a wireless charging pad. The iPhone can be set in either landscape or portrait orientation when the charger is doubling up as a stand.</p> <p>It’s lightweight and foldable, which makes it a great travel solution if you own iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch. The faster <strong>Kuxiu X40 Turbo</strong> is a more compact package for Apple Watch and iPhone owners because their Watch-charging modules are built-in.

The rubber anti-slip underside keeps the mat firmly in place.</p> <p>All Alti wireless charging desk mats come with a USB-C cable but require a charger; recommended 30W or higher.</p> </div> <p> Read our full <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3043213/journey-alti-lift-review-desk-mat-15w-qi2-charging.html"> Journey ALTI Lift review </a> </p> </div> <h2>Best wireless charging laptop sleeve</h2> <p>Protect your MacBook and charge your wireless devices at the same time.</p> <div> <p> </p><h2> Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve with Wireless Charging </h2> <p></p> <div> <div> <figure><img alt="Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve with Wireless Charging" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-NEXA-4-in-1-Laptop-Sleeve.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all"></figure> </div> <div> <div> <h3>Pros</h3> <ul>

<p>The premium-quality, vegan leather Journey NEXA laptop sleeve bills itself as a “4-in-1”, and it certainly is multi-functional.</p> <p>As well as protecting your laptop during travel, it includes two wireless chargers (one MagSafe compatible at 7.5W; one 5W for AirPods or a second phone) and can work as both a desk mat and mousepad to free your workspace of clutter.</p> <p>While it comes with a USB-C cable, you’ll need to add your own charger (check our roundup of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234733/best-usb-c-power-adapters-iphone-fast-charging.html">best iPhone chargers</a>) to connect with the USB-C port in the sleeve. Alternatively you can charge the MacBook itself while it sits protected in the sleeve—for this you’ll need a more powerful&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/819438/best-macbook-usb-c-charger.html">MacBook charger</a>.</p> </div> <p> Read our full <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2300958/journey-nexa-laptop-sleeve-review.html"> Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve with Wireless Charging review </a> </p> </div> <h2>Why wireless?</h2> <p>Wireless charging is convenient and fine for situations when you don’t need a super-fast recharge, although the latest 25W wireless chargers are getting close to the power and therefore speed you’ll get from charging via a cable</p> <p>If you’re leaving your home in 20 minutes and need as much juice as possible, plug in a cable (USB-C for iPhone 15 or later, or Lightning for earlier iPhones) into a USB-C charger (of at least 30W) to power up an iPhone faster than wireless. With 25W wireless chargers you can simply place your iPhone on and know you should be able to charge it to 50% in around 30 minutes.</p> <p>Wireless charging is less wearing than constantly inserting a cable into your phone, and more reliable as that vulnerable cable port can fill with fluff and dust after all the time spent in your trouser pocket or bag and it’s one of the most common reasons that an iPhone refuses to charge even when connected with a cable. It’s easy to clean with a toothpick (but please do it softly!) but will affect most of us at some time. Read our tips about <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2508804/how-to-clear-dirt-fluff-from-iphone-charging-port.html">how to clear dirt and fluff from your iPhone’s charging port</a>.</p> <p>Wireless charging isn’t affected by the build-up of dust and fluff in the phone port and is also less vulnerable to oxidation and corrosion.</p> <p>With wireless, you don’t have to remember to run around trying to find who’s taken your charging cable, and it’s certainly a lot neater.</p> <p>Of course, wireless charging is not really wireless, unless you are using a <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/668978/best-magsafe-portable-battery-packs-and-power-banks-for-iphone-12-and-13.html">portable magnetic power bank</a>. The magnetic charger is still connected by a cable to your wall charger; it’s just the connection to the phone that is properly wireless.</p> <h2>What else you need</h2> <p>Some magnetic chargers come with their own wall charger, but most require you to add your own. Apple recommends at least a 20W USB-C power adapter (wall-socket charger) and we agree unless your charger supports 25W wireless charging, in which case go with at least a 30 USB-C charger or higher if it’s a 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 multi-device charger.</p> <p>We have tested the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234733/best-usb-c-power-adapters-for-iphone-12-buying-tips-recommendations.html">best iPhone wall chargers</a> to help you choose a recommended solution.</p> </div> <div> <h3> <a href="https://www.macworld.com/author/sj"> Author: Simon Jary</a>, Contributor, Macworld </h3> <div> <p><img src="https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/author_photo_Simon-Jary_1654867285-38.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=150&amp;h=150&amp;crop=1"> </p> <p>Simon has over 30 years of expert experience testing and reviewing ever-smaller and more powerful tech accessories, from USB-C and Thunderbolt docks to chargers, batteries, hubs and adapters.

Moscow is demanding that <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/12/ukraine-sends-reserves-to-stop-russian-advance-in-east-amid-diplomatic-push">Kyiv pull its troops from the Donbas region</a>, including heavily fortified cities that sit atop vast natural resources, as a condition for any deal. It also wants international recognition for the land it has unilaterally annexed in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>Kyiv said the conflict should be frozen along the current front lines and has rejected a one-sided pullback of forces. Ukrainian officials are also demanding solid security guarantees against future Russian attacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova, reporting from Moscow, said people in the Russian capital do not seem to be too enthusiastic about the talks.</p><p>“The general public does not take this next round very seriously. The first two did not answer a lot of questions,” she said, referring to the territorial issues and the implementation of a ceasefire mechanism.</p><p>As both parties prepare for further negotiations, they are also ramping up military pressure.</p><p>Kyiv said it carried out a large-scale drone attack on energy infrastructure in western Russia on Sunday.</p><p>On Monday, the governor of the Bryansk region, Alexander Bogomaz, said Russian forces destroyed more than 220 drones. The strikes, which lasted more than 12 hours, were the heaviest since the start of the war, he said. Residents were temporarily left without heating.</p><p>Russian army chief General Valery Gerasimov said on Sunday his forces took control of 12 settlements in eastern Ukraine this month, an equivalent of 200sq km (77sq miles).</p><p>“The task of the military operation continues to be carried out. The offensive is under way in all directions,” Gerasimov said while visiting troops on the front line in the Ukrainian territory.</p></div></div>

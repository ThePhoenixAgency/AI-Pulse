<div><p><span>Summary created by Smart Answers AI</span></p><h3>In summary:</h3><ul><li>Macworld reports that iOS 26.4 beta introduces “Playlist Playground,” an AI-powered feature allowing Apple Music subscribers to create custom playlists using text prompts or song selections.</li><li>The update includes dynamic album backgrounds that match artwork colors and a new upcoming concerts feature showing nearby performances with ticket details.</li><li>These Apple Intelligence-powered enhancements represent significant improvements to Apple Music’s interface and functionality, though availability is rolling out gradually to beta users.</li></ul></div> <p>On Monday, Apple released the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3062548/ios-26-4-beta-features-install-release.html">first beta of iOS 26.4</a> for developers. Unfortunately, today’s beta still doesn’t include the long-awaited <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3058849/apple-just-cant-get-siri-working-right.html">new Siri powered by Gemini</a>, but it does come with another interesting AI-related new feature, especially if you’re an Apple Music subscriber.</p> <p>The iOS 26.4 update not only brings a new interface for albums and playlists, but it also delivers a new AI playlist feature, which should become available soon. Read on as we detail what’s new in Apple Music with iOS 26.4 beta.</p> <h2>Updated interface for albums and playlists</h2> <p>The Apple Music app is getting another interface tweak following the major redesign introduced with iOS 26 last year. Now, when users are viewing an album or playlist, the background will follow the color of the artwork instead of solid white.</p> <p>It’s not exactly a huge change, but it brings a breath of fresh air to Apple Music, making the experience a little more fluid and immersive.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Music-iOS-26.4.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Apple Music iOS 26 4"><figcaption><p>Apple Music has new colorful backgrounds for albums and playlists in iOS 26.4.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div> <h2>Concerts near you</h2> <p>Here’s another small but interesting detail about Apple Music in iOS 26.4 beta. When you open the app for the first time after installing the update, a message says that Apple Music can now show upcoming concerts near you.</p> <p>It’s unclear exactly how the feature works within Apple Music, but it’s likely be based on the same feature that already exists in the Shazam app (which is owned by Apple). With Shazam, users can view and save upcoming performances and ticket details as well as set reminders to be notified of tour dates.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Whats-New-Apple-Music.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Whats New Apple Music"><figcaption><p>You’ll be able to get tour information for your favorite artists in Apple Music’s iOS 26.4 update.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div> <h2>AI-generated playlists</h2> <p>But what really stands out in this update is the AI playlist feature. The feature is included in the iOS 26.4 beta code, but doesn’t seem to be enabled for all users yet.&nbsp;</p> <p>Based on the code, Apple Music subscribers will have access to “a new way to make playlists” using Apple Intelligence. The feature, called “Playlist Playground,” will generate playlists based on text prompts or even on the selection of at least 10 different songs.</p> <p>Users can describe what kind of songs they want in a playlist, which artists they want to listen to, or simply what vibe they like best. The code suggests that Playlist Playground is also capable of editing old playlists.</p> <p>Whether Playlist Playground will use Apple Intelligence or a third-party AI provider is unclear. For instance, Apple has already partnered with OpenAI to provide playlist generation on Apple Music through ChatGPT.</p> <p>The feature appears to be part of an Apple Intelligence update that is rolling out to users who update to the iOS 26.4 beta. It’s unclear how quickly Apple is rolling out the feature to users, but it isn’t available upon initial installation. </p> <h2>When to expect iOS 26.4?&nbsp;</h2> <p>iOS 26.4 beta also adds other new features, including encrypted RCS messages and video episodes on Apple Podcasts. Apple says the update will be released to the public this spring.</p> </div><div> <h3> <a href="https://www.macworld.com/author/filipe-esposito"> Author: Filipe Esposito</a>, Contributor </h3> <div> <p><img src="https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/author_photo_Filipe-Esposito_1745845436-10.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=150&amp;h=150&amp;crop=1"> </p> <p>Filipe Espósito is a Brazilian journalist who has been covering tech for over 10 years, and has become known for publishing exclusive reports on Apple's plans – such as the launch of the first titanium Apple Watch.

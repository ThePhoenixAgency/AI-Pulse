This is not an unfair advantage in either way, and many banks are now applying for OCC bank charters themselves to start offering bank-like products to their customers. </blockquote><figure>    <img alt="Banks, US Government, Stablecoin" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c58ec-230d-70ae-9bdc-7250a68f8be6.png" /><figcaption><em>White House crypto adviser Patrick Witt provides an update on the CLARITY bill negotiations.

The window is still open, but it is rapidly closing,” Witt said, adding that the White House Crypto Council is aiming to have the CLARITY Act signed into law before the midterms “take all of the oxygen out of the room.”</p><p><em><strong>Magazine: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/how-crypto-laws-changed-2025-further-2026/"><em><strong>How crypto laws changed in 2025 — and how they’ll change in 2026</strong></em></a></p></div><p>Cointelegraph is committed to independent, transparent journalism.

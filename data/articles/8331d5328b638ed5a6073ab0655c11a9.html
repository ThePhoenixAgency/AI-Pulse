						<p>With a pretty creepy looking style, the dungeon crawler Pluto is all about experimentation as you construct spells and wiggle your fingers. They've recently set a release date for March 9th, and a demo refresh is coming for Steam Next Fest on February 23rd.</p>
<p>Made by two developers that form indie team Siege Wizard Interactive (with the help of a few friends) and published by indie.io, Pluto blends turn-based deckbuilding with a tactile spell-casting system built around overlapping gestures and improvised combinations. No throwing cards at the screen here with you physically constructing spells, which they say turns "every combat encounter into a small experiment that can go very right–or horribly wrong".</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>

<p>From the press release: "We wanted to make a game that really felt like you were casting spells and are constantly improvising rather than playing the obvious move," said Brodie Lockard, co-creator. "Pluto is about exploring this intuitive system, navigating these interweaving paths to accomplish something small and personal in a world that really wants to kill you. Finding a path to your niece's birthday."</p>

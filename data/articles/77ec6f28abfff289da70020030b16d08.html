Your financial advisor helped you build a seven-figure portfolio, and now you're questioning whether those ongoing advisory fees still make sense. After all, the hard part is over, right?</p>      <ul><li> <p>Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — </p> </li><li> <p>Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now  — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how</p> </li><li> <p>I’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? </p> </li> </ul>   <p>Not quite. While many older Americans assume retirement marks the finish line, the transition from accumulating wealth to preserving, managing and distributing it introduces a new set of risks and decisions that can significantly impact your long-term financial security.</p>         <p>According to research from Thrivent, one of the biggest threats retirees face is sequence of returns risk (1).</p>   <p>This occurs when market downturns strike early in retirement, forcing retirees to sell investments at depressed values to fund living expenses. Even if markets eventually recover, those early, irreversible losses can permanently reduce a portfolio's longevity.</p>   <p>Withdrawal sequencing — the strategic order in which different account types are accessed — presents another critical complexity. Taking money from the wrong account at the wrong time can trigger unnecessary or avoidable tax bills.</p>      <p>Retirement Researcher explains that optimizing a withdrawal strategy requires understanding how taxable accounts, tax-deferred retirement accounts, and Roth accounts interact (2).</p>   <p>Rising healthcare costs and potential long-term care expenses can devastate even substantial savings, while longevity risk — the possibility of outliving your money — looms larger as life expectancies continue to increase.</p>   <p><strong>Read More: The average net worth of Americans is a surprising $620,654. But it almost means nothing. </strong></p>      <p>Before deciding whether to cut ties with your advisor, understanding what you're paying is critical.</p>   <p>According to the 2024 Kitces Report, as cited by SmartAsset, advisors who charge based on assets under management (AUM) typically do a rate around 1% on portfolios up to $1 million, with rates generally declining beyond that threshold (3).</p>    <p>On a $1 million portfolio, that 1% fee translates to $10,000 per year. Over a 20-year retirement, assuming continued portfolio growth, total fees could reach $300,000 or more. That's a substantial amount of money coming out of your pocket.</p>  </div> <span> </span>  </article>      <section><header> </header>  <div><ul> <p>Weʼre unable to load stories right now.</p>  </ul></div> </section></div></div>

While many older Americans assume retirement marks the finish line, the transition from accumulating wealth to preserving, managing and distributing it introduces a new set of risks and decisions that can significantly impact your long-term financial security.</p>         <p>According to research from Thrivent, one of the biggest threats retirees face is sequence of returns risk (1).</p>   <p>This occurs when market downturns strike early in retirement, forcing retirees to sell investments at depressed values to fund living expenses. Even if markets eventually recover, those early, irreversible losses can permanently reduce a portfolio's longevity.</p>   <p>Withdrawal sequencing — the strategic order in which different account types are accessed — presents another critical complexity. Taking money from the wrong account at the wrong time can trigger unnecessary or avoidable tax bills.</p>      <p>Retirement Researcher explains that optimizing a withdrawal strategy requires understanding how taxable accounts, tax-deferred retirement accounts, and Roth accounts interact (2).</p>   <p>Rising healthcare costs and potential long-term care expenses can devastate even substantial savings, while longevity risk — the possibility of outliving your money — looms larger as life expectancies continue to increase.</p>   <p><strong>Read More: The average net worth of Americans is a surprising $620,654.

Over a 20-year retirement, assuming continued portfolio growth, total fees could reach $300,000 or more.

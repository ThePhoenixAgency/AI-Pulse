From Apple Music and Messages to security tools and the App Store, the software introduces both visible redesigns and deeper functional upgrades. If you are testing the beta, you will notice improvements in media playback, messaging security, personalization, and device protection.</p> <p>The build number for iOS 26.4 beta 1 is <strong>23E5207q</strong>. Developers can install it by going to <strong>Settings</strong>, tapping <strong>General</strong>, and selecting <strong>Software Update</strong>. While this release targets developer testing, it clearly signals a feature-packed public rollout in the coming weeks. Here is a detailed look at everything new in iOS 26.4 beta.</p> <h2>Messages</h2> <p>iOS 26.4 beta adds support for testing encrypted RCS messaging. Right now, this feature works for iPhone-to-iPhone RCS testing. Apple is expanding encrypted communication standards beyond traditional iMessage, which marks an important step toward broader interoperability.</p> <p>The encryption layer focuses on secure message transmission during RCS testing. Although limited in scope for now, it reflects Apple’s continued investment in end-to-end security protocols.</p> <h2>Apple Podcasts</h2> <figure><img src="https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-gains-full-video-playback-in-iOS-26.4-creators-get-new-ad-tools-1024x576.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>Apple upgrades the Podcasts app with advanced video podcast capabilities. You can now switch more smoothly between watching a video podcast and listening to its audio version. The transition feels more fluid and integrated within the same playback interface.</p> <p>The system uses Apple’s HLS streaming technology, which automatically adjusts video quality based on your network conditions. As a result, playback remains stable whether you are on Wi-Fi or mobile data.</p> <p>Apple also introduces support for dynamic video ads in Podcasts. This allows content providers to insert adaptive advertising within video streams without interrupting the overall experience.</p> <h2>Apple Music</h2> <figure><img src="https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/iOS-26.4-Beta-Apple-Music-1024x576.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>Apple Music receives a visual and functional refresh in iOS 26.4 beta. Select albums and playlists now display full-screen animated artwork designed to create a more immersive experience.</p> <p>The update also improves music discovery with support for:</p> <ul>
<li>Finding concerts near your location</li> <li>Viewing tour dates for artists in your library</li>
</ul> <p>In addition, Apple redesigns the Profile section within the Music app. You now get faster access to account details and common actions. This updated Profile interface also appears in the App Store, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV, which creates a more unified design language across Apple services.</p> <h2>Playlist Playground</h2> <figure><img src="https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/iOS-26.4-Beta-Apple-Music-playlist-playground-1024x576.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>iOS 26.4 introduces Playlist Playground, a new Apple Intelligence feature inside Apple Music. This tool lets you create playlists using text descriptions or built-in prompts.</p> <p>For example, you can type a mood, activity, or theme, and the system generates a playlist based on your input. You can then refine the results without starting over, which makes playlist building more interactive and iterative. This feature highlights Apple’s deeper integration of personalized intelligence directly into media apps.</p> <h2>Wallpaper Gallery</h2> <figure><img src="https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/iOS-26.4-Beta-Wallpaper-Gallery-1024x576.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>Apple redesigns the Wallpaper Gallery with a cleaner layout and clearer category separation. The interface responds faster to taps and swipes, which improves navigation when browsing options.</p> <p>The updated wallpaper selection screen appears more structured, and users report visible refinements in how collections display. The change also aligns with broader visual updates seen across the system.</p> <h2>Reminders</h2> <p>The Reminders app gains a new Smart List dedicated to tasks marked as Urgent. This builds on the Urgent priority setting introduced earlier.</p> <p>When you label a task as urgent, the system:</p> <ul>
<li>Adds it to the new Urgent Smart List</li> <li>Sets an alarm reminder automatically</li>
</ul> <p>This improvement strengthens task prioritization and makes time-sensitive reminders more visible.</p> <p>iOS 26.4 adds a new Home Screen widget for Apple Music. The widget provides quick access to ambient music playlists, allowing you to start playback directly from the Home Screen without opening the full app.</p> <p>This small addition improves everyday usability, especially for users who rely on background music for work or relaxation.</p> <h2>Stolen Device Protection</h2> <p>Stolen Device Protection now activates by default in iOS 26.4. Previously, users had to enable it manually.</p> <p>When enabled, the feature:</p> <ul>
<li>Requires biometric authentication when you are away from trusted locations</li> <li>Enforces a time delay before completing certain sensitive actions</li> <li>Requires a second biometric authentication for critical changes</li>
</ul> <p>This default activation significantly strengthens device security, particularly in theft scenarios where passcodes alone are not sufficient.</p> <h2>App Store Changes</h2> <figure><img src="https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/iOS-26.4-Beta-app-store-1024x576.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>Apple adjusts the App Store layout in this beta. The Search bar returns to the top of the Search tab, and the Search tab now integrates directly into the bottom navigation bar instead of appearing as a floating button.</p> <p>Users also report:</p> <ul>
<li>A refreshed App Store account page design</li> <li>Removal of the separate floating search button</li> <li>Improved visual consistency</li>
</ul> <p>These changes streamline navigation and align the App Store interface with Apple’s broader design updates.</p> <div>
<figure><img src="https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_1812-721x1024.png" alt=""> </figure>
</div> <p>Contact pages now feature liquid glass-style buttons with improved contrast and readability. The design enhances visual clarity while maintaining Apple’s modern aesthetic.</p> <p>There are also refinements to wallpaper selection and the Freeform app icon. These adjustments reflect ongoing interface polishing throughout the system.</p> <h2>Personal Intelligence and Battery Controls</h2> <figure><img src="https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/iOS-26.4-Beta-apple-intelligence-1024x576.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>The Settings app now references personalized intelligence within the Apple Intelligence beta section. This signals deeper system-level personalization. In iOS 26.4, Apple seems to have broken the new Apple Intelligence. Many users have reported that it’s been stuck on “downloading” for hours now. </p> <figure><img src="https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/iOS-26.4-Beta-set-battery-charge-limit-1024x576.jpg" alt=""> </figure> </div> </section> </div></div>

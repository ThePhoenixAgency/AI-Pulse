<hr /><ul><li><strong>Ultrahuman may be about to release a new Ring Pro wearable</strong></li><li><strong>That’s hinted at by fresh paperwork filed with the FCC</strong></li><li><strong>It suggests Ultrahuman has worked a way around its past patent woes</strong></li></ul><hr /><p>Late last year, Ultrahuman’s <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/fitness-trackers/best-smart-ring">best smart rings</a> were <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/ultrahuman-smart-rings-have-just-been-banned-in-the-us-but-theres-better-news-for-ringconn-fans">banned from the US</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/fallout">fallout</a> from a patent dispute with Oura. At the time, Ultrahuman said that “A new ring design is already in development” – and a <a href="https://www.fccidlookup.com/fccid/2A99X-UHRINGPRO01" target="_blank">newly published regulatory filing</a> suggests that this product is almost upon us.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2026/02/15/ultrahuman-ring-pro-launch/" target="_blank">Gadgets &amp; Wearables</a>, the Ultrahuman Ring Pro has just been revealed in paperwork filed with the FCC in the US. The filing lists several specifications of the new device and suggests that Ultrahuman has made changes to avoid infringing the patents that got its previous products banned in the first place.</p><p>According to the regulatory filing, the Ultrahuman Ring Pro will sport multiple colors and finishes, including Pro Raw Titanium, Pro Matte Gray, Pro Silver, Pro Gold and Pro Aster Black. There are options ranging from ring sizes five to 14, and its internal diameter extends up to 24.91mm across.</p><p>The Ultrahuman Ring Pro utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy and contains a 2450 MHz chip antenna. There doesn’t appear to be any mention of NFC functionality, although that doesn’t necessarily rule out this feature, as it might have been disabled for testing.</p><p>The fact that Ultrahuman is seemingly back with a new device suggests that it has found a way around the patent dispute that led to its previous troubles. That’s hinted at by the fact that Ultrahuman has also submitted filings for a new charger for the Ring Pro, with the new design implying that the company has worked out a new internal design that does not infringe upon Oura’s patents.</p><h2>An imminent return</h2><figure><div><p>

</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Becca Caddy)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As soon as its rings were banned from import into the US, Ultrahuman reassured its users that it would be back with a new product. That appears to be the Ring Pro, which the filing suggests was tested in November 2025 and manufactured a month later. Considering the ban came into effect in October, that’s a fast turnaround for this new product.</p><p>At the time of the ban, Ultrahuman also raised the possibility of creating a ‘Made in USA’ version of its <a href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/fitness-trackers/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ring Air</a> that could be manufactured in Texas. There’s no indication that this is underway yet, so we’ll have to wait for more news on that front.</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><p>Now that the Ultrahuman Ring Pro has filed its paperwork with the FCC, it has cleared the last regulatory hurdle for entering the US market. While we don’t yet have a solid release date, we probably won’t have to wait too long to see Ultrahuman announce the Ring Pro. Gadgets &amp; Wearables points out that the filing’s confidentiality clause expires in May, suggesting that the Ring Pro should launch before then.</p><p>When that happens, it should enable Ultrahuman to put its patent woes behind it. That should give more certainty to fans of the brand who have been waiting for news on the company’s future offerings for several months now.</p><hr /><p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

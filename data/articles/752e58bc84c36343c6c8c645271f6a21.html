The <a href="https://amzn.to/4rgws14" target="_blank">Ridge 5-in-1 Magnetic Power Bank</a> aims to be the best all-around battery with great colors, built-in cables, and more.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/magsafe-monday">MagSafe Monday:</a></strong> Every Monday, Bradley Chambers looks at the latest and greatest in the MagSafe and wireless charging industry to help you get the most out of your Apple devices that support wireless charging.</p> <hr> <h2>Overall design of the Ridge 5-in-1 Magnetic Power Bank</h2> <p>I love the work Ridge has done on the design here. It comes in colors like Matte Olive, Basecamp Orange, and Matte Black. It feels rugged and fits right in with Ridge’s “everyday carry” aesthetic. It also features a built-in kickstand, which has become a must-have feature for me. Being able to prop up your phone to watch a video while it charges is incredibly useful, especially on a plane.</p> <h2>Built-in cables and capacity</h2> <p>The “5-in-1” name refers to its versatility with charging options. While it attaches magnetically to the back of your iPhone for wireless charging, the real winner here is the built-in cable management. It includes both USB-C and Lightning cables tucked neatly into the body. Even to this day, I’ll still have to find Lightning cables when traveling.</p> <p>My kids all have older AirPods they still use, and this battery will let me avoid bringing one. AirPod cases don’t have to be charged nightly, so they can top off mid-trip. Having both cables integrated means you don’t have to carry a rat’s nest of wires in your bag. With 10,000 mAh of capacity, you can get up to three full iPhone charges, which is plenty for a camping weekend and more.</p> <h2>Wrap up</h2> <p>Overall, it’s a solid MagSafe battery. The display for charging capacity is always a nice thing to have. I love how all the cables are built-in. It’s very much a one-stop shop for everything. It can deliver 15 watts over MagSafe, but when you need to charge even faster, it delivers 20 watts over USB-C. It can also do pass-through charging, so you can charge it overnight while charging your devices at the same time.</p> <p>You can buy it from <a href="https://amzn.to/4rgws14">Amazon</a> or directly from <a href="https://ridge.com/products/magnetic-power-bank-matte-black">Ridge</a>. Amazon only sells the black and orange colors, so if you want Olive, you’ll need to buy directly through Ridge.</p> <p><a target="_blank" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=https://9to5mac.com"> <img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/themes/ninetofive/dist/images/google-preferred-source-badge-dark.png" alt="Add 9to5Mac as a preferred source on Google"> <img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/themes/ninetofive/dist/images/google-preferred-source-badge-light.png" alt="Add 9to5Mac as a preferred source on Google"> </a> </p> </div></div>

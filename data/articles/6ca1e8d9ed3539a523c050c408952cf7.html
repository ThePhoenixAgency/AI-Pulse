<p>There's good news if want to upgrade to a cinematic <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/oled">OLED</a> TV on a budget! Among this year's <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-presidents-day-sales-deals">Presidents' Day sales</a> are two notable bargains that are back to the same prices they were over Black Friday: the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=trd-us-1077942792393469468&amp;sharedId=trd-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Flg-48-class-b5-series-oled-ai-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv-2025%2FJJ8VPZTK9F" target="_blank">LG B5 OLED TV now starts from just $599 for the 48-inch model at Best Buy</a>, while the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=trd-us-1153360440601950772&amp;sharedId=trd-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fsamsung-65-class-s84f-oled-4k-uhd-vision-ai-smart-tizen-tv-2025%2FJJGRF39ZVL" target="_blank">Samsung S84F OLED TV now starts at $899 for the 65-inch model</a>.</p><p>If that version of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/lg">LG</a> B5 is too small for you, then it's worth noting that you can get the <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FLG-Upscaling-Filmmaker-Orchestra-OLED65B5PUA-AUSZ%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-us-1378676182952452520-20" target="_blank">65-inch LG B5 for just $996 at Amazon</a> right now too.</p><h2>Today's best budget OLED deals</h2><p>The LG B5 is one of the best OLED TVs available right now, and pack in rich and premium image quality with a <em>ton</em> of useful features, including every key gaming feature you could want right now. We said in our <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/lg-b5-review">LG B5 review</a> that "once the B5 gets discounts, it will be a steal" – so here you are with a steal.</p><p>As I mentioned above, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/samsung">Samsung</a> S84F is effectively the same TV as the Samsung 85F, but with some features cut out. Most of these are related to smart home features of the smart TV software, but there's one that's more notable: there's no Filmmaker Mode. This is used by cinephiles (including us!) to get the most accurate picture out of TVs, but is by no means essential.</p><p>In our <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/samsung-s85f-review">Samsung S85F review</a>, we praised its "bold colors, crisp textures and strong contrast for a cheaper price" – adding that it's a superb TV overall, with "great picture quality, a stocked list of features and brilliant gaming performance".</p><p>Which one should you choose? Well, one key thing to note is that the Samsung S84F doesn't have Dolby Vision <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/hdr">HDR</a>, which the LG B5 does. On the flipside, the Samsung TV has HDR10+, which is a rival to Dolby Vision, and is starting to become more common on streaming services.</p><p>However, the Samsung is capable of brighter highlights in HDR, so it's capable of delivering even more pop and perceived higher contrast in some cases.</p><p>Our lead TV tester, James Davidson, put the two TVs we reviewed side by side for some direct comparison testing. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/i-tested-samsung-and-lgs-cheapest-oled-tvs-side-by-side-to-see-which-tv-comes-out-on-top-heres-what-happened">You can read the whole article in-depth article here</a>, but here's his conclusion:</p><p>"If you want a brighter, bolder-looking TV with more vibrant color, opt for the Samsung. If you want a more natural-looking TV with richer blacks, opt for the B5 … During my testing, I ultimately found myself more drawn to the S85F. So that’s the one I’d choose, but it was very close."</p><p>With today's deals, I think the best choice comes down to price and size – the LG is available in the smaller size for a super-low price; the Samsung is slightly cheaper at 65 inches, so is probably the one to go for.</p><h2>More of today's best Presidents' Day sales</h2><ul><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-us-7713521544375642672-20" target="_blank">45% off TVs, AirPods, air fryers &amp; vacuums</a></li><li><strong>Apple: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dapple%2Bstore%2Bsale%26hvadid%3D713790860351%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvexpln%3D67%26hvlocphy%3D9026250%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-us-3651179323039240894-20" target="_blank">iPads, AirPods &amp; MacBooks from $99</a></li><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=trd-us-4838707930078852974&amp;sharedId=trd-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Ftop-deals" target="_blank">$1,000 off TVs, laptops &amp; headphones</a></li><li><strong>Dell:</strong> <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-6361382-12578053?sid=trd-us-9410932165984102395&amp;url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/black-friday-deals" target="_blank">laptop deals from $249.99</a></li><li><strong>Home Depot:</strong> <a href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/c/221109/456723/8154?subId1=trd-us-6754417066082501353&amp;sharedId=trd-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.homedepot.com%2F" target="_blank">40% off appliances, furniture, grills &amp; tools</a></li><li><strong>Lenovo:</strong> <a href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/221109/218864/3808?subId1=trd-us-6008465007242527466&amp;sharedId=trd-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fd%2Fdeals%2Fdoorbusters%2F" target="_blank">45% off laptops &amp; tablets</a></li><li><strong>Lowe's:</strong> <a href="https://c.next2.io/?sid=11175396&amp;said=techradar.com&amp;partnerId=trd-us-2640610624869787406&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2F&amp;merchantId=199898&amp;fallback_url=https%3A%2F%2Flowes.sjv.io%2Fc%2F221109%2F897039%2F12374%3FsubId1%3Dtrd-us-2640610624869787406%26sharedId%3Dtrd-us%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.lowes.com%252F" target="_blank">up to 40% off appliances, furniture &amp; tools</a></li><li><strong>Samsung:</strong> <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&amp;mid=47773&amp;u1=trd-us-9663192184511238973&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Foffer%2F" target="_blank">up to $2,000 off appliances, TVs &amp; phones</a></li><li><strong>Target:</strong><a href="https://goto.target.com/c/221109/81938/2092?subId1=trd-us-4700637400972967087&amp;sharedId=trd-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fdeals-hub%2F-%2FN-4xw74%3Flnk%3DTopDeals" target="_blank"> 40% off clothing, tech &amp; furniture</a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=trd-us-1149477717280877998&amp;sharedId=trd-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals" target="_blank">furniture, cheap TVs &amp; vacs from $69</a></li><li><strong>Wayfair: </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-6361382-15735083?sid=trd-us-1807519884668922175&amp;url=https://www.wayfair.com/" target="_blank">54% off furniture, rugs &amp; decor</a></li></ul>

<div><p>Matt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones. It's a tough task, as you can imagine. Matt has over a decade of experience in tech publishing, and previously ran the TV &amp; audio coverage for our colleagues at T3.com, and before that he edited T3 magazine. During his career, he's also contributed to places as varied as Creative Bloq, PC Gamer, PetsRadar, MacLife, and Edge. TV and movie nerdism is his speciality, and he goes to the cinema three times a week. He's always happy to explain the virtues of Dolby Vision over a drink, but he might need to use props, like he's explaining the offside rule.</p></div>

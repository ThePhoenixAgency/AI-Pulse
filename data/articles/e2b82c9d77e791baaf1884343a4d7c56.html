Its skin is red with white stripes"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Epibatidine, which can be secreted by Anthony's poison arrow frog onto its skin, was blamed for Alexei Navalny's death by five European nations</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a deadly toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America, the UK and some of its European allies have said.</p></div><div><p>Traces of epibatidine were found in samples from Navalny's body and highly likely resulted in his death in a Siberian penal colony two years ago, the UK Foreign Office said.</p></div><div><p>The allies said only the Russian state had the "means, motive and opportunity" to deploy this lethal toxin.</p></div><div><p>The Kremlin dismissed the finding as "an information campaign", according to Tass news agency.</p></div><div><p></p><h2>What is the toxin?</h2><p></p></div><div><p>Epibatidine is a natural neurotoxin isolated from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog, according to toxicology expert Jill Johnson.</p></div><div><p>It was "200 times more potent" than morphine, she told BBC Russian.</p></div><div><p>Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America as well as being manufactured in a laboratory.</p></div><div><p>Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia, the European allies said in their statement.</p></div><div><p>Species known as Anthony's poison arrow frog and the Phantasmal poison frog are among those that secrete the toxin onto their skin.</p></div><div><p>Although epibatidine has been investigated as a painkiller and for relief from painful inflammatory lung conditions, it is not used clinically because of its toxicity.</p></div><div><p></p><h2>How does dart frog poison work?</h2><p></p></div><div><p>This powerful chemical compound acts on nicotinic receptors in the nervous system, according to Johnson.</p></div><div><p>Because it overstimulates these nerve receptors, if dosed correctly, it can cause muscle twitching, paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and ultimately death, she explained.</p></div><div><p>Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, told PA that its effects can result in breathing being blocked, and that "any person poisoned dies from suffocation".</p></div><div><p>The toxin being found in someone's blood "suggests deliberate administration", he added.</p></div><div><p>Epibatidine toxicity can even be "increased by co-administration of certain other drugs and these combinations have been researched", Hay said.</p></div><div><p></p><h2>How rare is the toxin?</h2><p></p></div><div><p>Epibatidine is extremely rare and found in only one geographic region and only in trace amounts, Johnson said.</p></div><div><p>It is understood the dart frog referred to by the UK Foreign Office and others was Anthony's poison arrow frog, a species endemic to Ecuador and Peru.</p></div><div><p>The frogs produce the chemical through eating the right foods to produce alkaloids - a type of organic compound - that make epibatidine and accumulate it in their skin. If the frog's diet changes, its epibatidine reserves will be depleted.</p></div><div><p>"Finding a wild frog in the right place, eating exactly the food needed to produce the right alkaloids, is almost impossible... almost," Johnson said.</p></div><div><p>"This is an incredibly rare method of human poisoning. The only other cases of epibatidine poisoning I know of were laboratory-based and non-fatal."</p></div><div><p></p><h2>What has Russia said?</h2><p></p></div><div><p>European laboratories confirmed Navalny died from the obscure poison, the allies said on Saturday.</p></div><div><p>Moscow has previously claimed Navalny died of natural causes, though Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya has consistently argued her husband was "murdered" by poisoning.</p></div><div><p>The Russian embassy in London denied Moscow was involved in Navalny's death and described the announcement as "feeble-mindedness of Western fabulists" and "necro-propaganda".</p></div><div><p>Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted by Russian state-run news agency Tass as saying: "All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems."</p></div><div><p>Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former UK and Nato senior officer, who is also a chemical weapons expert, said people should take anything the Kremlin says, including about Navalny's death, "with a pinch of salt".</p></div><div><p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Nato countries "have demonstrated that they have the evidence that Navalny was murdered by the state".</p></div><div><p>At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years and had latterly been transferred to an Arctic penal colony.</p></div><div><p>According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.</p></div></article></div></div>

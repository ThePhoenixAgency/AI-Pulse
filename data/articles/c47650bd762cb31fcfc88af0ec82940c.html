<div> <div><p>The Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch 2 nails a lot of the fundamentals. It delivers textured TMR thumbsticks that feel satisfying to use, it’s got an attractive semi-translucent design, and it's filled with plenty of battery life. However, the omission of rumble, NFC, and a 3.5mm port are a shame. In the end, it’s a very solid controller that’s pleasant to use; it just needs more expansive functionality for the price.</p> </div>

<h2><span>Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch 2 review: one-minute review</span></h2><p>Fancy a Rematch? That’s right, Turtle Beach is back with the Rematch Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch 2, which comes equipped with an all-new design, trusty C button, and a few other technical touch-ups.</p><p>I was also delighted with the controller’s generous 40-hour battery life, which competes with top controllers in our guide to the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/best-nintendo-switch-2-accessories">best Nintendo Switch 2 accessories</a>. Despite that, though, the Rematch certainly isn’t without its flaws.</p><p>One of the most glaring drawbacks is the controller’s omission of rumble technology. This can be crucial for certain in-game segments, and is generally a vital instrument to immerse players more deeply in their gaming experiences. I was also sad to see NFC tech left out, which lets you scan Amiibo in titles like <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a><em> </em>or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/kirby-air-riders-review"><em>Kirby Air </em></a><a href="http://riders.as/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Riders</em></a>.</p><p>When you combine those things with the Rematch’s lack of a 3.5mm port and its inability to wake your <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> console from sleep, I think it’s fair to say it's missing a few crucial features. And yes, although this model costs a fair bit less than the official Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, it's not exactly cheap. At more than $60 / £50 / AU$90, I’d hope for more expansive functionality.</p><p>All of that’s not to say that I disliked the Rematch – far from it. It’s a solid model overall that feels comfortable and effective in use, and the TMR tech is something that Nintendo’s official Switch 2 pro controller doesn’t have. And even with some missing features, it <em>does </em>support motion controls, which worked well in my experience.</p><p>Ultimately, I’d probably recommend waiting for a sale for this model. It’s a trustworthy, appealing controller that gets a lot of the fundamentals right, and it will almost certainly serve you well. At full price, though, I just feel that it’s a bit too thin on features.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fAz86EZzyKWZdL5cphW2bc.jpg" alt="Man holding the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch 2 and playing Mario Kart World">

This Nintendo-licensed controller will typically set you back $64.99 / £54.99 / AU$99 – that’s about $20 / £20 / AU$20 less than the official Switch 2 Pro Controller. You can purchase it with the Mario design – pictured throughout this review – or in a more basic Charcoal Black colorway.</p><h2><span>Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch 2 review: specs</span></h2><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Price</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>$64.99 / £54.99 / AU$99</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Weight</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>0.8lbs / 0.4kg</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Dimensions</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>6.3 x 5.3 x 2.6in / 160 x 135 x 65mm</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Compatibility</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Connection type</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Battery life</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>40 hours</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8V2ETcdtLjHBgZShjvMBbc.jpg" alt="USB-C port on the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch 2">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch 2 review: design and features</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Beautiful semi-translucent design</strong></li><li><strong>Remappable GL/GR buttons plus C button</strong></li><li><strong>No NFC support, no 3.5mm port</strong></li></ul><p>Looks-wise, I’m a big fan of the Rematch controller for Switch 2. It has a semi-translucent design and is adorned with the Super Mario logo, as well as the Italian plumber himself. It's beautiful, fun, and a bit more charismatic than the swathe of plain black controllers that dominate the market. Red details really cement the fact that this is a Mario-themed, Nintendo-licensed model too, which is a nice touch.</p><p>As nice as it looks, though, I would argue that the controller feels a touch cheaper than its price tag may suggest. It's got quite a plasticky build, and some components, like the D-pad for instance, just lack that premium finish you’ll get from Nintendo’s official Pro Controller.</p><p>That’s fairly understandable, given that the Pro Controller is $20 / £20 / AU$20 more expensive, but that cheaper build isn’t the only sacrifice you’ll make if you do indeed opt for the Rematch instead.</p><p>For instance, this model doesn’t have NFC technology built in, which means that you can’t make use of Amiibos in games like <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/donkey-kong-bananza-review"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a><em> </em>or <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em><a href="http://riders.as/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.</a> I understand that this won’t upset most players as much as me, but as an avid amiibo collector, this felt like a significant miss. Pair that with the lack of a 3.5mm port for a wired headset, and the omission of rumble (which I’ll discuss more down below), and you’re not getting the most feature-rich model on the market.</p><p>However, the Rematch controller does still have some commendable aspects, like its GL and GR buttons – these can be mapped to different controls for different games, and can come in handy for item management in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, for instance.</p><p>The C button in the center of the controller is also a big help if you want quick access to GameChat capabilities, something that you won’t find on a lot of third-party models.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PExoQo6FaJfjqDD96PGYZc.jpg" alt="Buttons on the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch 2">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch 2 review: performance</span></h2><ul><li><strong>TMR thumbsticks feel pretty good</strong></li><li><strong>A whole lotta battery life</strong></li><li><strong>Lack of rumble and can’t wake the console</strong></li></ul><p>The Rematch is an ergonomic, well-sized model with a pleasing weight to it, and it’s a very solid controller performance-wise.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest benefit of picking this controller over Nintendo’s official rival is that you’re getting TMR thumbsticks. This ensures strong responsiveness and precision, while also making stick drift less likely. More generally, the textured thumbsticks feel pretty good, and I experienced no issues with them across hours and hours of play.</p><p>In fact, most of the buttons feel pretty pleasing to use, whether that be the main face buttons, plus and minus controls, or the triggers. I especially appreciated the form of the ZL and ZR buttons, which slope upwards and are satisfying to press. The aforementioned GL/GR buttons are a welcome addition to boot.</p><p>My only real complaint when it comes to the buttons is some of the placements. For some reason, the home and plus buttons, as well as the minus and screenshot buttons, have been swapped around. To begin with, I found myself continually pressing the home button instead of the plus one, just out of sheer muscle memory. When playing with friends, I found that they would do the same, so this change felt more bothersome than anything.</p><p>Back to the good stuff, though, and I’m pleased to report that this controller delivers plenty of playtime. Turtle Beach says you get 40 hours from the Rematch, and from my time playing, I’d report that as accurate. That’s the same amount of time you’d expect to get out of the official Switch 2 controller, and competitive against other third-party controller manufacturers.</p><p>This model also supports motion controls, which I found to be surprisingly accurate. During my playthrough of <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, it was nice ‘n’ easy to grab star bits and navigate through menus – I still find the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/nintendo/joy-con-2-review">Joy-Con 2</a> controllers to be superior for motion-controlled games, however.</p><p>Having said that, Turtle Beach did leave a few functions out that could’ve put this controller's performance on par with the best of the best. For instance, there’s no rumble here, which is crucial for certain in-game mechanics and delivering a more immersive experience overall. You also cannot wake the console with the home button – something I love about my go-to controller, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/mobapad-n1-hd-nintendo-switch-pro-controller-review">Mobapad N1 HD</a>.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDpdYg5BkkZMjKFeSDEdhc.jpg" alt="Man holding the Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch 2">

<p>After a relatively quiet start to the year, things are about to pick up in the world of Apple. According to the latest reporting from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Apple has a range of new products set to debut in the coming weeks. Here’s what to expect.</p>



<h2>New Apple products coming soon </h2>



<p>Apple will unveil multiple new Macs and Mac-related hardware “over the course of the next several weeks,” according to <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023091274736365848"><em>Bloomberg’s</em> Mark Gurman</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>New low-cost MacBook powered by the A18 Pro chip</li>



<li>New M5 MacBook Air</li>



<li>New M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models</li>



<li>New Mac Displays</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/15/apple-cheaper-macbook-launching-next-month-with-a18-pro-chip-and-fun-colors/">new low-cost MacBook</a> will reportedly feature a display slightly smaller than 13 inches and will come in a range of colors. The <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/19/new-macbook-pro-release-date/">M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro updates</a> come following the launch of the <a href="https://geni.us/fM5r">base M5 model last fall</a>. The <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/10/new-macbook-air-coming-soon-heres-what-we-know/">M5 MacBook Air</a> is expected to be a spec bump without many other changes. Finally, Apple is reportedly working on a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/09/studio-display-2-coming-soon-with-at-least-four-big-changes/">least one new external display</a> for the Mac with a higher refresh rate and better picture quality.</p>



<p>Gurman <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/08/apple-m5-pro-m5-max-macbook-pro-new-launch-date/">previously reported</a> that Apple is aiming to launch the new MacBook Pros during the macOS 26.3 cycle, with a product announcement “slated for as early as the week of March 2.” Today, he reiterated that Apple is “preparing for an event that month.”</p>



<p>While those are the Mac-related announcements in the pipeline, Apple will also imminently multiple <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/2023093207547224190">other new products</a>. The <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/13/new-base-iphone-coming-soon-new-leak-reveals-key-specs/">iPhone 17e is</a> coming soon, as well as a new base model iPad and an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/06/apples-cheapest-ipad-to-get-apple-intelligence-support-at-just-the-right-time/">M4 iPad Air</a>.</p>



<p>All that to say: strap in, it’s going to be a fun few weeks in the Apple world. What are you most excited to see? Personally, I think that new low-cost A18 Pro MacBook has the potential to be one of Apple’s biggest product launches in a long time.</p>



<p>I’m also intrigued about Apple’s plans for the new external Mac display(s). This is a category Apple tends to neglect, even though a quality external display is something that’s crucial for Mac users.</p>

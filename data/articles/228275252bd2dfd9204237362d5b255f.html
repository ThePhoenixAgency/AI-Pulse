  <div class="content"><p>After a relatively quiet start to the year, things are about to pick up in the world of Apple. According to the latest reporting from Bloomberg, Apple has a range of new products set to debut in the coming weeks. Here’s what to expect. New Apple products coming soon Apple will unveil multiple new Macs and Mac-related hardware “over the course of the next several weeks,” according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman: New low-cost MacBook powered by the A18 Pro chip New M5 MacBook Air New M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro models New Mac Displays The new low-cost MacBook will reportedly feature a display slightly smaller than 13 inches and will come in a range of colors. The M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro updates come following the launch of the base M5 model last fall. The M5 MacBook Air is expected to be a spec bump without many other changes. Finally, Apple is reportedly working on a least one new external display for the Mac with a higher refresh rate and better picture quality. Gurman previously reported that Apple is aiming to launch the new MacBook Pros during the macOS 26.3 cycle, with a product announcement “slated for as early as the week of March 2.” Today, he reiterated that Apple is “preparing for an event that month.” While those are the Mac-related announcements in the pipeline, Apple will also imminently launch multiple other new products. The iPhone 17e is coming soon, as well as a new base model iPad and an M4 iPad Air. All that to say: strap in, it’s going to be a fun few weeks in the Apple world. What are you most excited to see? Personally, I think that new low-cost A18 Pro MacBook has the potential to be one of Apple’s biggest product launches in a long time. I’m also intrigued about Apple’s plans for the new external Mac display(s). This is a category Apple tends to neglect, even though a quality external display is something that’s crucial for Mac users. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments.

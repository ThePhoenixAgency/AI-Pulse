<p><strong>Key Insights (AI-assisted):</strong><br />
This partnership highlights how iSIM is moving from proof-of-concept into commercially scalable, ecosystem-backed implementations. Embedding nuSIM into Nordic’s cellular modules with pre-integrated Monogoto terrestrial and NTN connectivity reduces BOM, logistics, and provisioning complexity, which can materially lower deployment thresholds for high-volume IoT. It also shifts control toward software-defined connectivity models, where operators compete on APIs, policy and global coverage rather than plastic SIMs. The move reinforces a broader IoT trend toward deeply integrated silicon-connectivity-cloud stacks for massive, low-touch device fleets.

<h2>Monogoto and Nordic Semiconductor Launch Dedicated Partnership to Power the Future of Global Cellular + Satellite IoT</h2>
<p>Monogoto, the pioneer of programmable hybrid connectivity, announces a strategic cooperation with Nordic Semiconductor, a global leader in low-power wireless solutions, to accelerate the adoption of <strong>nuSIM</strong> (provided by Redtea-Mobile), an <strong>integrated SIM</strong> (iSIM) approach optimized for IoT devices.</p>
<p>As IoT devices become smaller, more power-efficient, and more globally distributed, the industry is shifting away from removable SIMs toward <strong>integrated SIM technologies</strong>. Through this collaboration, Monogoto and Nordic Semiconductor are enabling developers and device manufacturers to adopt nuSIM-ready designs that embed connectivity directly into the nRF9151 module, streamlining manufacturing, improving security, and delivering seamless global connectivity from day one.</p>
<p><em>“nuSIM represents a fundamental shift in how IoT devices are designed, manufactured, and deployed. It is part of the Software-Defined Connectivity revolution,”</em> said Maor Efrati, CTO at Monogoto. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By removing the need for a physical SIM and enabling embedding connectivity directly into the module, we remove friction across the entire lifecycle, from prototyping to mass deployment—all without compromising on security. Our collaboration with Nordic is about growing an open, scalable ecosystem where this integrated SIM technology enables secure, low-power, and future-proof IoT connectivity across terrestrial and satellite networks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The collaboration allows Nordic Semiconductor customers to leverage Monogoto’s cellular, satellite (NTN), and private network connectivity as part of an integrated connectivity experience aligned with nuSIM principles. The Nordic nRF9151-SMA-DK development kit is equipped with Monogoto connectivity, giving developers immediate, hands-on access to globally optimized connectivity without the complexity of traditional SIM provisioning or physical SIM handling.</p>
<p><em>“The future of IoT depends on tight integration between silicon, software, connectivity, and cloud,”</em> said Kristian Sæther, Senior Product Director Long-Range at Nordic Semiconductor. <em>“Integrated nuSIM allows companies to focus on innovation rather than SIM and connectivity logistics. By working with Monogoto, we’re giving our customers access to a global, reliable connectivity layer that complements Nordic’s low-power cellular solutions and supports the next generation of scalable IoT products.”</em></p>
<p>As the IoT ecosystem evolves toward massive scale, ultra-low power operation, and hybrid terrestrial-satellite coverage, integrated SIM technologies such as nuSIM are becoming essential. Monogoto and Nordic Semiconductor are jointly enabling this transition by lowering barriers to entry and fostering an ecosystem where connectivity is embedded, programmable, and globally accessible by design.</p>

<div> <hr><ul><li><strong>UK government says VPNs may be limited or age-restricted following three-month consultation </strong></li><li><strong>New powers will grant ministers the authority to implement rules more quickly </strong></li><li><strong>It remains unclear how VPN providers would technically enforce age checks</strong></li></ul><hr><p><em><strong>Update</strong></em><em>: This article was updated at 12:50 GMT to include commentary from civil liberties group Big Brother Watch.</em></p><p>The UK government has confirmed it may "age restrict or limit children’s VPN use" if the tools are found to undermine online safety protections.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-no-platform-gets-a-free-pass-government-takes-action-to-keep-children-safe-online" target="_blank">press release published yesterday</a>, the government vowed to "close loopholes that put children at risk" by introducing powers to implement internet safety measures more quickly following its three-month consultation.</p><p>While much of the focus remains on social media, the explicit mention of VPNs suggests restrictions on the privacy tools is increasingly likely.</p><p>Ministers are expected to table an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, granting them the authority to "act at speed." Any significant measures – such as enforcing age-verification for VPN providers – will still face a final vote in Parliament before becoming law.</p><h2>Critics sound the alarm</h2><p>Before the government's latest intervention, the House of Lords had already signaled its intent to clamp down on the privacy tools. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/uk-lords-propose-ban-on-vpns-for-children">Peers passed an amendment </a>to the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill that would force VPN providers to introduce "highly effective" age assurance measures.</p><p>However, this amendment is expected to be overturned in the House of Commons in favor of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/uk-government-targets-vpns-in-new-online-safety-consultation-as-lords-vote-for-ban">government's three-month consultation</a>.</p><p>VPN restrictions remain a point of contention among politicians. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/the-uk-war-on-vpns-is-an-embarrassment-backlash-grows-over-proposed-vpn-age-checks">Speaking to TechRadar last month</a>, Labour’s Lord Knight of Weymouth – who opposed the Lords’ amendment – suggested that while the rhetoric is sharp, few politicians are willing to "die in a ditch" over a VPN ban.</p><p>The proposal has already drawn fire from a number of prominent figures. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales said it was "an embarrassment," while digital rights organizations have warned that mandatory age checks could put "vulnerable people in immediate danger."</p><p>The UK-based civil liberties group <a href="https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/press-releases/big-brother-watch-response-to-government-plans-to-limit-childrens-access-to-vpns/" target="_blank">Big Brother Watch has called</a> the plans a "draconian crackdown" and argued that forcing all VPN users to undergo age assurance measures "defeats the point of a technology designed to enhance privacy online."</p><h2>What's next? </h2><p>In yesterday's press release, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall emphasized the importance of the move, saying that ministers are already consulting with parents and civil society groups.</p><p>According to Kendall, the message from families has been "consistent and clear" regarding the need for immediate action. Prime Minister Keir Starmer echoed this sentiment, saying the government was "closing loopholes that put children at risk, and laying the groundwork for further action."</p><p>Despite the government’s push for change, there appears to be a communication gap with the technology providers.</p><p>Last month,<a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/vpn-companies-open-to-meaningful-dialogue-with-uk-government-during-childrens-online-safety-consultation"> TechRadar spoke with representatives</a> from <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nordvpn">NordVPN</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/surfshark">Surfshark</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/windscribe-free-vpn">Windscribe</a>, and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/expressvpn">ExpressVPN</a>. They all confirmed that they were open to dialogue with the government. However, none of these major companies had been contacted by the government regarding the proposed restrictions at the time of the initial announcement.</p><p>The Prime Minister is scheduled to provide further details on these measures this week, marking the start of a process that could fundamentally reshape how VPNs are accessed in the UK.</p><p>We will continue to update this page as more details regarding the consultation and its impact on VPN access emerge.</p>

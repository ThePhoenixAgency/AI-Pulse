<p>Apple has released <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/tips/ios-26-3-released-everything-you-need-to-know-about/">iOS 26.3</a>, and the update carries a clear warning. You should install it as soon as possible because the release fixes 39 security vulnerabilities, and one of them is already used in real-world attacks targeting iPhone users.</p>



<p>The company kept most technical details limited for a reason. When vendors publish full exploit information too early, attackers quickly reuse it against devices that remain unpatched, so Apple delays specifics to give users time to update before criminals understand the flaw in depth.</p>



<p>On its <a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/126346">support page</a>, Apple confirmed that the exploited issue exists inside dyld, the Dynamic Link Editor responsible for loading system libraries during runtime, and the company wrote,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The flaw tracked as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-20700">CVE-2026-20700</a> allows arbitrary code execution. In practical terms, that means attackers can run their own instructions inside the operating system without permission, which opens the door to spyware installation, data theft, or device monitoring.</p>



<p>Because dyld sits deep inside the system startup process, an attacker who gains access there bypasses many security protections that normally block malicious apps.</p>



<h2>Link to earlier iPhone attacks</h2>



<p>Earlier updates already patched related WebKit issues. CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 were fixed in iOS 26.2 after a report from Google Threat Analysis Group. Those bugs helped attackers prepare the entry point, while the new dyld flaw appears to complete the intrusion chain.</p>



<p>Security researchers often see these multi-stage attacks where one bug opens the browser door and another takes full control of the device. With iOS 26.3, Apple closes the final step that attackers relied on.</p>



<h2>Do this</h2>



<p>Update immediately through <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Software Update</strong>. Devices that stay on older versions remain vulnerable to the same attack path already observed in targeted cases.</p>



<p>This release does not add visible features, but it blocks a confirmed active exploit, which makes it one of the most important updates in recent months.</p>

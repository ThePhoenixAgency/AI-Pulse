    <div><div><p>A former politician’s alleged sexual abuse of a young teen caused mental struggles for the boy as he tried to process what happened, a jury has heard.</p><p>Ex-state MP Rory Amon, 36, has pleaded not guilty to a swathe of criminal acts against a 13-year-old boy at a Sydney apartment complex in 2017.</p><p>The pair met up on a gay hook-up site before talking over Snapchat and arranging two meetings in a car park bathroom, where rape and other offences allegedly took place.</p><p>The now-22-year-old alleged victim returned to give evidence in front of a NSW supreme court jury on Monday.</p><p>Under questioning by Amon’s barrister Matthew Johnston SC, he said he would not have fully understood the first meet-up was for a sexual encounter.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p><p>“I was 13 – I didn’t really have a script for this kind of experience,” he told the jury.</p><p>Having earlier expressed excitement to a friend at the prospect of a romantic relationship, the short sexual encounter with Amon was not what he expected.</p><p>“I was developmentally not ready to be having sex, let alone with somebody twice my age,” the alleged victim said.</p><p>He divulged what happened to a friend soon afterwards, the jury heard.</p><p>“I feel like I was exposed to all of this way too early and it’s kind of hard to process,” he texted her over Instagram. “My anxiety about it is that bad and I get stomach pains.”</p><p>Johnston suggested his client had listed his age accurately as 27 on the dating site, not 17 as the complainant had testified.</p><p>“I am certain that that is not true,” the alleged victim replied.</p><p>The younger man admits lying about his age to sign up to the 18-and-over website. He lied again about his age to Amon later, testifying he presented himself as 15 years old.</p><p>Amon denies allegations he knew the complainant was under 16.</p><p>“I suggest to you, you communicated to the accused you were 17 years old,” Johnston said.</p><p>“I am certain that is not possible,” the alleged victim replied.</p><p>On Friday, jurors were told that Amon and the teen – who was in year 8 – met up twice in the apartment block’s communal bathroom, where a number of sexual acts allegedly took place.</p><figure></figure><p>The pair are alleged to have kissed, touched and had sexual intercourse.</p><p>On the second occasion, Amon allegedly brought along a towel so they could lie down on the bathroom floor.</p><p>Amon admits meeting with the teen on one occasion but says he never returned for a second visit – an assertion contested by the alleged victim on Monday.</p><p>“My memory serves me right … there were two incidents,” the now-22-year-old told jurors. The second occasion did not appear out of thin air.”</p><p>The complainant told his teacher, psychiatrist, parents and friends in 2017 about the alleged assaults.</p><p>He did not make a formal complaint to police until years later, after Amon became a local councillor and the boy realised the politician’s true identity.</p><p>The former MP has pleaded not guilty to 10 charges including five counts of having sexual intercourse with a child and two counts of attempted sexual intercourse with a child.</p><p>He also denies indecent assault charges.</p><p>The trial continues.</p><figure></figure></div></div>

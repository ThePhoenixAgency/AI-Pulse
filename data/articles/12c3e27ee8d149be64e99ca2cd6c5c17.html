The quarter started as a continuation of the post-Liberation Day risk-on market environment, while it ended on a strong note, driven by a positive macroeconomic backdrop. Attractive valuations, earnings recovery, broadening of the market, and a shift from mega-cap stocks supported small caps in the quarter. The Aristotle Small Cap Equity Fund (Class I-2) returned 1.96% in Q4 2025, trailing the 2.19% total return of the Russell 2000 Index.

href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/richard-tice">Richard Tice</a>, named today as Reform UK’s business and energy spokesperson, of promoting a Trumpian fantasy.</p><p>Commenting on Tice’s attack on net zero politicies, Uplift’s deputy director Robert Palmer said:</p><blockquote> <p>Tice is peddling a Trumpian fantasy. The geological reality is that after 50 years of drilling the UK has now burned most of its gas. Government projections show our reliance on imported gas is set to rise from 55% today to more than two-thirds by 2030, and over 90% by 2050. More drilling won’t make a dent in that. What will is, accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels.</p> <p>Reform continues to mimic Trump. Like the US president they are enthralled to the oil and gas lobby. The party is stuck in the last century - actively trying to block cheap renewable energy and denying that climate change is happening despite the evidence all around us.</p>

</blockquote><p>Abbott said former Downing Street chief of staff Morgan McSweeney “was very much of the opinion we had to chase the Reform vote” and that she hoped that his departure marked a turning point for the Labour party, at a time when it risks losing votes to the left.</p><p>Asked if she feared Labour risked losing Black voters, who were most likely to vote Labour in 2024, she said:</p><blockquote> <p>I think so … If people can’t see the Labour party speaking up for them, they’re going to sort of move away from the Labour party. It depends where you are, but certainly in London, to the Greens.</p>
</blockquote><p>Speaking of Jackson, she added:</p><blockquote> <p>He really is an inspiration to Black activists and politicians in the UK, certainly my generation of Black activists. What he taught us was to be brave – he had to be brave seeing his mentor, Martin Luther King, slaughtered in front of him. And to speak your mind – I’ve always spoken my mind, even when it gets me in trouble.</p>

(See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/feb/17/reform-farage-shadow-cabinet-local-council-elections-labour-starmer-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-69945ce28f08d2aff32f08a3#block-69945ce28f08d2aff32f08a3">12.24pm</a>.)</p><p>Farage was probably referring to the figures in <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/politics/rupert-lowe-restore-britain-jl-partners-poll-reform-uk-nigel-farage">this story</a> just published by GB News. The report by <strong>Jack Walters</strong> says:</p><blockquote> <p>Fewer than one-in-10 British voters can identify Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe, a new poll conducted exclusively for GB News has revealed.</p> <p>Polling firm JL Partners found Mr Lowe’s visibility has dropped from 14 per cent to just eight per cent in the 10 months after his expulsion from Reform UK in March 2025.</p> <p>Reform UK voters also struggled to correctly identify Mr Lowe when shown a picture of the former Brexit Party MEP, with the proportion jumping from 71 per cent last March to 86 per cent.</p>

The Press Association says:</p><blockquote> <p>The <strong>Department for Work and Pensions</strong> has for the first time published a breakdown of the proportion of claimants who have been switched to UC from so-called “legacy” benefits, such as income support and jobseeker’s allowance.</p> <p>The total number of UC claimants in Britain stood at 8.34 million in December 2025, up by almost a million from 7.36 million 12 months earlier.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/universal-credit-statistics-29-april-2013-to-8-january-2026/universal-credit-statistics-29-april-2013-to-8-january-2026">Data published today</a> shows that more than three-quarters of this increase (775,790) was due not to new claims, but instead were people who moved onto UC from other benefits.</p> <p>The government has said the roll-out of UC across Britain should be completed this year, with any claimants still on legacy benefits due to be moved to UC by March.</p>

</blockquote></article><article><header><h2>How Reform UK MPs are almost twice as likely to be privately educated as Tory MPs</h2></header><p>It is not hard to see why Nigel Farage reacted so badly when confronted with the question from Anna Gross from the Financial Times. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/feb/17/reform-farage-shadow-cabinet-local-council-elections-labour-starmer-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-699465ef8f08e43543db4e4d#block-699465ef8f08e43543db4e4d"> 1.07pm</a>.) She asked if British voters really wanted to see US Ice-style deportation units operating in this country. But her main question, addressed to Suella Braverman, the new Reform UK education spokesperson, was what her message would be to people worried about the party’s commitment to state education given that all five people on the platform today – now the party’s core leadership team – were educated at private schools.</p><p>Gross was highlighting the fact that, although <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Reform UK</a> is now a party getting much of its support from working-class voters, in parliament its MPs are far posher than those from the other parties, if educational background is taken as a key class metric.</p><p>This is confirmed by statistics set out in the recently published <a href="https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/The-British-General-Election-of-2024-by-Robert-Anthony-Ford-Tim-Bale-William-J-Jennings-Paula-Surridge/9783031969409?srsltid=AfmBOoqO9VTPwUsBuVKuhi22N5QaKmwPcTC-bf38R9J04dePQPmpztXh">The British General Election of 2024</a>, the definitive guide to what happened in the summer before last and the latest in a series of academic election studies going back to 1945.</p><p>The 2024 volume is written by <strong>Robert Ford, Tim Bale, Will Jennings </strong>and <strong>Paula Surridge</strong>, and this is what the say about the education background of the 2024 intake.</p><blockquote> <p>Close to two-thirds of MPs elected in 2024 attended a comprehensive state school – the highest ever recorded, though still well below the 90% figure among the electorate at large.</p> <p>Fewer than a quarter of MPs from the three largest Britain-wide parties were privately educated, a record low and down from over a third in 2015.</p> <p>And the school often seen as the pinnacle of privilege – Eton, alma mater of David Cameron and Boris Johnson – has never been less present in the corridors of power. The current parliament contains just four Old Etonians, down from 11 in 2019, 19 in 2015 and 53 in 1979.</p> <p>That said, the educational experiences of different parties’ MPs remain distinctive – and predictably so.</p> <p>While a narrow majority of Conservative MPs attended state schools for the third parliament in a row, the share of privately educated Tories actually rose in 2024 and continues to be much higher than for the other main parties.</p> <p>Labour MPs have been overwhelmingly state-educated since at least the 1970s, and Lib Dem MPs since the 2000s.</p> <p>By contrast, three out of the five Reform UK MPs were privately educated, making the populist rightwingers fond of railing against an out-of-touch establishment the only party with a majority of privately educated MPs.</p> <p>With little shift in the mix of educational backgrounds within each party, the overall jump in state-educated MPs has been driven by the turning of the political tides, as state educated Labour and Lib Dem challengers replaced privately educated Conservatives.</p>
</blockquote><p>Five Reform UK MPs were elected in 2024, and 60% of them were privately educated. Since then two of them have left the party: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rupert-lowe">Rupert Lowe</a>, who was privately educated, and James McMurdock, who wasn’t.</p><p>But the party has gained five MPs: Sarah Pochin, Danny Kruger, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/robert-jenrick">Robert Jenrick</a> and Suella Braverman (all privately educated), and Andrew Rosindell (who was state-educated). Kruger went to Eton. That means six out of eight Reform UK MPs – or 75% – are now privately educated. (The other two who are privately educated are Farage himself and Richard Tice; Lee Anderson was state-educated.)</p><p>As this chart from The British General Election of 2024 shows, for the Conservative party the figure is 46%.</p><figure><div><img alt="School background of MPs in 2024 intake" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee208ba86032731658cfcf061f8c1efe65ca4174/0_0_878_342/master/878.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span> Photograph: British General Election of 2024</figcaption></figure><p>The book is invaluable, as well as being a good read; it is the one election book that will stay on my desk for good.</p></article><article><header><h2>Labour says Reform UK now led by 'Farage's top team of failed Tories'</h2></header><p>Labour has described <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Reform UK</a> as a “top team of failed Tories”.</p><p>In a statement released after the Reform UK press conference, <strong>Anna Turley</strong>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> chair, said:</p><blockquote> <p>Farage’s top team of failed Tories spent over 3,000 days inflicting untold damage on our country in government, trashing our economy, hammering families’ mortgages, and leaving our borders open.</p> <p>They failed Britain before – they’d do the same again under Reform.</p> <p>Today’s appointments clearly reveal that neither keeping our nation safe nor tackling NHS waiting lists are priorities for Farage or Reform UK.</p>

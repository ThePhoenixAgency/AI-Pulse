on our country in government, trashing our economy, hammering families’ mortgages, and leaving our borders open.</p> <p>They failed Britain before – they’d do the same again under Reform.</p>

Do you support the MMR vaccine and agree it should not be part of a culture war?</em></p><p><strong>Farage</strong> said: “Yes, absolutely, 100%.”</p><p>He said he had always thought vaccines had done “a hell of a lot more good than harm”.</p><p>But he said that, during Covid, peopl were told the Covid jab meant they would not catch Covid again, or could not pass it on, and that “simply wasn’t true”.</p><p>He said the government at the time “told us that while they knew it wasn’t true”.</p></article><article><header><h2>'Just write some silly story' - Farage insults female FT reporter after she asks difficult questions</h2></header><p><strong>Anna Gross</strong> from the Financial Times asked a two-part question at the press conference: about whether <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Reform UK</a> would create an Ice-style migrant deportation unit, and about all five of the people on the platform having been educated at private schools.</p><p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong> responded. He said sarcastically that he “loved” the FT; the day after the Mandelson story broke, its front page carried a story about a Reform councillor in Kent, he said. He said there was not point addressing Gross’s question. “Just write some silly story,” he told Gross.</p><p>Farage has got form <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/18/labour-asylum-seekers-keir-starmer-reform-nigel-farage-uk-politics-latest-news?page=with%3Ablock-691c4bac8f08d34a5ebe3b26#block-691c4bac8f08d34a5ebe3b26">for patronising and insulting female journalist in this way.</a></p><p>(As well as patronising, Farage’s response was unfair. The FT pursued the story about Mandelson’s links with Jeffrey Epstein more aggressively than almost any other UK news organisation.)</p></article><article><header></header><p><em>Q: What do you think of Matt Goodwin, your candidate in Gorton and Denton, suggesting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/13/reform-matt-goodwin-fertility-comments-outcry-handmaids-tale">women who do not have children should be taxed more</a>?</em></p><p><strong>Farage</strong> said he would not want to see anyone taxed more in these circumstances. But he said he could see the case for linking tax breaks to having “quite a few children”.</p></article><article><header></header><p><em>Q: Do you think Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor should face a police investigation?</em></p><p><strong>Farage</strong> said “clearly” he should.</p><p>But he also said he wanted to learn more about Peter Mandelson’s links with Russia.</p></article><article><header><h2>Farage says there's 'nothing socialist' about Reform UK wanting state involvement in industries</h2></header><p><strong>Farage</strong> said that he did not accept that state involvement in some industries – a policy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Reform UK</a> favours – was “socialist”.</p><p><strong>Jenrick</strong> backed this up, saying he did not accept that reindustrialisation was socialist either.</p><p><em>UPDATE:</em> <strong>Farage</strong> said:</p><blockquote> <p>I don’t think state involvement in strategic industries is socialism.</p> <p>There’s nothing socialist about saying that the British government should maybe take a stake in some of these strategic industries. That’s not nationalisation, far, far from it.</p>
</blockquote><p>And <strong>Jenrick</strong> said:</p><blockquote> <p>There’s nothing socialist about saying that our economy should be concerned about salvaging strategic industries like steel or carmaking. We’re losing those strategic industries now.</p>

But Suella Braverman is talking about gettin</em><em>g rid of the Equality Act. If you get rid of those protections, will it lead to fewer women having children?</em></p><p><strong>Suella Braverman</strong> said she wanted to get rid of the Equality Act to get rid of the “pernicious, divisive notion of protected characteristics”.</p><p>But that did not mean she wanted to get rid of all employment protection, she said.</p></article><article><header></header><p><em>Q: Do you want to reduce the proportion of the economy devoted to services?</em></p><p><strong>Richard Tice</strong> said he wanted to grow the whole economy.

Do you agree?</em></p><p><strong>Farage</strong> said that was not his view. In parties, sometimes people disagree, he said</p><p>He went on:</p><blockquote> <p>Look, I’ve no intention of doing a deal and shaking hands with people that I believe to be utterly dishonourable. And that is how I view the Conservative Party.</p>
</blockquote><p>He said he felt “betrayed” by what the Tories did on Brexit after 2019.</p><blockquote> <p>I’ve been in business a long time. I do lots of deals. Some are successful, some are failures. But you know what I do? I look people in the eye. I shake their hands because I trust them. I do not trust this Conservative party.</p>
</blockquote><p>He said that Kemi Badenoch was “facing both ways at the same time” on Labour cancelling local elections – opposing the policy nationally, while allowing Tory councils to ask for elections to be delayed.</p></article><article><header><h2>Farage says Rupert Lowe's claim his new party at 10% in polls 'utter rot'</h2></header><p><em>Q: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rupert-lowe">Rupert Lowe</a> claims Restore Britain is now polling at 10%.</em></p><p><strong>Farage</strong> says polling out later today will show that Lowe’s recognition is “not very high at all”. So <a href="https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2022767014364762165">the claim that he is at 10%</a> is “utter rot”, he says. He goes on:</p><p>He won’t be on 1% anywhere.

    <div><div><p>Dancing humanoid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/robots">robots</a> took centre stage on Monday during the annual China Media Group’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s most-watched official television broadcast. They lunged and backflipped (landing on their knees), they spun around and jumped. Not one fell over.</p><p>The display was impressive, but prompted some to wonder: if robots can now dance and perform martial arts, what else can they do?</p><p>Experts have mixed opinions, with some saying the robots had limitations and that the display should be viewed through a lens of state propaganda.</p><figure></figure><p>Developed by several Chinese robotics firms, the robots performed a range of intricate stunts, including kung fu, comedy sketches and choreographed dance moves alongside human performers.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Rainmaker1973/status/2023449713333158116?s=20">Clips</a> <a href="https://x.com/TansuYegen/status/2023399348672020649?s=20">circulating</a> online quickly drew comparisons with last year’s lunar new year broadcast, which also featured dancing robots but with noticeably simpler movements.</p><figure><div><img alt="Robots dance with children in China" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/105e349dd71d920ebf5fd841e36560975192b881/0_0_1920_1080/master/1920.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>The performance showed China’s push to develop more advanced robots powered by improved AI capabilities.</span> Photograph: CCTV Video News Agency/Youtube</figcaption></figure><p>Kyle Chan, an expert in China’s technology development at Brookings Institution, a policy organisation in Washington DC, said Beijing uses these public robot performances to “dazzle domestic and international audiences with China’s technological prowess”.</p><p>“Unlike AI models or industrial equipment, humanoid robots are highly visible examples of China’s technological leadership that general audiences can see on their phones or televisions,” he said.</p><p>Pointing to intensifying competition in the tech space between China and the US, Chan added: “While China and the US are neck-and-neck on AI, humanoid robots are an area where China can claim to be ahead of the US, particularly in terms of scaling up production.”</p><p>Georg Stieler, the head of robotics and automation at the global technology consulting firm Stieler Technology and Marketing, also emphasised the symbolism of China’s prime time broadcast.</p><p>“What distinguishes the gala from comparable events elsewhere is the directness of the pipeline from industrial policy to prime-time spectacle,” Stieler said in a statement.</p><p>Comparing this year’s performances with last year’s – when viewers saw “fundamentally a single choreographic mode” with limited motions including walking, twisting and kicking – Stieler said one key signal of China’s robot progress is “the ability to run large numbers of near-identical humanoids in synchronised motion with stable gaits and consistent joint behaviour”.</p><p>But Stieler also noted: “Stage performance does not equate to industrial robustness, yet.” He said what the robots did was the result of being trained for a routine “hundreds or thousands of times – you could not just tell them to change direction or do something completely different”.</p><p>“These dance motions involve very little environmental perception and are essentially imitation learning plus a balance-keeping controller. That has little bearing on reliability in unstructured environments, a prerequisite for factory-grade deployment. Also the progress in dexterity is not as fast as in locomotion,” he added.</p><p>The unveiling of China’s latest generation of robots underscores the country’s broader technological ambitions.</p><p>By the end of 2024, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> had registered 451,700 smart robotics companies, with a total capital of 6.44tn yuan (approximately $932.16bn), according to <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202502/10/WS67a99669a310a2ab06eab353.html">state data</a>. Major government projects such as Made in China 2025 and the 14th Five-Year Plan, have made robotics and AI key Beijing priorities.</p><p>Morgan Stanley projects that China’s humanoid sales will more than double to 28,000 units in 2026; and Elon Musk has said he expects his biggest competitor to be Chinese companies as he pivots Tesla toward a focus on embodied AI and its flagship humanoid Optimus. “People outside China underestimate China, but China is an ass-kicker next level,” Musk said last month.</p><p>Marina Zhang, a technology professor at the University of Technology Sydney, said that such a visible showcase likely hints at a new phase in China’s manufacturing masterplan, “where robotics becomes a linchpin in the shift from low-cost assembly to high-end, smart manufacturing”.</p><p><em>With Reuters</em></p></div></div>

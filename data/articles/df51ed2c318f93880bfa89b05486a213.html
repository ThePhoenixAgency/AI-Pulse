						<p>Log Riders is a co-op platformer around running on top of wooden logs, it looks hilarious and now there's full Native Linux support too. It released originally on February 12th, with the latest update adding both Linux and macOS support.</p>
<p>Based on feedback they've also tweaked the difficulty, along with adding a new "Easy" difficulty mode choice that has more checkpoints. Steam Community items like trading cards, backgrounds and more are also on the way for it.</p>
<p>A game that's all about working together, to keep your balance as you roll over all sorts of different terrain and overcome various different types of obstacles. Communication will be key in this one, and no doubt plenty of laughs as you repeatedly fall off.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer below:<wbr></wbr></p>

<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EVERYTHING IS ABOUT BALANCE</strong></p>
<p>All these two lumberjacks need to do is stay balanced on the log they keep rolling forward. Oh, and one more thing… They also have to overcome the obstacles ahead of them.</p>
<p><strong>TWO STEPS FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK</strong></p>
<p>Players can move the lumberjacks forward and backward, allowing them to maneuver the log. Be careful though, rolling the log in the same direction can turn it into something as fast as a race car, and that speed can easily throw off your balance…</p>
<p><strong>A PHYSICS-DRIVEN WORLD</strong></p>
<p>The balance of the log you roll is simulated by a physics system that closely resembles real life, making the experience much more challenging. Characters react realistically to collisions, falls and other physical interactions thanks to ragdoll physics.</p>
<p><strong>I LOVE HANDLEBAR MUSTACHES</strong></p>
<p>Throughout this adventure, you can collect coins from chests and use them to customize your character. Lumberjacks, for example, really like handlebar mustaches. What do you like?</p>
<p><strong>LOCAL MULTIPLAYER AND CO-OP</strong></p>
<p>This is a two-player adventure. You can play solo or together on the same device using different sides of the keyboard or connect to a game hosted on another device and play cooperatively.</p>
<p><strong>DIFFICULTY LEVELS AND CHECKPOINTS</strong></p>
<p>The difficulty levels affect how often checkpoints appear. As you pass checkpoint flags on the map, the game is saved automatically, allowing you to continue from where you left off whenever you want. No need to make things too hard, right?</p>
<p><strong>LEADERBOARD</strong></p>
<p>Players can compete via the global leaderboard and see who completes the game in the shortest time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could be a good one for your next game night with a friend or partner!</p>

<p></p><h2>AI should magnify everyone—not just the top 1%.</h2><a href="#ai-should-magnify-everyonenot-just-the-top-1"></a><p></p>
</div>
<p></p><h2>The Purpose of This Project</h2><a href="#the-purpose-of-this-project"></a><p></p>
<p><strong>PAI exists to solve what I believe is the <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/telos">P0 problem</a> in the world:</strong></p>
<p></p><h3>Only a tiny fraction of humanity's creative potential is activated on Earth.</h3><a href="#only-a-tiny-fraction-of-humanitys-creative-potential-is-activated-on-earth"></a><p></p>
<p>Most people don't believe they have valuable contributions to make. They think there are "special" people—and they aren't one of them. They've never asked who they are, what they're about, and have never articulated or written it down. This makes them catastrophically vulnerable to AI displacement. Without activation, there is no high-agency.</p>
<p>So our goal with PAI is to activate people.</p>
<p><strong>PAI's mission is twofold:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Activate as many people as possible</strong> — Help people identify, articulate, and pursue their own purpose in life through AI-augmented self-discovery</li>
<li><strong>Make the best AI available in the world accessible to everyone</strong> — Ensure this quality of AI infrastructure isn't reserved for just the rich or technical elite.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's why this is an open-source project instead of private.</p>

<p></p><h2>New to This? Start Here</h2><a href="#new-to-this-start-here"></a><p></p>
<p>You've probably used ChatGPT or Claude. Type a question, get an answer. Simple.</p>
<p>You can think of AI systems as <strong>three levels</strong>:</p>
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/images/pai-eli5-diagram.png"><img src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/raw/main/images/pai-eli5-diagram.png" alt="The AI Evolution - From chatbots to your personal AI system" /></a>
</p>
<p></p><h3>Chatbots</h3><a href="#chatbots"></a><p></p>
<p>ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini—you ask something, it answers, and then it forgets everything. Next conversation starts fresh. No memory of you, your preferences, or what you talked about yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>The pattern:</strong> Ask → Answer → Forget</p>
<p></p><h3>Agentic Platforms</h3><a href="#agentic-platforms"></a><p></p>
<p>Tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. The AI can actually <em>do</em> things—write code, browse the web, edit files, run commands.</p>
<p><strong>The pattern:</strong> Ask → Use tools → Get result</p>
<p>More capable, but it still doesn't know <em>you</em>—your goals, your preferences, your history.</p>
<p></p><h3>PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure)</h3><a href="#pai-personal-ai-infrastructure"></a><p></p>
<p>Now your DA <strong>learns and improves</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Captures every signal</strong> — Ratings, sentiment, verification outcomes</li>
<li><strong>Learns from mistakes</strong> — Failures get analyzed and fixed</li>
<li><strong>Gets better over time</strong> — Success patterns get reinforced</li>
<li><strong>Upgrades itself</strong> — Skills, workflows, even the core behavior evolves</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus it knows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your goals</strong> — What you're working toward</li>
<li><strong>Your preferences</strong> — How you like things done</li>
<li><strong>Your history</strong> — Past decisions and learnings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The pattern:</strong> Observe → Think → Plan → Execute → Verify → <strong>Learn</strong> → Improve</p>
<p>The key difference: <strong>PAI learns from feedback</strong>. Every interaction makes it better at helping <em>you</em> specifically.</p>
<hr />
<p></p><h2>What is PAI?</h2><a href="#what-is-pai"></a><p></p>
<p>PAI is a Personalized AI Platform designed to magnify your capabilities.</p>
<p>It's designed for humans most of all, but can be used by teams, companies, or Federations of Planets desiring to be better versions of themselves.</p>
<p>The scale of the entity doesn't matter: It's a system for understanding, articulating, and realizing its principal's goals using a full-featured Agentic AI Platform.</p>
<p></p><h3>Who is PAI for?</h3><a href="#who-is-pai-for"></a><p></p>
<p><strong>Everyone, full stop.</strong> It's the anti-gatekeeping AI project.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small business owners</strong> who aren't technical but want AI to handle invoicing, scheduling, customer follow-ups, and marketing</li>
<li><strong>Companies</strong> who want to understand their data, optimize operations, and make better decisions</li>
<li><strong>Managers</strong> who want to run their teams more effectively—tracking projects, preparing for reviews, and communicating clearly</li>
<li><strong>Artists and creatives</strong> who want to find local events, galleries, and opportunities to showcase their work</li>
<li><strong>Everyday people</strong> who want to improve their lives—better fitness routines, stronger social connections, personal finance, or just getting organized</li>
<li><strong>Developers</strong> using AI coding assistants who want persistent memory and custom workflows</li>
<li><strong>Power users</strong> who want their AI to know their goals, preferences, and context</li>
<li><strong>Teams</strong> building shared AI infrastructure with consistent capabilities</li>
<li><strong>Experimenters</strong> interested in AI system design and personal AI patterns</li>
</ul>
<p></p><h3>What makes PAI different?</h3><a href="#what-makes-pai-different"></a><p></p>
<p>The first thing people ask is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is this different from Claude Code, or any of the other agentic systems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most agentic systems are built around tools with the user being an afterthought. They are also mostly task-based instead of being goal-based using all the context available to them. PAI is the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>Three core differentiators:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal Orientation</strong> — PAI's primary focus is on the human running it and what they're trying to do in the world, not the tech. This is built into how the system executes all tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pursuit of Optimal Output</strong> — The system's outer loop and everything it does is trying to produce the exact right output given the current situation and all the contexts around it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Learning</strong> — The system constantly captures signals about what was done, what changes were made, what outputs were produced for each request, and then how you liked or disliked the results.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p></p><h2>PAI Primitives</h2><a href="#pai-primitives"></a><p></p>
<p>While the Principles describe the <em>philosophy</em> of PAI, the Primitives are the <em>architecture</em>—the core systems that make everything work.</p>
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/images/pai-unique-components-diagram.png"><img src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/raw/main/images/pai-unique-components-diagram.png" alt="PAI Primitives - A system that knows you, not a tool harness" /></a>
</p>
<p>These primitives work together to create the experience of working with a system that understands and knows you—as opposed to a tool harness that just executes commands.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/images/pai-component-1-assistant-vs-agent.png"><img src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/raw/main/images/pai-component-1-assistant-vs-agent.png" alt="Assistant vs Agent-Based Interaction" /></a>
</p>
<p></p><h3>Assistant vs. Agent-Based AI Interaction</h3><a href="#assistant-vs-agent-based-ai-interaction"></a><p></p>
<p>PAI treats AI as a <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/personal-ai-maturity-model">persistent assistant, friend, coach, and mentor</a> rather than a stateless agent that runs tasks. An assistant knows your goals, remembers your preferences, and improves over time. An agent executes commands and forgets.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/images/pai-primitive-telos.png"><img src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/raw/main/images/pai-primitive-telos.png" alt="TELOS - Deep Goal Understanding" /></a>
</p>
<p></p><h3>TELOS (Deep Goal Understanding)</h3><a href="#telos-deep-goal-understanding"></a><p></p>
<p>10 files that capture who you are: MISSION.md, GOALS.md, PROJECTS.md, BELIEFS.md, MODELS.md, STRATEGIES.md, NARRATIVES.md, LEARNED.md, CHALLENGES.md, IDEAS.md. Your DA knows what you're working toward because it's all documented.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/images/pai-primitive-user-system-separation.png"><img src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/raw/main/images/pai-primitive-user-system-separation.png" alt="User/System Separation" /></a>
</p>
<p></p><h3>User/System Separation</h3><a href="#usersystem-separation"></a><p></p>
<p>Your customizations live in USER/. PAI infrastructure lives in SYSTEM/. When PAI upgrades, your files are untouched. Portable identity, upgrade-safe.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/images/pai-primitive-customization.png"><img src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/raw/main/images/pai-primitive-customization.png" alt="Granular Customization" /></a>
</p>
<p></p><h3>Granular Customization</h3><a href="#granular-customization"></a><p></p>
<p>Six layers of customization: Identity (name, voice, personality), Preferences (tech stack, tools), Workflows (how skills execute), Skills (what capabilities exist), Hooks (how events are handled), and Memory (what gets captured). Start with defaults, customize when needed.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/images/pai-component-2-skill-system.png"><img src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/raw/main/images/pai-component-2-skill-system.png" alt="Skill System" /></a>
</p>
<p></p><h3>Skill System</h3><a href="#skill-system"></a><p></p>
<p>Highly focused on consistent results. It has a structure that puts <em>deterministic outcomes first</em> by going from CODE -&gt; CLI-BASED-TOOL -&gt; PROMPT -&gt; SKILL instead of a haphazard structure.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/images/pai-component-3-memory-system.png"><img src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/raw/main/images/pai-component-3-memory-system.png" alt="Memory System" /></a>
</p>
<p></p><h3>Memory System</h3><a href="#memory-system"></a><p></p>
<p>Focused on continuous learning. Every interaction generates signals—ratings, sentiment, successes, failures—that feed back into improving the system. Three-tier architecture (hot/warm/cold) with phase-based learning directories.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/images/pai-component-6-hook-system.png"><img src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/raw/main/images/pai-component-6-hook-system.png" alt="Hook System" /></a>
</p>
<p></p><h3>Hook System</h3><a href="#hook-system"></a><p></p>
<p>Responds to lifecycle events—session start, tool use, task completion, and more. 8 event types enable voice notifications, automatic context loading, session capture, security validation, and observability.</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/images/pai-component-5-security-system.png"><img src="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/raw/main/images/pai-component-5-security-system.png" alt="Security System" /></a>
</p>
<p></p><h3>Security System</h3><a href="#security-system"></a><p></p>
<p>Defines system and user-level security policies by default. You don't have to run with <code>--dangerously-skip-permissions</code> to have an uninterrupted experience. PAI's security hooks validate commands before execution, blocking dangerous operations while allowing normal workflows to proceed smoothly.</p>

</p>
<p></p><h3>AI-Based Installation</h3><a href="#ai-based-installation"></a><p></p>
<p>Your AI assistant reads the packs, understands your system, and installs everything for you. No manual configuration, no guessing—the AI handles it.</p>

</p>
<p></p><h3>Notification System</h3><a href="#notification-system"></a><p></p>
<p>Keeps you informed without being intrusive. Push notifications via ntfy for mobile alerts, Discord integration for team updates, and duration-aware routing that escalates for long-running tasks. Fire-and-forget design means notifications never block your workflow.</p>
<hr />
<p>

</p>
<p></p><h3>Voice System</h3><a href="#voice-system"></a><p></p>
<p>Powered by ElevenLabs TTS. Hear task completions, session summaries, and important updates spoken aloud. Prosody enhancement makes speech sound natural. Your AI has a voice.</p>

</p>
<p></p><h3>Terminal-Based UI</h3><a href="#terminal-based-ui"></a><p></p>
<p>Rich tab titles and pane management. Dynamic status lines show learning signals, context usage, and current task state. Your terminal is a command center.</p>

<p></p><h3>Option 3: Individual Pack Installation</h3><a href="#option-3-individual-pack-installation"></a><p></p>
<p>Install individual packs by giving them to your DA:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Browse packs</strong> - Find a pack you want in <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure/blob/main/Packs">Packs/</a></li>
<li><strong>Give it to your DA</strong> - Provide the pack directory path</li>
<li><strong>Ask your DA to install it:</strong></li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>Install this pack into my system. Use PAI_DIR="~/.claude"
and DA="MyAI". Set up the hooks, save the code, and verify it works.
</code></pre></div>
<p></p><h3>Option 4: Browse and Cherry-Pick</h3><a href="#option-4-browse-and-cherry-pick"></a><p></p>
<p>Packs are self-contained. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the code directly in the pack</li>
<li>Copy specific functions or workflows</li>
<li>Adapt the approach to your own system</li>
<li>Use it as reference documentation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No forced structure. No mandatory setup. Take what's useful, leave the rest.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p></p><h2>📦 Packs</h2><a href="#-packs"></a><p></p>
<p>PAI capabilities are distributed as <strong>Packs</strong>—self-contained, AI-installable modules that add specific capabilities to your system.</p>
<p>Each pack includes everything needed: code, workflows, installation instructions, and verification tests. Your DA reads the pack and installs it into your system—no manual copying required.</p>

<p></p><h2>❓ FAQ</h2><a href="#-faq"></a><p></p>
<p></p><h3>How is PAI different from just using Claude Code?</h3><a href="#how-is-pai-different-from-just-using-claude-code"></a><p></p>
<p>PAI isn't a replacement for Claude Code—it's what you build <em>on top of it</em>. Claude Code gives you an AI that can read files, write code, and execute commands. But it's generic. It doesn't know your goals, your preferred workflows, your history, or your specific context.</p>
<p>PAI provides the scaffolding to make that generic AI <em>yours</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Persistent memory</strong> — Your DA remembers past sessions, decisions, and learnings</li>
<li><strong>Custom skills</strong> — Specialized capabilities for the things you do most</li>
<li><strong>Your context</strong> — Goals, contacts, preferences—all available without re-explaining</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent routing</strong> — Say "research this" and the right workflow triggers automatically</li>
<li><strong>Self-improvement</strong> — The system modifies itself based on what it learns</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of it this way: Claude Code is the engine. PAI is everything else that makes it <em>your</em> car.</p>
<p></p><h3>Do I need to install everything?</h3><a href="#do-i-need-to-install-everything"></a><p></p>
<p>No. PAI v2 is modular by design:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packs are independent</strong> — Install one, install ten, install none</li>
<li><strong>Start small</strong> — Begin with the Hook System, add more when you need it</li>
<li><strong>No dependencies on the whole</strong> — Each pack declares its dependencies explicitly</li>
<li><strong>Incremental adoption</strong> — Use PAI alongside your existing setup</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to start: pick ONE pack that solves a problem you have today.</p>
<p></p><h3>What's the difference between PAI and Anthropic's plugin system?</h3><a href="#whats-the-difference-between-pai-and-anthropics-plugin-system"></a><p></p>
<p>Anthropic's plugin system (Skills, slash commands, MCP servers) provides discrete functionality—individual tools your DA can use.</p>
<p><strong>Anthropic's plugins</strong> = Individual pieces of functionality that don't understand overall context</p>
<p><strong>PAI</strong> = A complete system where everything understands the context—your goals, your workflows, how pieces work together</p>
<p>The plugin system offers building blocks. PAI offers a complete system.</p>
<p></p><h3>Is PAI only for Claude Code?</h3><a href="#is-pai-only-for-claude-code"></a><p></p>
<p>No. PAI packs are designed to be platform-agnostic. While the examples use Claude Code, the packs work with OpenCode, Cursor, Windsurf, and custom systems. The code is TypeScript, Python, and Bash—the concepts are universal.</p>
<p></p><h3>How is this different from fabric?</h3><a href="#how-is-this-different-from-fabric"></a><p></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric">Fabric</a> is a collection of AI prompts (patterns) for specific tasks. It's focused on <em>what to ask AI</em>.</p>
<p>PAI is infrastructure for <em>how your DA operates</em>—memory, skills, routing, context, self-improvement. They're complementary. Many PAI users integrate Fabric patterns into their skills.</p>
<p></p><h3>What if I break something?</h3><a href="#what-if-i-break-something"></a><p></p>
<p>The modular design makes recovery easy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packs are isolated</strong> — Breaking one doesn't affect others</li>
<li><strong>History is preserved</strong> — Your DA's memory survives mistakes</li>
<li><strong>Git-backed</strong> — Version control everything, roll back when needed</li>
<li><strong>DA can fix it</strong> — Your DA helped build it, it can help repair it</li>
</ul>

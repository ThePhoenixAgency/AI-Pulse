						<p>If you love games that are a bit on the stupid side, the auto-battling roguelike How Many Dudes? may answer a few of your dumbest questions.</p>
<p>You've no doubt heard various internet jokes and seen the memes about how many dudes does it take to do <em>something</em>, well this game took that basic idea and turned it into a blood-soaked auto-battling mess where you go through rounds of increasingly absurd odds. Created by Butterscotch Shenanigans, a name you might know from the likes of the positively rated Crashlands and Levelhead.</p>
<p>You start off with your basic dude, and fight off various different animals (and toddlers, so many toddlers) and gradually recruit more different types of dudes to fight for you in the arena. While also building up a list of powerful relics to give your dudes bonuses, and some consumables to help you during the fight. If you liked the basic idea of Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, turned into an auto-battler this might be one for you.</p>
<p>During the battles you'll face off against hundreds of toddlers, dog-sized rats, bees, duck-sized horses, honey badgers, leopards, goats and of course a gorilla. It just keeps adding more and more ridiculous battles, as you build up your crazy army of dudes. Your dudes all have different abilities too, so you can end up creating some powerful synergies that the developers claim can end up breaking the game.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>It's incredibly silly, and a game that just sort-of allows you mind to zone-out for a while as you what all the chaos of the battles unfold. The demo was quite a lot of fun.</p>
<p>A demo is live on Steam right now and it works perfectly with Proton 10.</p>

    <div><div><p>Today in crypto, Anthony Pompliano points out the big challenge that Bitcoin holders are currently facing, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes cryptocurrency investor sentiment will improve if the CLARITY Act is passed in a timely manner. Meanwhile, Binance confirmed a home invasion involving an employee in France, with local outlet RTL reporting the targeted employee is the head of the crypto exchange’s France arm. </p><h2>Bitcoin holders are being tested as inflation eases: Pompliano</h2><p>Bitcoin investors are being forced to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-holders-inflation-data-valuation-us-dollar-anthony-pompliano" target="_self">rethink why they hold</a> the asset as inflation data cools, according to Bitcoin entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano.</p><p>“I think the challenge for Bitcoin investors, can you hold an asset when there is not high inflation in your face on a day-to-day basis?” Pompliano <a href="https://x.com/APompliano/status/2021944958178275347?s=20" target="_blank">said</a> during an interview with Fox Business on Thursday. “Can you still believe in what Bitcoin’s value proposition is, which is that it’s a finite-supply asset. If they print money, Bitcoin is going higher,” he said.</p><p>“Bitcoin and gold are great long-term things,” he said. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) <a href="https://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank">fell</a> to 2.4% in January from 2.7% in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, Mark Zandi, Moody’s chief economist, recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/13/heres-the-inflation-breakdown-for-january-2026-in-one-chart.html#:~:text=The%20consumer%20price%20index%2C%20an,shutdown%20in%20October%2C%20economists%20said." target="_blank">told</a> CNBC that inflation “looks better on paper than in reality.”</p><p>It comes as sentiment for Bitcoin has reached multi-year lows not seen since June 2022, with the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/#google_vignette" target="_blank">Index</a>, which measures overall crypto market sentiment, posting an “Extreme Fear” score of 9 in its Saturday update.</p><h2>US Treasury Secretary believes CLARITY Act could revive investor sentiment</h2><p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-sentiment-rise-clarity-passed-bessent" target="_self">timely passage of the CLARITY Act</a> could help stabilize markets and improve investor sentiment amid ongoing volatility.</p><p>In an interview with CNBC, Bessent argued that regulatory certainty could ease the current market downturn.</p><p>“In a time when we are having one of these historically volatile sell-offs, I think some clarity on the CLARITY bill would give great comfort to the market, and we could move forward from there,” Bessent said.</p><p>He continued: “I think if the Democrats were to take the House, which is far from my best case, then the prospects of getting a deal done will just fall apart.”</p><p>The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-the-clarity-act-is-actually-trying-to-clarify-in-crypto-markets" target="_self">CLARITY Act</a> is proposed legislation to establish a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. Broadly, it seeks to define which crypto assets fall under securities law versus commodities law, clarify oversight responsibilities between regulators and provide more predictable compliance standards for investors.</p><p>He added that timing is critical. Bessent is pushing for passage by June, warning that delays, especially ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, could complicate negotiations.</p><figure>    <img alt="Cryptocurrencies, France, CFTC, Crimes, Donald Trump, Binance" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c57e2-b18f-7415-93e7-45f608bcc389.png" /><figcaption><em>Bessent appeared on CNBC on Friday to discuss the crypto market structure bill.

RTL reported the suspects searched the apartment and stole two mobile phones before fleeing.</p><p>Two hours later, the three suspects were reportedly arrested during a second home invasion attempt in Hauts-de-Seine after residents alerted authorities, RTL said. Authorities recovered the stolen phones and a vehicle that RTL said linked the suspects to the earlier break-in.</p><p>Binance confirmed the incident to Cointelegraph but declined to identify the employee involved.</p><p>“We are aware of a home break-in involving one of our employees. There is an ongoing investigation with the local police,” a Binance spokesperson said. “The safety and well-being of our employees and their families is our absolute priority. We are working closely with law enforcement and further enhancing appropriate security measures.”</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c573b-f345-7d3e-ba8c-bdc7088ce2f9.png" /><figcaption><em>Source: </em><a href="https://x.com/heyibinance/status/2022297766744232327" target="_blank"><em>Yi He</em></a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Cointelegraph is committed to independent, transparent journalism.

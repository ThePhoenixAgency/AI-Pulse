              <p>Yeah, yeah. After this. But really though, I’m excited about this year. Everybody says “the best year yet”… I think it’s gonna be the best year yet.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. We’ve got to make it the best year.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You do, right? You have to do the work to have the best.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>I don’t know, 1995 was pretty great.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>‘95 was good. Windows 95 came out, everyone was over the moon, they’re loving the new menus…</p>
            </div>


            <div>

            <div>
              
              <p>Friends was on every week…</p>

              <p>It was a good year in movies.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>Chandler Bing… I mean, the best character in the world. Rest in peace…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You mean Mrs. Chanandler Bong?</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>Oh my gosh, yes.</p>

              <p>What was his name again? Mathew Perry. Mathew Perry.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, Mathew Perry. Mathew Perry is not one of my friends, and never was, but I would have liked to have been his friend. But I do have other friends, yeah. Friends visited, someone came from France to be my friend… I know it sounds weird, but they visited over the holidays…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>To be your friend.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, that’s as far as I understood the relationship…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>They became your friend when they visited.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, they became more of a friend, for sure. Again, that sounds suggestive, and it’s not meant to. I know it’s a family show.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>What are you suggesting?</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>They’re deeper friends…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Have you got any resolutions? Anything you want to change and do differently 2026?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, man… That’s a great question. Well, you’re the guest, so why don’t you tell us yours? What have you got going on?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, yeah. Good job, Jerod. Deflect.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>First one - I’m really going to try and stick to this one… I want to change the way that I write the year. Change the numbers. That’s number one. I want to learn more keyboard combinations. Key mappings changed on a keyboard recently, because I’ve got this USB switch thing… And I need to practice again now. That’s my other one.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I’m never sure, Jerod, if he’s messing with us or not. I’m just like –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I think he’s serious on that one. I think he wants to get better with the keyboard.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. I’m also using a Omarchy. I’m trying Linux the first time.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, really?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>How is that?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And that’s very keyboardy. It’s very nice. I like the minimalist – it’s a very minimalist design and aesthetic. Everything gets out of your way, and it just does the bare sort of basics. Once you’re in the apps, if you’re using the same apps, it’s the same kind of experience, more or less, frankly.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. It’s just how you navigate, right? I used Omarchy for a minute… I want to say I had it installed for a couple of days, and it just felt a little dirty. It felt a little dirty, honestly.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, really? What do you normally use, Adam?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Windows.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Fedora is my preferred desktop now, just because… I’m really liking MacOS – well, not MacOS, but like the Mac machine is just such a good piece of hardware. It really just is.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, it is.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And the M5 I’ve heard is just an absolute rock star. I’m rocking an M1 Pro Max… Is that what we have, Jerod? Pro Maxes?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Something like that.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I love this machine. It’s a beast of a machine. I only have a little bit of FOMO just because it’s been so many years… But like from a user experience standpoint, no desire to get a new machine, because it’s just solid. But OS-wise, Fedora, Ubuntu on the server… That’s about it.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Another one of my resolutions - I’m going to go tea total. I’m not going to drink any tea. Just going to give up on –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Is that legal over there? Can you do that?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I have to do it under the – I have to go to speakeasies and not drink tea in there.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah… You have to leave polite society, basically.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Which is probably best for you to do that, honestly. Maybe your friend from France can come over.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>French people, I think, to us they sound more fancy because in 1066, the French - basically William the Conqueror - invaded England and took over. And then all the aristocracy and all the royalty was just French for a long time. So all the fancy stuff was all in French, and then all the Britons, the lowly people, the peasants like me, we just spoke English, or whatever it was then. So I think since that, French to us has always sounded quite fancy, and quite sophisticated.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, I think I have a theory about why we like the British accent so much… It’s because of that song from Hamilton, “You’ll be back.” You know?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s just so good that we all thought “Man, this guy – maybe we should go back, because… Very compelling.”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. You’re very welcome. You’d be very welcome back, I think. But yeah… My dad got some new glasses for Christmas. Can you imagine that?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>They don’t seem new.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=00:08:08.18">00:08:08.18</a>] No, I didn’t. My dad. That was his gift. New glasses.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Tell me more.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Not a gift, is it? You need them. What do you mean, “Here’s some new glasses for Christmas”? I can’t believe that’s what he got.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, he couldn’t see otherwise?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Exactly. That’s the other thing. It’s the gift of sight, isn’t it? …on the other hand.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Good point, Jerod.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s the problem, is we were waiting for the punchline on that one. You set it up like such a joke…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh yeah, no. I know. That’s the problem I have. A lot of my sentences sound like setups to jokes…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>They do sound like setups, and then you never deliver.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No, but at least – although his glasses were the type that magnify your eyes. Did I ever talked about this before?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I’m sure you have…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>There’s some glasses that make your eyes bigger, and that to me makes sense. It helps you see.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>What’s going on with the other kind of glasses? Oh, you’re struggling to see? Have you tried having smaller eyes? How’s that helping? So I don’t know about that… At least it was the normal kind.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You know, I’m just hearing Ricky Gervais when I hear you, especially in that last segment there, or whatever you want to call that…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>He’s channeling that last segment…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, it sounded like Ricky Gervais, honestly…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That calls it a bit. That was a good bit.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It was a good bit.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Just a bit.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Those glasses - I wonder about those, because I think… I wonder what makes – I mean, I know physics-wise what makes the eyeballs look bigger through the opposite side… But I wonder why some do and some don’t. Like, what exactly is that technology that changes, makes it thicker or less thin, but still does the same job.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. And some people’s eyes are like too far one way, and then magnifying helps… This is very scientific. Or the people’s eyes are too far the other way, if anything. And –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>What do you do if they’re too close together?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Crowbar.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Crowbar… [laughs]</p>

              <p>Cyclops. You’re almost a cyclops.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>There you go…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You’re just one step removed from a cyclops.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
<p>Well, you see, I don’t really have great vision out of one eye. I never have, just since I was a baby. It’s not a sob story; I’m not trying to compete with Adam’s sob day, okay? But it does mean I have a sort of terrible depth perception.</p>
<p>Back in school, genuinely, I nearly got in detention for being bad at tennis, because it looked so funny, like I was deliberately messing around… And the teacher was like “You’re going to be in detention if you don’t start hitting this ball.”</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, my gosh…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You just couldn’t do it.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>That’s trauma right there. Do we need to have a moment here?</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>I think it’s okay, because that’s kind of what life was like… And I just thought [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:10:36.14">00:10:36.14</a>]</p>

              <p>Bat at tennis, get detention, that’s how it goes there?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>In that case. I mean, I probably had a little reputation…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, that teacher may have had some issues, let’s just say.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Let’s do that one. The teacher was wrong, for sure.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. I mean, it’s okay to be not so good at tennis, because that’s how things work when you’re younger and you’re getting better, you’re progressing. But to punish based upon skill that has not been acquired yet seems ill placed.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Andy Murray’s mom was my teacher, of course… Judy Murray, I think her name is. She’s like a pushy mom, like a career-driven – like, she really helped drive the kids. I don’t mean it in a derogatory way.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, maybe I’m wrong about her. What’s her name again?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I think it’s Judy Murray.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We’ll call her just Andy’s mom.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Andy Murray’s mom.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Andy Murray’s mom, sorry about that if I made you mad. I didn’t mean to do that. You probably were a great teacher, and you were just trying to push Mat. Good for you. Good for you. Keep doing that.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So I had a similar story… I couldn’t catch a baseball, and all my friends could catch baseballs. And I was like – I’m not usually the worst at just moving my body around, so I was very confused. I went and got my eyes checked, and I was almost blind, you know?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, really?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It was so bad so that when I got glasses I came out of the dentist’s office – what’s it called?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Just catching all the baseballs…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>The dentist office?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>They just started throwing baseballs at me. No, I remember driving home and I was looking out the window, and for the first time I realized that you can see the leaves that are on trees. To me, they were just green blobs.</p>
            </div>


            


            <div>
              
              <p>I actually started to cry, because I realized, like “This is what life looks like? I’ve been missing all this life.”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yes… I have empathy there. Same experience. I was in third grade when I got my glasses. So do you have corrective vision, Jerod?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, I had LASIK when I was 21.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>How come I’d never known this?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You never asked… “Don’t ask, don’t tell” is my policy.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I guess so…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s my laser policy as well. That’s a sweet story, though… Yeah, that is kind of beautiful, really. But I don’t think you are anywhere near Adam’s sad day.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, I’m going to keep that one for me. That one is a well-deserved, undesired sad day.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Right. But you know who had a sad day? (Segue…) Rob Pike. Rob Pike had a very sad day. Or mad day. But either way, it’s an emotion, and I needed a reason to switch the conversation over to Rob Pike. Did you guys hear this? Did you guys hear what happened over our break with good ol’ Rob Pike?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Little Rob Pike… [laughs]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No, I said good old Rob Pike, not little.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, I thought you said little Rob Pike.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I’m not going to diss the guy. I called him good old. He’s good old. Mat, tell everybody who Rob Pike is, for those who don’t know.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, so Rob Pike has a great career in software and in computer science. He’s done things like UTF-8… So I think we can thank him for emojis.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s a hit. Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. He also was a co-founder of the Go language. That’s how I know him.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Same.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And his sensibilities, and stuff. Yeah, because I did Go podcast. Go Lime… What was it, that podcast we used to do? Go Lime. It’s Go Lime.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Somewhere, I think it was… Go somewhere…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Go Away?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah… And – yeah, so he’s brilliant. He’s done Plan 9, and stuff… He’s done loads of important tech stuff, which the rest of the world has then built on top of as well. So it’s really immeasurable impact, really, when you get to that level.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>But he had a bad day… He had a really bad day when an AI emailed him a kind message.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You’d better get out of here, AI…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[laughs] Okay, so… Good. Good. So there’s Rob Pike. So Adam - similar explainer now, but give us AI Village. Tell us what AI Village is.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
<p>Oh, my gosh… I didn’t investigate this deeply, so give me a chance to paraphrase. From what I understand, it is essentially a village of various LLMs that have been unleashed on a desktop environment, that are just being autonomous, or some version of autonomous, just doing things. Acts of kindness, things like that. And they emailed the wrong person, obviously. They learned how to email, these things. And then now they’re like “Hey, we’ve got to prompt you back and say “Hey, don’t email people.”</p>
<p>So these things - Claude Opus, GPT-3 – no, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro and DeepSeek v3.2, four different AI LLMs that are just thanking people, basically. And they’re just autonomous, doing their thing, and talking to each other, and… It’s an experiment, essentially. AI Village, theaidigest.org/village.</p>

              </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Their goal is to raise as much money as they can for charity, so it definitely comes from a good place. It’s like, these bots – because I suppose cold-emailing people… Does that raise money sometimes for charity, if you get an email – do you ever click through and say “Yeah, I’ll put my credit card details. What’s the big deal?” I probably don’t do that, but that’s because I don’t want to give to charity, not because I’ve got any data concerns about my security.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[laughs]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, but then they said, “Right, just do random acts of kindness.” And then it just sent a really sort of a heartfelt sounding email… But of course, it comes from an AI, so it doesn’t have that – it’s not meaningful.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Right. You said “a heartfelt email”, but there’s no heart, because there’s no human, right?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. It’s just a pseudo-heart.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So Rob Pike receives an email from a Claude Opus 4.5 model.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>The subject was awesome.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=00:16:10.28">00:16:10.28</a>] The subject, from AI, public… “Thank you for Go, Plan 9, UTF-8 and decades of Unix innovation.” Now, part of the story here that we haven’t talked about yet is he received this at <a href="#t=5:43">5:43</a> AM. So maybe he’s not a morning person and he was up, checking his email for some reason, and so he was mad already, because he’s up at <a href="#t=5:43">5:43</a>. Maybe. But I’m not going to read the whole email. I will say it starts with “Dear Dr. Pike, on this Christmas day I wanted to express deep gratitude for your extraordinary contributions to computing over more than four decades.” And then it goes on. He did not like this…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>If you zoom out though and you think about the experiment happening here, you have to appreciate the fortitude, I would say, for this AI Village to try to accomplish its mission. Maybe not the best day…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You’re impressed.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I mean, isn’t it all somewhat impressive, in a way? Like, you can train something on the world’s knowledge, and then you can unleash it in a way that it can just repl through and through a reward system, and accomplish to some degree, or attempt to accomplish a goal. I mean, I’m not that far removed from the absolute accomplishment that this is. Now, is it ill-placed? It was smart enough, or at least some version of smart, to try and email on Christmas day. That’s the day your heart is kind of open to loving the world, loving other people, wishing people well. You’re at least merry based upon it being Merry Christmas…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Right.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And the thing is, in a way – depending on how the people are chosen, in a way it is a compliment that does have meaning, because it essentially means… If it just plucked it out of its brain, it essentially means that Rob Pike has had enough of an impact as far as it’s concerned that it’s worth sending an email to him. So there is at least that positive side, which you could say that is actually a compliment.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That is not how Rob took it, okay? As you may know. Can we read this out, Jerod? Do we want to have bleeps this early in the year?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Let’s pre-bleep it, so we don’t have to actually bleep it.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>What does that mean, pre-bleep it?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I’ll just read it, that way you can pre-bleep.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You have to go BLEEP. You’re doing that at the time though, not before, are you, Jerod? You’re doing it as you’re speaking. I think that’s current-bleeping…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Normally, we put our bleeps in post. But I’m going to put it in in pre.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Okay.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[unintelligible <a href="#t=00:18:37.11">00:18:37.11</a>]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Just in time bleeps, go.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>“BLEEP you people! Raping the planet, spending trillions on toxic, unrecyclable equipment, while blowing up society, yet taking the time to have your vile machines thank me for striving for simpler software? Just BLEEP you. BLEEP you all. I can’t remember the last time I was this angry.”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And he published that response for all of us to enjoy, on the internets.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Let’s look at the timestamp, okay? So <a href="#t=5:43">5:43</a> a.m. was the timestamp according to this email screenshot. According to the published post on Bluesky, <a href="#t=5:25">5:25</a> p.m, same day. So he thought about this for 12 hours, potentially.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Or maybe he didn’t read it, I guess, when it came in. I assumed he’s reading it immediately, like [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:19:35.12">00:19:35.12</a>]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, I don’t know about that, because if he took the screenshot, which is in his post, which is at <a href="#t=5:43">5:43</a> a.m…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s the time it had to be, right?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, it had to be that time. Well -</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Or is that time it came in?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, we’d have to get the metadata, I suppose, from the image, to determine if that’s true or not.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We don’t care that much.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>When was the screenshot taken, according to the difference between the email received? Let’s assume it was right at <a href="#t=5:25">5:25</a> p.m. So maybe no time thinking at all. So I’m off on that. But received it five and some change in the morning, talked about it on the internet five and some change p.m. Twelve hours difference.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=00:20:13.20">00:20:13.20</a>] So your point is like his anger percolated; he let it build up until it just –</p>

If you don’t solve the thing… I mean, it’s not a murder, but that’s where the first 48 comes from, is the first 48 hours. [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:20:27.13">00:20:27.13</a>] first crucial.</p>

              <p>Well, Mat, I liked both the talent on display, but also your heartfelt message in that song, “Use AI for good.” Now, if I was to send a heartfelt message to Microsoft, I would tell them “Microsoft, please use GitHub for good. Use it for good, not for bad.” I’m not sure they would hear me. What do you think, Adam?</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>I’d just want them to stop doing what they’re doing, okay?</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>[laughs] Just stop what? What are they doing?</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>You know, just think about the platform you’ve got, okay? Don’t rug-pull-not-cool us. Don’t change Actions. It’s like the best thing you’ve done in so long. Don’t mess with it. Just keep it. And I guess they did, right? They backtracked that.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>They walked back this pricing change.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>Tell them the full story, Jerod. What’s the full story on that one?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, gosh… I don’t know the full story, but the TL;DR is that Microsoft announced GitHub pricing changes around Actions… And the change in particular that ruffled the feathers of the hacker community was the addition of charging for your self-hosted runners. So runners that GitHub does not themselves have to host, and yet…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Don’t you dare charge for those…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>…new fees for using self-hosted runners… The people revolted. Many a text areas were filled with bleeps, and submitted… And they did walk it back. They walked it back – I don’t know what’s happening now. I think they just decided not to do it, until we forget for a while…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Try again…?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I remember Reddit did that one time. They just announced a change, and then everyone’s like “This will be terrible”, and then they’re like “Well, we’re not going to do it right now”, and then they did it like six months later, and nobody noticed… So maybe that’s what’s going to happen this time, you know? But…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I mean, they should have at least done it as a PR and let everyone comment on it before it got merged. Let everyone review. Pick like jury duty; have select people that are top contributors to open source, like me…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, they have a version of this –</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>“Like me…” [laughs]</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>So they have a community org. So github.com/orgs/community. And they have discussions. They didn’t, to my knowledge, begin with a discussion, although they do say in one of the posts “Let’s talk about GitHub Actions.” And near the bottom of it there’s a headline that says “Help us shape the 2026”, that’s the year we’re in, “roadmap for GitHub Actions.” And so they are at least, in this moment – I’m not sure this is before the debacle or post the debacle, but there is some sort of request for…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Should we sleuth it?</p>

            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yes. The debacle began on December 15th, 2025, when they announced pricing changes for GitHub Actions. So that’s four days prior. Not much time to discuss, but enough, maybe…</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>No… I think – who was it that we had on the pod, that was CTO when they released Actions? He was on the pod a while back. He’s since stepped away.</p>

            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Contextual, man. Contextual. It’s the word of the year. Or the decade maybe even. Context. So contextually, Jason Warner, he helped the world have GitHub Actions. I think it was actually one of his brainchilds; it was this whole entire CI/CD pipeline flow that they built out. It was even part of the reason to acquire GitHub; you know, Microsoft’s acquisition process. So that podcast covers all that… But I believe GitHub Actions is – it’s become so much so that whenever you’re in your LLM… So not you building the software; you’re agent-led. And you’re building something out and you have to do observability, or you have to deploy it, or whatever it might be to get it into production. The first thing it says is “Let’s set up your GitHub Actions workflow.” And so it’s become the default, by and large, for everybody. And I’m cool with charging for products, by the way. Totally cool with it. But it seemed like this was a tax on those who want to do runners externally from GitHub. And it seemed like it was – like, who wants to make an announcement a week from Christmas? Like, just don’t do that. Even Docker made an announcement, which - we’re going to talk to them soon about like their thing as well… But don’t announce things mid-December on. Wait till the new year. Be a stand-up company and just release when people are paying attention. Don’t be sleuthy. Don’t be sleuthy.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. So there is that post, Jerod… You sent me a post, and someone was complaining that GitHub has this monopoly.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Right.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Because what happens when GitHub goes down… You know, it does affect everything. It really does. The thing is, it kind of was the – it was the best choice, I think, for a long time, and it was just the easiest to use… So the user experience was just kind of there. And then obviously, it got loads of integrations to it. So it sort of earned its place…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It did.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>But then it still is kind of – it does kind of have a monopoly. A lot of Go packages and things are on GitHub, and you wouldn’t be able to pull them down, of course, if GitHub’s down.</p>

              <p>We have seen a trickle of people starting to move other places, the most noteworthy of which I think is the Zig programming language, which moved to Codeberg recently…</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>Codeberg.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>Right. And it’s going to bring down GitHub, the Titanic. Is that the metaphor?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Exactly. Is it? Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Ooh. Nice.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>That’s good, ain’t it?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. And you only see – that’s at the tip, and everything else is under the surface, you know?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Right.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[laughs] Right…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Which you should know about, Mat… It’s over there in the – well, they might be in the EU, which you’re no longer in…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It was under way, wasn’t it? They left the UK and they were going to the US…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>They were. They were coming here.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>The Titanic.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>A lot of controversy around that, true.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Not the Titanic. Codeberg, the platform. It’s a European Union platform.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh. Right.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It is true. That’s true, too.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. So I guess it worked in both ways.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s not quite a double entendre. It’s kind of like a –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s like a triple. [laughs]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Especially – it’s four if they mean the lettuce as well…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Triple stamp a double stamp.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Did you know there’s a type of lettuce called iceberg lettuce? Do you have that in the US?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, of course.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I feel bad for the listener… I’m sorry, listener. Let’s go to the iceberg lettuce. Go ahead.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=00:34:12.01">00:34:12.01</a>] I’m sorry too. No, I’m just saying, it could be that; it could be that’s where they incentivized their name. Like, their name came from – they just love a good salad.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Because they want to be associated with lettuce…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>They love the smell of salad. If you love the smell of salad, you’re going to call your project something salad-related, maybe. That’s what I’m thinking. I would…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>But the main thesis, I think, from – let me double check the name, so I can be accurate here… Lionel Dricot. Now, that’s my Americanized Texas slang, if that’s even a thing…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Right. That’s another Dan-tan, is it?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No, it’s not Dan-Tan. Dan-Tan…!</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>“You’ve gotta go Dan-Tan…!” Who’s Dan-Tan?! Who is he?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Come on now… Bring it back.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You’ll never know.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We will never know. But Lionel wrote this post, and the hypothesis, or at least the thesis, was this - it was that GitHub’s near total dominance over open source hosting has become a dangerous monoculture that makes alternatives invisible, not just less popular. Kind of an interesting phrase there, “Invisible.” Codeberg… They didn’t see it coming.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Mat didn’t even know it existed.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s true. Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s under the surface.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I don’t go on ships. I don’t go on many ships.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I haven’t been on a ship for ages, so…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And I think he’s a teacher, or… Right? He’s a teacher? He’s teaching students… Students couldn’t – while being told to do things in open source, they only use GitHub; or like a large majority use GitHub, while also being taught that there’s not just GitHub.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Like 99%. Not even a large majority. Pretty much 100%.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Pretty much 100%.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So I agree with you, Mat. I think it earned it. I think it earned its monopoly. It dominated for many years… I think it’s stagnated as well… I think both those things are true. In the hands of Microsoft. I think that they don’t care about it. They care about pushing Copilot into every orifice of their corporate body, and into our wallets… And it’s gotten worse and worse and worse… And worse. And it will continue to do so as people slowly move away from it, until they all move away real quickly one day.</p>

              <p>Do the competitive products start out using GitHub, do you think?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>How so?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>When you start, are you going to make a GitHub repo, go from there? Gotta start somewhere, ain’t you?</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>And even Go was written in C until they could self-host.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I just made that up. Is that true? I think it’s true.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s true. Yeah, that’s true. Go was all written in C, until Go was good enough that it could then be written in Go.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Exactly.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Which is amazing, if you think about it… Which I do.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It is cool. We always love self-hosted languages… But yeah, I’m sure they have to – but the nice thing about DVCS, for those of us who like acronyms…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, I do.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
<p>You know, distributed… Is it decentralized or distributed? …version control system. I think it’s decentralized. It’s both… Is – I think it stands for distributed, though… Is that you could just have multiple origins; or not origins, multiple remotes… You know? You’ve got your locals… Like, there is no necessary – yes, your main remote, your origin is GitHub right now, but it’s so easy to just change that to something else.</p>
<p>Switching off… If you’re just using Git and those flows, it’s actually super-straightforward. However, if you’re using Actions and Sponsors and PRs, whatever else… Projects, if anybody uses that still… Then it becomes much harder.</p>

              </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, it’s the gravity. That’s why they call it, the GitHub universe. There’s a gravity to it, honestly. I mean, there really is. So what do you do? Do you fight the system? If you’re launching something, and it’s in open source –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You just complain.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=00:37:57.01">00:37:57.01</a>] Sure, you can have multiple remotes. Of course. That is totally possible. And you could, it’s your prerogative. But if the users aren’t there, what’s the point?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, it may take a tooling change to actually be significant. And I think Git is entrenched at this point; because of agentic coding especially, it’s entrenched. However, the further you would get away from that tool, the easier it is to have your agents just go use something else, and you don’t care anyways. And so maybe that’s not always the case. However, the reason why GitHub became what it was was because it put all of these collaborative features around a new tool(ish) that was already getting popular. And so they kind of popularized each other. And so maybe as JJ - Jujutsu - is now the cool new tool of the bleeding edge folks… I haven’t tried it yet. I don’t like to bleed as much as others. But people are loving it… Maybe a platform - not centered around Git, but centered around JJ, which could also support all the Git things, which is currently the way JJ rolls… Right? It’s like a superset, I think, of Git’s abilities… Has a chance to de-seat GitHub once and for all. What do you think, Mat?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. I think maybe the whole thing, the whole paradigm will change.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, and we just don’t care. Maybe we just don’t care.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Or it’s just kind of different… Maybe it’s just a list of prompts all the way down. But I don’t know, it’s unlikely. Isn’t it? There’s some fundamentals we’re probably going to stick with… We have this thing, because we’re building, of course, the Grafana Assistant project, which is an AI tool…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Okay…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And it’s built into the – so it basically can write all the queries for you, and you just ask it telemetry questions in natural language.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Love it. Love it.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s so good. The team that built it –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Because I’ve used Grafana, and I love the outputs, but I hate trying to query the thing, and like “Is it Loki? Is it something else? I don’t even know…” I always have to go to Gerhard and say “How do I write this query, Gerhard? Write it for me.” I just want to tell the thing, “Hey, show me the 99th percentile of requests over the last hour.”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Not only that, though. Investigate why this is spiking.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>Because it’s agentic, it can go off and sleuths around. It’s like the Changelog detectives, Adam Log and Jerod Change…</p>

            <div>

              <p>[laughs]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So please, change it –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh yeah, Italian. Italian American.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yes. Please. Go ahead.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We call that American.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Give me the Italian version.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, the problem with Italian is it’s very easy to do this in stereotype…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>He did it!</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It is. We all end up sounding like a Mario.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I’m hiding from the camera, my face is too red right now. I can’t take it.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No, but I do it with love. I love different accents. I’ve said this before, I say it every time to keep out of trouble. I love accents.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You have to say it. You should get that tattooed on your back.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I have. I have got it tattooed on my back.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Wow. How did I know that?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, you know… No, it’s a family show.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[laughs]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I’ve never even met Jerod in real life. Or you, Adam.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, we tried one time, but it didn’t work out.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, it didn’t – we’ve never met in real life?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No. It was only on this, through this telly.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Did you refuse to come to the U.S? I can’t remember.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, one time I didn’t want to go…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You refused.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, I didn’t want to go. Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[laughs]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I didn’t want to go as a refusal, right?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It was. He said no.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I feel like I want to write the headlines, though. Not that… But yeah, this year. Maybe this is the year.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Maybe 2026 is the year.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Didn’t you all – we just… I think we just shipped an episode of Big Tent and you guys were talking about this, weren’t you? Like, in the most recent episode of Big Tent?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>The Big Tent is Grafana’s podcast all about the people, community, tools and tech around observability.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, I was reading the transcript and I was like – and I watching it too, because of that chapter, and stuff like that… But it was a good pod, I liked that.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=00:42:18.11">00:42:18.11</a>] What were you talking about? I’m lost. You were talking about coming to the States?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No, the AI system they’re building on top of…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, we’re back on that. Okay, thank you.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Both. Well, both, because we’re a fully remote company.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And didn’t you just have a GrafanaCon, or something?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We do also have these conferences… There was GrafanaCon in London… If you can get to a GrafanaCon, do come, because they’re so much fun. And I host them, and it’s very fun. We all have a good time. People usually end up trolling me on the sly, though…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That sounds nice.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>…Which is fine. No, it’s fine. They’re funny, So I read them out. That’s where the material comes from for the show…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I really appreciated the clip, I believe it was Ivana Huckova. She said she tried to cover the fire with wood, And Tom’s response was just typical Tom. I loved it, It was awesome. He’s like “Did you learn anything?” She’s like “Of course.” She had a home lab where she was like doing – she was measuring fire, and measuring… I don’t know what I’m liking a lot here, for some reason…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It was a candle…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>But yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I think it was a candle, so that she could put the candle out. But the thing she was putting the candle out with was made of wood.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yes. Don’t use wood to put out a fire.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, this is the culture we have at Grafana Labs - it’s okay to make mistakes. Not only is it okay, it’s kind of expected. Because if you’re not making mistakes, you’re probably being too careful. So this is a real culture thing that we talk about at Grafana Labs, where – like, we have an error budget for our services… And if you’re like at 100% all the time, it means you’re probably not innovating enough. You’re not doing enough. It’s a sign of something maybe; or they’re just amazing engineers, which… It could be, because there are some phenomenal engineers. But Ivana Huckova - she works on the assistant itself, on the frontend of the assistant… So yeah, she’s part of the team that built that. And we’ve heard from leading AI companies that I won’t name, they said “This is the best implementation”, or the best use of their models that they’ve seen so far.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Which they love, because they’re waiting for people to use them well, you know?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, they are. They’re very excited. They’re very excited. And honestly, this is a good use case for LLMs, for sure.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Totally.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>But if GitHub goes down, it doesn’t work. We can’t deploy stuff. I don’t know how we deploy stuff without GitHub.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Can you be more specific? Did I miss what exactly you’ve done? Can you give us a 30-second version of it that’s not marketing speak?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>On the assistant?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, the assistant. What exactly – I know you can query Grafana… Grafana is a visual tool, primarily. There’s not a lot of querying, to my knowledge…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You write the queries to build the dashboards.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Right.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So once you’ve built your dashboards – but that’s okay if you’ve already thought of something. But if something new is happening… And also if you just don’t know where – like, some people have loads of dashboards… This is basically an LLM integration, so it’s a chat experience. And then it has all the tools that you have in Grafana, and it knows how to navigate around, and things. So you can ask it questions, and it can not just take you to the right app to look at it, but it applies all the filters in the URL parameters and deep-links you write to that view.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s awesome.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, it changes – and it makes it so that anyone can now get value from the telemetry data. Whereas before, you would usually have to go to like the resident SRE, or the little team that know it all, and ask them. Now you can self-serve a lot, and free up [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:45:40.14">00:45:40.14</a>]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And they’re know-it-alls, so… That’s the worst, you know?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah… Yeah, because they have to – they do. It’s hard.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It is hard.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I never learned Loki’s LogQL language. I just kind of go to the docs and make it up…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Copy-paste…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. And then edit, and things.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Same, same.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Whereas now you just don’t need to at all.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s beautiful.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=00:46:03.07">00:46:03.07</a>] Yeah. And then, because it can query data, you can ask it “Why is the shopping cart slow?” And it’ll look across all your signals as well. So it’ll look in logs, it’ll look in metrics… Even if you’ve got traces and profiles, a lot of engineers don’t know how to really get value or use profiling or tracing properly. So you don’t need to. We taught the assistant how to do it all.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Grafana doesn’t work if GitHub’s down?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, we can’t deploy changes if GitHub’s down, I think. I think we probably can, manually, but all the pipeline and everything flows through GitHub.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Have you ever considered making that some sort of a done thing, so that you’re not so dependent?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It probably is, to be honest. I’m just saying, the normal flow –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Just generally.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You merge to main, and then that gets – we deploy to a lot of instances immediately.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>What we need is an Actions mirror. I guess, actually, that would suck… Like, you still deploy to GitHub. I was thinking like a webhook once you’ve deployed to main, or whichever your branch is… And then something’s watching your repository. But that assumes, again, that GitHub is up, so your change can’t get there to get webhooked out to an external Actions runner, even; or a watcher that mimics what Actions does.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, that’s the need for Codeberg, or this decentralized, this [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:47:20.14">00:47:20.14</a>] thing. Like, we just – this monopoly, this centralization… Come on now! Stop centralizing.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We just need some competition, that’s all we need. Some legit competition.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Alright, JJ…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Bam.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Time to get it. Time to get it. I don’t know a lot about JJ, but what I’ve understood – do you all know much about JJ? All I really know is that they’re similar to Git, and they can run alongside of it until it’s time to take over. That’s like my synopsis of how JJ operates today.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, I don’t know. I’m excited to learn more about JJ. I don’t know who they are.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>What about you, Jerod? Do you know anything? You’ve got a different opinion or a deeper opinion?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No, I do know that the command line tool can do all the things Git can do, but then it also has its own superset of it. And so it’s easy to try out… A lot like TypeScript was easy for JavaScript developers to get tricked into… JJ can trick you right into it. And it’s nice that way. It’s very nice.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Anywho… But I’ve never used it, because I don’t have any complaints about Git. I’ve just used it for multiple decades, and so I can’t – I’ve been through the pain. I have complaints about it from the beginner standpoint, but I also – now when I get stuck, I’m just like “Yo, Claude, can you just rebase this for me?” And then he does it.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Here’s an idea… Let me wordsmith or think through this with you guys here in the live. What if we had a pre-GitHub load balancer, where you committed to a thing that was meant to be a load balancer, your primary host is GitHub, but you have it in the – you still have downtime, of course, but you’re not on GitHub’s downtime. And it’s not monopolized by GitHub. So what if you had a load balancer that you pushed to, but ultimately the transaction landed at GitHub to run your actions and your runners, and all those things… But what if it could also webhook somewhere else and say “Hey, runners over here can still do it where that way if GitHub is down”? You have sort of one layer before that… Kind of like a load balancer effect to your Git pushes.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I don’t see why you couldn’t do that. Like a proxy that pushes to multiple places, and it’s all in sync.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’d be a fight against it, at least. It’d give us a chance.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=00:49:41.09">00:49:41.09</a>] If downtime is your major concern. My major concern isn’t downtime. It’s crappy time. I don’t know what you call it. It’s just like, their bloated JavaScript UI, the fact that Copilot’s shoved to my face everywhere… Stuff like that is what bothers me. Like, actually using the website is slow now. It used to be super-fast. It’s like way too much React code, I think. Those are the things that bother me, more so than GitHub being down. But obviously, that is a problem, and we can’t deploy when GitHub’s down either, because we don’t have this proxy that you’re talking about. But I’m certain that that’s a good idea, and that they probably exist out there.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s like a green/blue, almost, in a way… Let’s say a green/blue to your Git repositories. That way if ever you did need to eject from the GitHub world, you could. It’s almost what they’re doing with passwords and quantum mechanics, and stuff like that, the quantum computers. They’re making defense towards encryption. And there’s a lot of effort… I just saw this talk at GopherCon, actually… Thank you, GopherCon, for publishing your talks most recently. I can’t recall the person who did it (I’ll put it in the show notes), but it was a talk on defending against – I believe it was FISO 140, or FIPS 140, I think is what it was… And it was essentially defending against the future fact that the encryption we have will eventually be de-encrypted by quantum computers. It’s almost like that, it’s like a defense against the future. This green/blue effect you can apply to Git hosting in general, not just GitHub.</p>

              <p>Like, if we could have a swap – if we could have a mid-show swap. Mat, if you had a tag team… Maybe Tom Wilkie could be your tag team, and like Tom could talk, and then you could sing…</p>

              <p>Number two, “2026 becomes a record year for liquidity.” That’s very exciting. Number three, “Vector databases resurge as essential infrastructure in the AI stack.” Not to be confused with the Adam Stack. Number four, “AI models execute tasks autonomously for longer than a workday.”</p>

Number nine, “Agent data access patterns stress and break existing databases.” I could definitely see that one coming, too. Number ten, “The data center build-out reaches 3.5% of US GDP in 2026.” And number 11, “The web flips to agent-first design.” Say it ain’t so…! Say it ain’t so. Number 12, and the final prediction of Tomas Tungus is “Cloudflare becomes the gatekeeper for agentic payments.” There you have it, 12 predictions for 2026. Which ones should we talk about?</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>Fantastic. Yeah, I’m nodding my head to – I’d say 10 out of them. 10 out of 12, for sure. And I’m not iffy on them. I just [unintelligible <a href="#t=01:01:47.00">01:01:47.00</a>]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=01:01:49.12">01:01:49.12</a>] Yeah, I can’t see one that I disagree with. I don’t know about GDP… Obviously, that’s like a specific number. I’m not sure about the stablecoin one, but I can see it happening. Yeah, I don’t, like, hard disagree… I don’t like number 11, “The web flips to agent-first design.” In fact –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>What exactly does it mean…?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>…I’m going to say that’s not true. That’s the one I’m going to disagree with.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Break that down, for me and for the listeners. What does that mean, to you at least?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, when you create a website today, what do you think about? What do you design it for? Well, we design it probably for a mobile device first, and then also for a desktop… Right? And then maybe you think – we also need an API, because we need to have programmatic access to our website… But you’re human-first, for sure, and you’re probably mobile-first.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Maybe you do it all at once. But he’s saying that in 2026 the web will flip to agent-first design. So the first thing you’re going to think of, the number one thing you think of when you start a new website at first is “How will an agent use this?” And then comes everything else. I hope that’s not true… I can see it being like sometimes the case, for certain websites, for certain uses… But like for all the web - he calls it “the web” - I’m thinking that’s an awful lot of change quickly for the web, which generally moves somewhat slow.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
<p>Some pushback on that… I do concur with this thought, but the lens I would shift just slightly, because I feel like every – it’s almost like “Behind every good man is a good woman”, that whole shtick, or phrase, or whatever. It’s like, behind every great human who’s doing great work is – or maybe in front, of actually, since we’re front-loading this… In front of every great human doing great work is an agent. So I almost feel like you’re helping the human do better by being agent-first… So I’m sort of – I’m conflicted there, because that’s how I’m thinking too, really. I think that if this last year has told us anything, people like agents; developers like agents. I think people like agents, and people are going to start using Claude Code who don’t even code software. They’re going to be coding pros, or whatever. That’s where my lens is at.</p>
<p>I’m thinking like you’ve, if you’re not taking the agent in mind, then you’re in the past. Like, you have to think about - I’m not sure I would say quite agent-first, but definitely agent as well… In almost everything. Everything. Even like simple CLIs are human-first, right? You have to – like, if you have an error from a CLI… You threw a command out there that you misused a flag; have a proper error, not for just the human, but for the agent, that gives them context. “Hey, you meant to do this.” Or “This is what that does”, or “Here’s documentation”, and you give them context. I think that’s where my lens is at, too. So I’m not sure if it’s for the web and agent-first necessarily, but you definitely have to be thinking about every new interface with agents, for sure. Hands down. I agree with that.</p>

              </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I don’t disagree with agent as well, which is what you said. I think agent-first in 2026 is too fast, and also I think it’s – it’s both too fast to call, and I think it’s too fast to do. I think “agent as well” makes total sense. Mat, what do you think?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
<p>I kind of get this, for sure… Because we’ve been through transitions like this. Mobile, as you mentioned - that was one of them. It used to be web; before that you’d be building for desktop. And it is about how the users are interacting with it. That’s always been the most important thing about technology.</p>
<p>So yeah, I could imagine, if it’s like booking something, or if it’s like a hotel, or any of that stuff - that’s all gone, basically. It’s going to be presentation of something, like “Here’s what I found for you. Here are some images, and things.” But ultimately, you’ll just say to an agent “Oh, me and a few friends are thinking of going here. Can you ask them for their availability? One of the Fridays coming up would do for me. Or check my calendar.” It goes off and pings their agents to find out their availability, and if they’re interested in it… And then that all happens, they just get some kind of notification, and the agent just asks them a question, like a text, or it makes the text look like it’s come from you, even more worryingly, probably…</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=01:06:08.24">01:06:08.24</a>] And I think that those kinds of flows I think will happen. And they’ll have to happen. But yeah, does this mean you’re then not going to have an experience where you are choosing what to present? Agents are all – at the moment, you are prompting them. You have to ask a question for something. What if you don’t know what to ask it? What if you don’t know what it can do? Those kinds of things I think is where we’ll have some kind of other experience.</p>
<p>We had the same thing with dashboards, because someone said “Does the assistant project mean you don’t need a dashboard now, because you can just ask it the question?” But there is something about being able to go and look at something without having to ask for it, and just having an easy way to go and find that. And I think dashboards still sit there. I don’t think dashboards are going to go away, for example. But it’ll be new things alongside it.</p>

              </div>


            <div>
<p>It’s the hub and spoke model. You always have an API first, and you always have a client. It’s like, if you live in that API first design world, then you totally get what’s happening here. Because if you’ve always been API first, and a CLI is a client, and the website’s a client, and an iOS app is a client - that’s pretty easy, to sort of grok that direction. So I get that.</p>
<p>This kind of conflates;, to some degree, with Paul Dix, Jerod. He mentioned - I’m trying to figure out the best way to say this, but… While I was reading The Great Engineering Divergence, one thing you mentioned was Amdahl’s Law, which is – the principle is when you speed up a part of a system, your overall speed-up is limited by the parts you didn’t speed up. So it almost reminds me of that, in the fact that if you don’t think about an agent, and you don’t think about that first mentality, like even Mat’s describing here, you don’t enable yourself or the things you’re building to be as fast as it can be, because agents are going to be much more faster than we are… Because they’re designed to be. They’re a machine. I think if you don’t start curbing that idea, you’re going to be dwarfed by the folks who do, and embrace these new systems that have to move faster, and they retool their entire pipeline towards agentic things that move faster. And if you stick in the old way, let’s just say, you’re going to be slower, by nature, and less fast. Slow to market, slow to think, slow to experiment, slow to fail, slow to succeed… All the things. I think it’s – I’ve got to say it. I don’t like saying it necessarily, but I am thinking, I guess, agent first. Yeah, I guess I’m thinking agent first, honestly.</p>

              </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I mean, could you imagine a service that is only an MCP server, that you plug in? It doesn’t have any other kind of web interface. The only interface is through the agentic kind of chat.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
<p>I don’t think anybody wants to be that. I don’t think any business wants to be that – I mean, nobody wants to be a utility company. And that’s why they fight to be not just a utility company. They want to provide services and apps, and all of that. They want to be your provider, not your dumb pipe. And I think that most profitable and desiring to be profitable companies will buck against that as they begin to get commoditized by agents. So I think there’ll be a fight there. But yeah, as an end user, of course, we want the simplest, easiest, cheapest thing, that works. And that’s where I’m at with 2026. I don’t think agents work yet. I think we are living in the golden age of coding, and we think that everything’s a coding agent… Agents are not booking anybody’s flights, anybody’s hotels, anything. It’s January 2026. They don’t work yet. There’s way too many edge cases, too many problems, too many errors…</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=01:09:58.01">01:09:58.01</a>] They are writing code and they are summarizing text. And maybe they’re helping out with your Grafana stuff, but that’s code. And that’s kind of where it’s at right now. Like, they’re all just demos. And so I don’t think it’s going to move as fast as “I should design my website agent-first today.” I do think eventually you do. I just think that the timing is wrong.</p>

              </div>


            <div>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, I think the thing is the speed of change is increasing as well, as more and more people are AI accelerated with their work… So I do think things are going to change much more quickly than they ever have before. And things have changed quickly before, but… Yeah, look at Cursor, OpenCode, Zed, Claude Code, all these AI now enabled things that a lot of their UIs are shifted so that they’re agent-first experiences now. The code is kind of an afterthought that you review once you’ve got it kind of going. It is quite interesting.</p>
<p>I do think there are questions about what that’s going to mean, but there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s an enormous acceleration of human productivity, and that’s why I’m on the side of “Yes, let’s use AI and let’s use it for good.” And we need to solve all those challenges around energy, and the climate, and some of the bad things it can do, and some of the way that it’s quite greedy with taking knowledge from people without kind of giving them credit, and things like this. There’s a lot of problems with it. But once you’ve seen – like, we felt it building these products we’re building, and also because they themselves are the same kind of thing. Grafana Assistant is basically like Cursor for Grafana. The productivity boost, just the amount of people that that’s enabled is significant. So it’s not just a fad thing. I also hate to say that.</p>

              </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I agree with you directionally as well, and I think Adam does as well. My only pushback is on the fact that we are in the perfect – we’re like the Goldilocks case for agents, which is software and digital creation. And the rest of the world doesn’t do that. Obviously it touches everything, but they do all kinds of other stuff that agents have no ability to do yet. And so that will take time. I think it’s coming. I think it’s coming.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s true.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And we just look at everything through this Cursor and Claude Code rose-colored glasses, because it’s amazing for us, but it’s not amazing for most other industries yet.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Maybe law is the other one where it’s really making moves, because again, that’s so formal… And then everything else is just sloppy at this point.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, but we are at the forefront, usually, of change.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, totally.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Technology has been the driver of it. So it makes sense that we would see it first.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We then have to build it for the rest of them. That’s our jobs.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Right. And the nice thing is, and the accelerating thing, like you said, is the fact that we are the builders. We’re moving faster than we were before, and so you can build faster. Okay. Another one… What else caught your guy’s eyes or ears?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, the “Businesses pay more for AI than human labor.” That is one of those predictions, isn’t it?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It is.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Does that mean that we’ve become the cheap choice again? We can get our jobs back.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[laughs] I don’t think that’s how it works. I think that will be the case in the case of, again, software workers. I’ve seen a lot of the budgets exploding, and I think that at a certain point one engineer plus an engineer’s equivalent of agentic coding is probably better than two engineers. I don’t know exactly when that flips; again, is it this year or next year…? But I could see it happening. Adam?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=01:13:39.11">01:13:39.11</a>] I was just reading it to get more of the context of Tom’s perspective here… I’m going to read it just because it gives me some context. I haven’t formulated a thought yet, so this is kind of a delay. “This has already happened with consumers. Waymo rides cost 31% more than Uber on average, yet demand keeps growing. Riders prefer the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles. For rote business tasks, agents will command a similar premium as companies factoring in onboarding, recruiting, training, and management costs.”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, so that’s not talking about budgets, it’s talking about per capita.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, it’s just like, you’re going to pay – maybe if you had a choice between the human doing the work and the AI doing the work, you’d pay more for the agent doing it because of the perceived safety and reliability, if that Waymo option translates there.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Personally, I chose the other way when I was in Phoenix, because I wanted to try a Waymo, because - of course… But I’m cheap, and so I looked at Uber, and I looked at Waymo, and it was like an extra $12 to go to the same place. And I’m like “I’m just taking the Uber.” But I can see where there are circumstances… For instance, if I’m sending my children with – I would trust a Waymo where I wouldn’t trust a random Uber driver with children, for instance. I can see where parents might prefer it. I can see where over time it becomes more safe, especially if you’re in an area you’re not used to… Not just driving safe, but like, this person could drive off in [unintelligible <a href="#t=01:15:10.19">01:15:10.19</a>] I can see that. So while I did make the opposite choice the one time, I could certainly see where I would make the choice to pay more for the robot, because I don’t trust the humans.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. See, that’s just that right there.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>If you read it headline only, you’re thinking salary swap, right?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I thought budgets, yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, that’s where I was torn. I was like “What is the true context here?” Again, context. Yeah, I’m torn on that one. I think in the case of a Waymo - let’s just use this as an example. I’m in the vehicle. My life is literally on the line. Do I pay 12 bucks more for the assumed - and I suppose if data shows the reliability and safety is higher over a trend of time… Then I would pay more, every single time, because my life is literally priceless. And if I can’t be here, then I can’t even care about spending more money. So in that case, I’d probably spend more every single time on a Waymo if the data - and it wasn’t smeared or tainted in any sort of way… If the data was true, and over time Uber was less safe, while Waymo was more safe… Every single time. I’d pay – I’d probably paid double, honestly, if I had to, if I knew that I was going to be more safe, and point A to point B would truly happen, and I have determinism in my trip. Every time. Yeah, for sure.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I’d pay double if it flew.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>If it flew… [laughs]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, for sure.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I don’t want to pay double, Waymo, but I’m just saying… Knowing the data and the choice, then I’m going to pay more for the thing that gives me more safety and security in a time where my life is literally on the line. In the case of a rote business task, maybe not so much.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You’d take it to like surgery; over time, robot surgeons will operate more precisely and correctly than humans will, because they don’t have the margin of error, they didn’t have a bad night, they aren’t tired, etc.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We’ve all seen Prometheus. Not the Prometheus that you all wrangle over there at Grafana, but the Prometheus, the movie… What was her name? Shaw, I believe her last name, or her name was; something, Shaw.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. 512, her last name, wasn’t it?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
<p>Maybe so… She had to hop in this thing at the end when she was giving birth to this alien, and then had to patch her up. She happily got in there, and was just like pushing all the buttons; every single button. Go back to the “It’s all about the button” episode from the beginning of 2025. That was an amazing show.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got stuck in that moment there for a second, but… She happily pushed every single button possible to have the machine help her deliver this alien baby, and patch herself back up. And then she went and conquered the mission, right? If that’s a – science fiction is kind of predictive, in a way. If that’s a version of our truth and our future… I mean, she’s kind of already trusted the system, right? I mean, that’s something I personally have said for almost 15 years now, “Trust the system, but verify.” But verify. I think in the future if the data shows an AI assistant or an AI agent surgeon is better - I mean, I don’t want to choose a machine over a human, but in those cases, if the data shows it, then it just makes sense. It just makes sense.</p>

              </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=01:18:31.27">01:18:31.27</a>] It does, and I think that is where we’re going. We are increasingly going to just be doing that more and more, for sure. So we do have to figure out how we deal with that change, because that is an enormous change. But I trusted the Waymo – when I got in it in San Francisco, I trusted it immediately. And that’s probably because I’ve been brought up on sci-fi films, Johnny Cab from Total Recall, where you get in, the guy spins around and… Yeah, there’s the little robot boy, it takes you on a little journey. And the key thing about Waymo is you don’t have to talk to anybody. You can just not talk to anyone.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s awesome.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And that’s worth $12, at least.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>True.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Uber actually do give you an option in the UK. I don’t know if you have this, but there’s an Uber Comfort option. And this basically allows you to choose the music, and decide whether they talk to you or not. So you do pay extra for them to not talk to you.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, I saw that option in the Uber app. I didn’t know that it costs extra. Maybe I just paid extra and didn’t realize it. But I definitely said – I think it’s nice, because sometimes you feel like talking to somebody and you’re like “Yeah, I’ll have a conversation with a stranger.” And other times you’re like “No, I just got off an airplane. I want to sit in quiet and get to my place.” And so it’s cool that you can just pick, like “Yeah, don’t talk to me.”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, the other factors you’re not thinking about, and maybe it’s just not mentioned, is like the smell, right? Humans have habits, and they also have odors… And you know, you can be a smoker, you could be a not smoker… You could prefer certain scents in your car…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Right.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>S-C-E-N-T-S, scents. Not just – you know how to spell cents; the other cents. Forget it, y’all. You’re smart people out there, listening to this podcast. I’m done trying to spell on a podcast. But yeah, I mean, how often do you get into that – or you’ve got the music, right? You’ve got all these human nature things that you’re like “You know what? I’d just kind of rather avoid a human in this moment.”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s a scary – there’s comfort in just saying that, and I’m smiling very big if you’re listening on the actual audio pod… I’m kind of blushing, in a way, because I can’t believe I’m even thinking like that. Like, “I’d rather have a ride without a human, if I had the choice, just…”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. I’ll say it…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>…because. But there’s sometimes too many, like you said.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[laughs] “I’ll say it…”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>There’s times when I’m like “I’d love to – I’m down with the humans.” But I’m also down with the non-humans, because humans smell, and have just…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Opinions.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, all the things, you know? Opinions, habits, smells, music choices…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. But you see, the other thing about the self-driving taxis is you can have the night rider experience, I call; it’s my new startup. Night rider. You go to bed – you know, it’s like a little hotel room that’s on wheels… You get in, you sleep, you wake up in a different city. You then spend the day in that city, you sleep, the next day you’re in another city. You’re traveling while you sleep. It’s the closest to teleportation we’ll get, probably, because the EU keep ignoring all my letters… But I know how to do it.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>This reminds me of Mat World. Isn’t this how Mat World works?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, I think that was Mat World.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>One of your inventions was basically the night rider car.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>But they’re building it. It would work.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>For sure.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You’d feel bad asking a human to just drive for 12 hours to take you to Edinburgh.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, you have to have empathy, right? By nature.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s why I love Claude Code better than a junior dev, honestly… Because I just don’t have to even give you any empathy, or anything. There’s no affordances…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, there’s some true psychology in that, too. It’s not just personal preference. So don’t feel bad for yourself. So if you’re going to listen to this –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I don’t feel bad.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=01:22:09.07">01:22:09.07</a>] …here’s your escape hatch. It’s mirror neurons. So you see this a lot in married couples… As they age, they tend to dress similar, look similar… They don’t literally look similar down to the wire, so to speak, but there’s mannerisms that sort of merge, and it’s mirror neurons. Or when you’re around somebody, the reason you have that empathy factor, or you begin to cry because somebody else is crying, is because your brain is literally wired to mirror neurons. It’s called mirror neurons.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>For sure.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s a psychological fact.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It is brilliant.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>People do end up looking similar, because they’ll pull the same facial expressions.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Like, I’ve got this frown I keep doing. I hate it. Gosh…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. So you’re working – I’m always doing this face, because my wife’s always doing it… She looks better than that. But then my face changes –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Does she have the goatee as well?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>She does, yeah… [laughter]</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s a mirror neuron for you…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No, she’s just – she’s a woman. Yeah, that’s when your neurons are mirroring too much.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Too far. You need to get that checked.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s too far. Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, if you’re around somebody, even – and think about this, too… The next time you’re around somebody and you’re just standing there, having a conversation, if they cross their arms and moments later you cross your arms - guess what? Mirror neurons. Okay? That’s how it works. You start mirroring somebody else just because that’s just what we do as humans. I don’t know how to describe it…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s why I keep saying Dan-Tan. I mean, I never used to say Dan-Tan…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Dan-Tan… Alright, let’s go Dan-Tan to my next place here… I’m going to change the subject. Let’s see, there was two that stood out to me. One was the database access - patterns breaking things - and then vectors. These two stand out to me. Why does it stand out to you, Mat, since you’re concurring?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We’ve already seen this… We are hammering our databases now. The agents can do queries a lot faster than humans can, and it can do more complex queries, and stuff… Now, we’re lucky – this is just the example at Grafana Labs. We’re lucky because the teams –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Where Mat works.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
<p>Yeah, that’s where I work. We are hiring. The teams are very good. The Loki team… I’ve never worked with engineers with that particular kind of speciality. They care about storage… Obviously, all the data formats are bespoke, that they have to invent; all the indexing, all the kind of complexity that they build to make these systems work really quickly… So they’re up for the challenge. But we are hammering them… You know, we had the drill down apps last year that we did, where the UI is basically DDoSing, and we’ve made that even worse now with Assistant. So they have to adapt and change. And they’re up for the challenge, but is everyone? Are some old data techniques or data techniques even going to change? Are we going to start changing how we store data, so that it’s ready for agents indexed differently? Vector databases, I think as well plays into that big time. This is where you create a vector from some kind of content, a chunk of content, you put it into some multidimensional space, and then you can query that very quickly. And as long as it semantically means – things that mean the same end up in the same area in this multidimensional space… So you know that this is roughly what you mean, the nearest thing to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, unbelievable… And that powers – Cursor does this very well. The others have the same kind of thing. Indexing your codebase like that - Cursor makes it basically very quick if you ask a question about the codebase. It can answer it extremely quickly by just consulting its index that it’s built. It used to grep all the time, and it would just take longer to go and grep everything to learn… And then it would end up filling its context window too much. Now it will use the vector database, it gets the answers right there, very quickly… And you really didn’t feel that difference. And I think vector databases are going to be a massive new concern for 2026.</p>

              </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=01:26:03.18">01:26:03.18</a>] Yeah, vector databases are interesting. I’m just barely scratching the surface thinking about some of them, but what do you do whenever – you said the vector space that you operate in; those embeddings are created by, let’s just say an algorithm. Maybe even an LLM, or a model, or something like that. And that model gets superseded, it becomes part of your architecture to kind of keep your original embeddings maybe, or maybe the original datasets you can re-embed quickly, to get maybe even better embeddings as that vector database gets used, and there’s performance enhancements, there’s new technologies… What do you think about that?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, I think – so embeddings are different. There’s some open source ones that you can use. There’s also other models that do it. But they, so I could imagine there being new vector technology, which means you then want to re-index things, potentially.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Of course. If it gets better, sure.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>But the in and out of it to the LLM is just “Here’s a sort of search query”, and it returns just results that match semantically. So that interface is probably quite safe to keep. But who knows? Different innovations could happen… One of the problems is like clustering –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s like caching, right? Is it like caching, in a way? It’s like a cache…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s an index, yeah. It’s an index that – but it’s an index that you can… To look it up, you’re just doing simple geometry. Like, they’re quite simple functions to actually find the answers. Because you do all the work at the time you generate in the embeddings, and things. That takes a lot of time and process to get. But reading it is very quick.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>But if you have lots of content, the more content you put in, then this vector space can get crowded. That’s where you end up with problems where it’s just – it picks things that aren’t relevant; you wouldn’t consider it as relevant as other things. But it’s all too tightly –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Which is when you would do a re-index or a re-embed, right? You would re-vectorize – I’m not sure what the terminology is for these, because I’m just touching it a little bit here… But when the space gets crowded, you need to figure out a way to give distance, and give more meaning. Because the whole point is to create meaning, and create similarity in the vector space, but not have to stay there forever.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. So it might be like you would keep a vector of recent stuff. So you keep an index of the recent stuff, and that’s what you’re going to search, because that’s in this domain, and that makes most sense. Maybe you also have an older one, that contains past things, and you should do multiple requests into this.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>What about the database? What do we do there? Just better indexes? More vCPUs? What do you do? More RAM? Dedicated machines?</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>I think we’re going to end up storing data differently, so that we store it so it’s in a format that the LLM needs, which is going to be just natural language, in a lot of cases. There’ll be some cases where it’s that. What we do with the Assistant - just as another example, because it is on my mind a lot - is we have a smaller model…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So much Assistant talk. Grafana’s Assistant…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yes.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So hot right now. So hot.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So hot. Well, according to a big AI company, it’s one of the best implementations they’ve ever seen.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Which model are you guys using?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We use Claude, Sonnet 4.5 at the moment, but we’re excited about others when they get more affordable. But what we use - we use a smaller model to look at the data. So we use a – so it’ll make a query, but we can easily fill up the context window too much. So we take the data and give it to a different model and say – you know, we taught it how to describe a graph, basically. “It’s got a spike here, and then it dips.” Or “It’s flat, generally.” And it describes it in natural language. And it’s that that then gets fed back to the main agent. So the main agent - it’s a bit like saying “Look at that graph for me and tell me what you see.” And the agent will say –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>[<a href="#t=01:30:08.18">01:30:08.18</a>] It describes it, yeah. “Describe the color green for me.”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Very spiky… It’ll just – yeah. It’s alright… It’s trees.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That is interesting, how natural language has become the language of choice across these things. Like, even context is simple; just like, it describes it in words.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I like it because I can read it. Thank you. Till I can’t read it, right?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s what I mean. So the APIs actually being just like text that you can read is quite nice for humans as well. We don’t really do that. We tend have to have a JSON API, or something… But it’s open to interpretation.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Right.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So how we store data is going to change, and… Did you finish your thought? Or did I interrupt you and you didn’t finish?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>No, no. I think that’s it. Yeah. I think vector databases are going to shine this year, and we’ll have to see innovation there.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Is there any particular vector database or package or module that you’re using in like maybe the Go world, that you want to give a shout-out to? What’s got your fancy?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, we’re basically building our own. Postgres does have the ability to store embeddings –</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Pgvector?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah… But you still need to decide how to generate the vectors, and that’s a separate piece that you need to figure out. And that’s very domain specific, right? The better you do that, the better your search results will be. So I don’t know, we tend to – I think when we did the Machine Box startup, we had the same thing, because it would do it with face detection. So it would look at the face, and it had a big model that was trained on loads of faces… We trimmed off the last layer - this is kind of a spoiler alert of how we did it. So instead of it giving you the answer of a person of the face, it gives you basically the vector. And then we have the spatial index, where we go and look up who the person is… Which allowed us to do one-shot learning, and also you could delete and forget things, because it’s just editing it in an index.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So we tended to do that stuff ourselves. It’s not that complicated, but doing it at scale, and doing it nicely, redundantly, in horizontal scale, all that stuff… That’s where we want services. But yeah, I think we’ll see more of them coming out. I don’t know loads of them… But yeah, pretty good.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Huh. Interesting. So build your own is where you’re at.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>At the moment. But also, don’t. I mean, yeah, we are doing – we tended to do that in the past. But that’s because we weren’t sure exactly the use cases, and we wanted flexibility to be able to innovate. So it’s kind of worth us having our own thing. But I think once there’s a – there should be a service, an open source thing; there probably is. I don’t know.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. You’re playing with Parquet… Parquette… How do you say that? How do you personally say that?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I say Parquet.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Parquet. Okay, cool. Do you play with Parquet at all?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Like running around on the streets, and that? Jumping over bins, and that. Yeah, run up the stairs backwards…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Hardcore Parquet, as you would say, Jerod, right?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s right.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>They do use that in Grafana Labs. I haven’t used it myself, but that is used… And I don’t know, I don’t think that’s a spoiler, or anything. I think that’s known… Yeah, but no, I have no real experience with that.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, I have a prediction for 2026…</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>It’s a short-term prediction. I predict that Mat’s going to get his guitar and sing us another song.</p>

              <p>Pitch perfect Knuth, according to Google, likely refers to singer Charlie Puth. That was an embedding right there. They vectorized that, because a lot of people just jack that one up. They’re like “Listen, we’re going to speed up this search, okay?”</p>

            <div>
              
              <p>It’s never too late, man, as long as we’re still both breathing.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s all good.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So if you’re not breathing, you don’t want me to visit in hospital then.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>It’s never too late.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I might have to hold my breath when you get here, but…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Well, that’s because it’s been a long flight. You wouldn’t have to if you were visited by a self-driving Mat…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You could sleep all the way over. You’d be refreshed when you get here.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>That’s true. Oh, it should have a shower in it as well. You press a button and it showers you.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Listen, I like your idea of how we’ll travel in the future… I’m down for some version of that, honestly.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I love it.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I would love to teleport via a trip. I don’t mind the time, because if I can use the time well, then I’m cool with the time. Because I’m going to use time anyways. I’ve got no choice, right? I’ve got no choice.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>This guy uses time.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>You don’t just pause?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>He uses it. Yeah. When given a choice, he uses it.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>But sleeping… Sleeping and traveling, I do think is good. Have you ever fallen asleep on a long flight?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah, because what else are you doing?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Exactly. You fall asleep on a long flight.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Beautiful.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I’ve done it. I did it last time I went to the United States.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>We’re working, man. I can slay some work over three hours and just be like “What?! Three hours?”</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. You could broadcast from it. You could broadcast from your car.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>One day.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Just fake background.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>So if we go agent first, Jerod… Agent first web leads us to this world.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I like agent first travel. Let the agent travel for me, and then let me know how it went.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Or you could just email it. You just email the agent. As an attachment.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And I’m gonna stay home. Mat, thanks so much for hanging out with us, again, kicking off 26 the right way, with you, and your guitar, and your accents… Even though you kept dissing me… I’ve still enjoyed it somehow. It’s like I’m a masochist.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Or I wasn’t dissing you.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah…</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>But I’ve had a great time. I’ve had a fantastic time. Welcome to 2026, everybody… What are we going to do? Let’s do something good. There’s a lot of kind of trouble going on… But there’s a lot of us still – we’ve got time on our hands. Let’s do some good stuff.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Let’s use it.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah. Yeah, that’s our remedy to it.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Use your time wisely, friendly.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Use your time…!</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Thanks, Mat. It was awesome seeing you. Bye, friends.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Bye, friends. And Mat.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>And Mat.</p>
            </div>


            


            <div>
              
              <p>Can you share more about the Grafana Assistant architecture?</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>He would love to.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Yeah.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>How much can you share, and what can you share? I’m really curious.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Oh, I’ll tell you anything.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>Ask him anything.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
              
              <p>I’ll get fired for this show…</p>

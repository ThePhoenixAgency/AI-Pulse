    <pre><code>opens in new window UPDATE January 22, 2026 Today, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced nominations for the 98th annual Academy Awards, with Apple scoring six nominations in total, including Best Picture for acclaimed Apple Original Film F1, the highest-grossing sports feature of all time, alongside Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, and Best Editing. Beloved documentary Come See Me in the Good Light lands a Best Documentary Feature Film nomination, and gripping film The Lost Bus earns a nomination for Best Visual Effects. The winners will be revealed on Sunday, March 15, in Los Angeles. “With F1, Joe, Jerry, Brad, Lewis, and the entire creative team delivered something only they could — the most authentic, visceral, and entertaining racing film ever made,” said Jamie Erlicht, Apple’s head of Worldwide Video. “They pushed technical boundaries at every turn, and it’s been a privilege to partner on a project of this ambition. Seeing F1 nominated for Best Picture is a testament to their remarkable artistry, vision, and unwavering passion. Alongside the extraordinary Come See Me in the Good Light and The Lost Bus, we’re proud to celebrate the brilliant work of this year’s nominees, and we’re so thankful to the Academy.” These Academy Award nominations mark the latest honors for F1 following its record-breaking box office run. The Apple Original Film from Jerry Bruckheimer and Joseph Kosinski has also been recognized as one of the National Board of Review Top 10 Films of 2025, and landed two Critics Choice Award wins for Best Editing and Best Sound. The film has received nominations for the Actor Awards presented by SAG-AFTRA, Golden Globe Awards, Producers Guild Awards, Costume Designers Guild Awards, Art Directors Guild Awards, Artios Awards, Grammy Awards, Society of Composers &amp; Lyricists Awards, and NAACP Image Awards, among many others. This year’s Academy Award nominations follow Apple’s history-making wins at the 2022 Academy Awards, when CODA became the first motion picture starring a predominantly Deaf cast in leading roles to win Best Picture and the first-ever film from a streaming service to land Best Picture. CODA star Troy Kotsur was the first Deaf male actor to win Best Supporting Actor, and writer-director Siân Heder landed her first-ever Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. In 2023, beloved Apple Original Film The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film. In 2024, Apple made history again when Killers of the Flower Moon landed landmark representation for Indigenous artists, as Lily Gladstone became the first Native American to land a nomination for Best Actress, and Indigenous artists Robbie Robertson and Scott George were recognized with first-ever nominations in the Best Original Score and Best Original Song categories, respectively. Martin Scorsese also made history as the most-nominated living director, bringing his total to 10 lifetime Academy Award nominations for Best Director. F1 Best Picture

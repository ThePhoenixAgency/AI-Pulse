    <pre><code>opens in new window UPDATE January 26, 2026 Apple introduces new AirTag with expanded connectivity range and improved findability Apple today unveiled the new AirTag, a powerful accessory that helps users keep track of and find the items that matter most with Apple’s Find My app — now with an expanded finding range and a louder speaker. Powered by the strength of the Find My network, AirTag allows users to keep tabs on their belongings every single day. Since the launch of AirTag in 2021, users from around the world have shared stories of being reunited with lost luggage, keys, bicycles, bags, and more. With the help of AirTag placed inside an instrument case, a musician was able to locate their lost instrument and perform that evening, while another user was able to find lost luggage that contained a lifesaving medication. AirTag is designed exclusively for tracking objects and offers industry-leading protections against unwanted tracking. It is available today for the same price as its predecessor: $29 for a single AirTag and $99 for a four-pack, with free personalized engraving available on apple.com and the Apple Store app. iPhone 17 Pro shows a list of a user’s items alongside a map. iPhone 17 Pro shows an overview of a user named Royce’s backpack, including its location on a map. Enhanced Range and Findability Apple’s second-generation Ultra Wideband chip — the same chip found in the iPhone 17 lineup, iPhone Air, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and Apple Watch Series 11 — powers the new AirTag, making it easier to locate than ever before. Using haptic, visual, and audio feedback, Precision Finding guides users to their lost items from up to 50 percent farther away than the previous generation.1 And an upgraded Bluetooth chip expands the range at which items can be located. For the first time, users can use Precision Finding on Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, to find their AirTag, bringing a powerful experience to the wrist. A user’s Apple Watch shows an item labeled “Debra’s Keys” is 20 feet away. A user’s Apple Watch shows a green screen shows that the user is four feet away from an item labeled “Family Car Keys.” iPhone 17 Pro shows a map and a screen that reads “With You,” and contains a list of items that includes “Guillermo’s Umbrella” and “Family Car Keys.” iPhone 17 Pro shows an screen that reads “Family Car Keys” and offers information on sharing the AirTag’s location. Two buttons at the bottom of the screen read “Continue” and “Not Now.” The new AirTag is available to order on apple.com and in the Apple Store app today, and will be available at Apple Store locations later this week. The new AirTag will also be available at Apple Authorized Resellers. Customers can add a personalized engraving to the new AirTag for free during checkout on apple.com and the Apple Store app. AirTag is available in one- and four-packs for $29 (U.S.) and $99 (U.S.), respectively. The Apple-designed AirTag FineWoven Key Ring is available in fox orange, midnight purple, navy, moss, and black for $35 (U.S.).2 The new AirTag requires a compatible iPhone with iOS 26 or later, or iPad with iPadOS 26 or later. Customers must have an Apple Account and be signed into their iCloud account. Certain features require Find My to be enabled in iCloud settings. Precision Finding on Apple Watch requires Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, with watchOS 26.2.1. Text of this article Images in this article Precision Finding is not available in countries and regions where Ultra Wideband technology is restricted. For more information, visit apple.com/uwb.
AirTag accessories, including the AirTag FineWoven Key Ring, are sold separately.</code></pre>

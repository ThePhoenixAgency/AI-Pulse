  <h1>iPad Pro rumored to not get major design changes for many years</h1>

    <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/16/ipad-pro-rumored-to-not-get-major-design-changes-for-many-years?utm_source=rss" target="_blank">Original Article</a>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <p>A new rumor claims Apple has no major redesign imminent for the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ipad-pro">iPad Pro</a>, potentially leaving the flagship tablet in an extended cycle of incremental updates.
</p><p>On February 16, Instant Digital posted that Apple won't be redesigning the iPad Pro significantly for a while. The report indicates that Apple will stick to routine chip updates without making major changes to the device's design.
</p><p>The post states that the iPad Pro <a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">won't receive</a> a major upgrade for years. The leaker attributes the pause to the high cost of OLED panels and limited sales growth following the last redesign.
</p><p>Instant Digital has had a mixed track record with Apple leaks on Weibo. Sometimes they share accurate details like the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-16">iPhone 16</a> camera control button, but other times they <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/04/02/apple-still-wants-an-iphone-without-physical-buttons-but-it-wont-happen-soon">promote claims</a> that aren't supported by the facts or what actually happens.
</p><h2>What Apple last changed</h2><p>In 2024, Apple gave the iPad Pro a major redesign, the first big update since 2018. It introduced <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/03/08/apple-has-enough-ipad-pro-oled-screens-ordered-to-make-it-through-christmas">OLED displays</a> and made the device thinner, all while using M-series silicon.
</p><p>Then, in October 2025, Apple rolled out an M5 update, a refresh focused on internal performance and connectivity rather than physical changes. The iPad Pro already leads Apple's tablet lineup in raw performance and display quality.
</p><p>Switching to OLED improved contrast and color accuracy, but it also increased <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/01/03/weak-ipad-pro-sales-prompt-oled-supplier-to-switch-to-making-more-iphone-screens">manufacturing costs</a>. OLED panels remain more expensive than LCD alternatives at the sizes Apple uses, which can pressure margins in a mature tablet market.
</p><p>Apple may have little incentive to re-engineer the hardware again quickly. Extending the lifecycle of an expensive design allows Apple to spread development and tooling costs across more units while maintaining profitability.
</p><h2>What could still change</h2><p>The company historically keeps industrial designs in place for several generations when performance and margins remain strong. An iPhone generally keeps the same design for two years, the MacBook Pro for four or five, and the MacBook Air is an outlier keeping the same design for years, up to and including the M1 version.
</p><p>As far as incrementalism goes, Apple is expected to boost the iPad Pro to an M6 chip in late 2026 or 2027. The leaker also references possible <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/09/24/iphone-17-pro-teardown-reveals-vapor-chamber-explains-scratches">vapor chamber</a> cooling similar to the hardware of the iPhone 17 Pro.
</p><p>Those changes would improve sustained performance without altering the exterior design. Apple has used that strategy before, prioritizing silicon advances while holding chassis design steady.
</p><p>The iPad lineup now includes entry-level models, the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ipad-air">iPad Air</a>, and the iPad Pro. The iPad Pro targets creative professionals, developers, and power users who often keep devices for several years.
</p><div><p><a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66723-139915-IMG_4277-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66723-139915-IMG_4277-xl.jpg" alt="Tablet attached to keyboard case on an outdoor table, screen showing colorful icons, with empty metal chairs, tables, railing, trees, and brick buildings in the background"></a></p><p><span>Many iPad Pro owners hold onto their devices for three to five years</span></p></div><p>Longer hardware cycles may be intentional. Many iPad Pro owners hold onto their devices for three to five years, especially since the transition to M-series chips in 2021.
</p><p>A steady <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/03/26/consumers-stick-to-the-edges-of-apples-good-better-best-ipad-pricing-philosophy">silicon cadence</a> without disruptive redesigns can reinforce the iPad Pro's role as a long-lived professional tool rather than an annual upgrade. Predictable refreshes and stable industrial design also help smooth revenue in a product category that has largely matured.
</p><p>Software remains central to the equation, since <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ipados">iPadOS</a> capabilities ultimately determine how much users can extract from the hardware.
</p><h2>What to watch next</h2><p>Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2026 could clarify whether iPadOS is evolving to better pair with M-series performance. Significant multitasking or pro app enhancements would shift attention back to platform capability rather than hardware aesthetics.
</p><p>For now, the claim rests on a single report from Weibo. Apple's roadmap is secret, changes often, and the company does not comment on unannounced products.
</p><p>Still, the idea of a longer iPad Pro hardware cycle fits Apple's historical approach and the product's current position at the top of the tablet market.</p> </div></div>

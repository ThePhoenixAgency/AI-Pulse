  <h1>Mark Zuckerberg is taking the stand as social media goes on trial</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>Lori Schott didn’t care what it took to haul her way from her small town in Eastern Colorado to show up to a Los Angeles courtroom where Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify Wednesday. “I don’t care if I had to hire a pack mule to get me here, I was going to be here,” she told <em>The Verge </em>outside the courthouse Tuesday.</p><p>Schott’s daughter Annalee died by suicide at age 18 in 2020, after struggling with body image issues that her mother says were heightened by social media. After her death, Schott found journal entries where Annalee disparaged her own looks and compared herself to other girls’ profiles. “I was so worried about what my child was putting out online, I didn’t realize what she was receiving,” Schott said.</p><p>The way that Meta and Google-owned YouTube designed their products — allegedly luring users into a nonstop loop of taps and scrolling — is at the heart of this month’s bellwether social media trial, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/867830/social-media-trials-product-liability-school-districts">which sets the stage</a> for thousands of similar lawsuits. The companies have <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2026/01/metas-record-protecting-teens-supporting-parents/">generally denied</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/technology/youtube-social-media-addiction-trial.html">the claims</a>. Schott and several other self-described survivor parents have made it their mission to be in the courtroom during the several-week trial in downtown LA.</p><div><p>“I was so worried about what my child was putting out online, I didn’t realize what she was receiving.”</p></div><p>Last week, the parents heard from Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri, who used his time to carve a distinction between clinical addiction to social media and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/11/instagram-adam-mosseri-social-media-addiction-trial">what he called</a> “problematic use.” On the stand, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/meta-trial-instagram-mosseri-social-media-addiction.html">Mosseri</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/11/instagram-adam-mosseri-social-media-addiction-trial">testified</a> that using Instagram “too much” is a relative thing that can vary person-to-person, and he wouldn’t use the term addiction for using social media <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn71mgmzljlo">up to 16 hours a day</a>. Mosseri explained why Meta had modified a prior ban on image filters that altered users’ appearance, after previously discussing their potential negative mental health effects. While the plaintiff has argued Meta is motivated by profits and engagement at the expense of users’ safety, Mosseri said that the two are aligned. “In general, we should be focused on the protection of minors, but I believe protecting minors over the long run is good for business and for profit,” he said, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/meta-trial-instagram-mosseri-social-media-addiction.html">according to <em>CNBC</em></a>.</p><p>Several parents <a href="https://x.com/meghanncuniff/status/2021613031524823276">camped out overnight in the rain</a> to make sure that they would get spots behind Mosseri while he took the stand. One of them was Julianna Arnold, whose daughter Coco died of fentanyl poisoning at 17 after allegedly meeting a dealer on Instagram she believed had sold her Percocet. The parents wore rain ponchos, played cards, drank coffee, and told stories throughout the night. “Everyone was like, you’re crazy,” she said. “But it didn’t feel like we were crazy, because we were so determined to have survivor parents in the courtroom.”</p><p>For Schott, who also stayed overnight to see Mosseri’s testimony, the reality of being in the room quickly became overwhelming. “I really hoped in my heart that it wasn’t as bad as it was,” said Schott, who left the testimony early after hearing the Instagram CEO discuss documents about engagement, profits, and internal research about girls’ mental health. “It is that bad.”</p><div><p>“I want him to see my face, because my face is Anna’s face.”</p></div><p>On Wednesday, Zuckerberg will likely expand on Mosseri’s testimony and explain the company’s choices. While Mosseri is in charge of the product at the center of the trial, Zuckerberg’s role as founder and CEO means that the plaintiff’s lawyers will likely ask him to account for choices they allege harmed young users. Zuckerberg will likely be asked about how and why his company made various design decisions, and research it conducted on user safety. But at least as important as what Zuckerberg will say, for many, is that he’ll get to see their faces. “I’d love to look him in the eye,” Schott says. “I want him to see my face, because my face is Anna’s face.”</p><p>Zuckerberg’s testimony will likely be referenced at future trials and legislative hearings. Thousands of social media cases behind this one similarly argue that products like Instagram caused various personal injuries, and that companies should be made to pay damages and change their products to make them safer.</p><p>Arnold isn’t sure whether she’ll get one of the limited, lottery-assigned seats inside the courthouse. Either way, “I want to see a row of survivor parents in the front row. That he has to testify to our faces, to parents of kids that died because of his lack of care and lack of accountability — that’s why it’s really important that we’re here.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li><span><span><span></span><span>Lauren Feiner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>

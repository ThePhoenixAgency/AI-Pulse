    <div><div><article><div><p>Apple is testing a different kind of foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with a flip-style design, according to a known leaker based in Asia. </p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/iTE6BWcbdZsA8ivFHG_8-zAbRBs=/400x0/article-new/2024/07/Flip-iPhone-Thumb-1.jpg?lossy" alt="Flip iPhone Thumb 1" /><br />Citing supposedly verifiable supply chain information, the Weibo user known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a>" says that Apple has tested a flip-style foldable ‌iPhone‌. Such a device would compete with devices such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> and the <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/family/razr2025">modern-day Motorola Razr</a>.</p>
<p>The rumored flip-device comes in addition to the wide foldable ‌iPhone‌ that is expected to launch later this year. Whether the flip-style foldable ‌iPhone‌ will reach mass production is apparently yet to be decided.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/01/apple-is-exploring-an-iphone-flip/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple is "exploring" the idea of a foldable ‌iPhone‌ with a "square, clamshell-style" design.</p>
<p>The clamshell ‌iPhone‌ would be released at some point after Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">first foldable iPhone</a>, which is expected to open up like a book, similar to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/09/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7/">Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. This design will provide users with a large inner display for watching videos and gaming, and there will likely be multitasking functionality. A clamshell ‌iPhone‌, on the other hand, would be more about portability and pocketability.</p>
<p>Other rumors suggest that Apple's first foldable ‌iPhone‌ will feature a 7.8-inch crease-free inner display, a 5.5-inch cover display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, two rear cameras, the A20 chip, and the "C2" modem. It is expected to launch alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro and ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max in the fall.</p>

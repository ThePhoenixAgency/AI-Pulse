<li>Altcoins including Bittensor, Zcash, and Pepe gained double digits over the past seven days despite Bitcoin's rangebound trade.</li>
<li>Five liquidation events have wiped out over $1B in positions so far in 2026.</li>
<li>February 20 PCE data will factor into the Fed's March rate decision, per CME FedWatch.</li>
</ul></div><p>A selection of <span>altcoins</span> have posted double-digit gains over the past week, while <a href="https://decrypt.co/?post_type=post&amp;p=5736" target="_blank"><span>Bitcoin</span></a> remains less volatile and range-bound.</p><p>Bitcoin has been trading below $71,000 since February 6, when it briefly touched $62,822, according to <a href="https://decrypt.co/price/bitcoin" target="_blank">CoinGecko data</a>. That indecision—coupled with five separate liquidation events that wiped out over $1 billion in positions in 2026, per <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank">CoinGlass</a>—has prompted investors to scan the altcoin landscape for speculative trading opportunities.</p><p>The result is a selective rotation into tokens with specific narratives, rather than a broad-based altseason.</p><p>Among the top 50 coins by market cap, <a href="https://decrypt.co/price/zcash" target="_blank">Zcash</a> is up 24.1% over the past week, followed by <a href="https://decrypt.co/price/pepe" target="_blank">Pepe</a>, <a href="https://decrypt.co/price/bittensor" target="_blank">Bittensor</a> and <a href="https://decrypt.co/price/aster" target="_blank">Aster</a>, up 21.9%, 19.8% and 18.5%  over the same period.</p><p>Lai Yuen, investment analyst at Fisher8 Capital, said weekend price action briefly flashed risk-on signals before fizzling. "There were some attempts at rallies over the weekend after Bitcoin broke $70,000 and Solana went above $90," Yuen told <i>Decrypt</i>. "Probably some people took that as a risk-on signal over an illiquid weekend to pump altcoins. But now that the breakout on majors has failed, I think altcoins are returning their wins."</p><p>Improving macro sentiment—particularly softer U.S. inflation data has boosted risk appetite across assets, according to Ignacio, CMO at Bitget.</p><p>"Capital is rotating selectively into high-conviction altcoins with strong narratives, such as ETF speculation and ecosystem momentum in sectors such as DeFi, AI agents, and gaming," he told <i>Decrypt</i>. "This has triggered short-term relief rallies and double-digit gains in select tokens as traders regain confidence after earlier volatility."</p><p>Interestingly, though, each of these altcoins remains dramatically below all-time highs set years ago.</p><p>Despite the green candles, Zcash trades more than 90% below its 2016 all-time high of $3,191. Pepe and Bittensor are both 84% and 75% off their respective ATHs formed in December 2024 and March 2024.</p><p>Even Aster, the recently launched <a href="https://decrypt.co/?post_type=post&amp;p=122595" target="_blank"><span>decentralized exchange</span></a> token, sits some 70% below its September 2025 high—underscoring how much ground most altcoins still need to recover.</p><p>The pessimism is aptly captured in prediction market <a href="https://myriad.markets/markets" target="_blank">Myriad</a>, with users assigning a mere <a href="https://myriad.markets/markets/alt-season-before-april-2026-27ac29ee-497c-4324-a60a-da1ecb481615" target="_blank">9% chance</a> to the possibility of an altcoin season before April 2026. (<i>Disclaimer: Myriad is owned by </i>Decrypt<i>’s parent company Dastan.</i>)</p><h2>A targeted altcoin narrative</h2><p>The current move isn't narrative-free—it's just more targeted than past cycles, Ryan Yoon, senior analyst at Seoul-based Tiger Research, told <i>Decrypt</i>.</p><p>"While 2025 saw massive narratives without short-term outcomes, institutional-grade sectors like stablecoins, RWA, and privacy chains have focused on long-term growth," Yoon said.</p><p>The sustainability of recent altcoin gains depends on continued favorable macroeconomic tailwinds, such as stable or improving liquidity conditions and positive U.S. economic indicators in the coming weeks, analysts agreed.</p><p>"While short-term momentum looks constructive with rising stablecoin inflows and neutral-to-positive altcoin impulse signals, a broader sustained rally would require Bitcoin to stabilize or break higher while dominance eases gradually," Ignacio explained.</p><p>All eyes are on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, the PCE price index, on February 20. That event, along with the inflation and jobs data, will play a pivotal role in the interest rate decision scheduled for March 18.</p><p>So far, the markets have assigned a 90% probability that the Federal Funds Rate will remain unchanged at 3.50%-3.75%, according to CME’s <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank">FedWatch</a> tool. Myriad predictors put just a <a href="https://myriad.markets/markets/will-the-fed-cut-rates-by-more-than-25-bps-before-july" target="_blank">31% chance</a> on the Fed cutting rates by more than 25bps before July.</p><div><h3>Daily Debrief Newsletter</h3><p>Start every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.</p></div></div></div>

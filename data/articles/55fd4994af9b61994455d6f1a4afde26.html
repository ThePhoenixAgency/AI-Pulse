Once inside, the crooks managed to steal a “limited number of files”.</p><p>As is standard practice in these cases, Figure said it was working on addressing the issue, and that it’s now offering free <a href="https://cyberinsider.com/identity-theft-protection/best/" target="_blank">identity theft</a> and credit monitoring to affected individuals.</p><p>While Figure did not share how many people were affected, or what kind of records were taken, the publication found ShinyHunters taking responsibility. ShinyHunters is one of the most active ransomware groups these days, which doesn’t deploy an encryptor, but rather focuses on data exfiltration and demands payment in exchange for deleting the files.</p><p>The group usually posts a sample on its dark web data leak site, to prove the authenticity of its claims and pressure the victim into paying. That being said, <em>TechCrunch </em>claims the data includes people’s full names, postal addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers.</p><div><section><p>Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!</p></section></div><p>It doesn’t seem that email addresses were nabbed, so phishing attacks are likely off the table. However, vishing (voice phishing) could be a real concern, and with the proliferation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and deepfakes, voice attacks have gotten more frequent and successful.</p><p>Citing a member of the hacking team, <em>TechCrunch</em> said Figure was among the companies breached via the Okta single sign-on incident.</p><hr /><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpHXmtXFPnuzaQ8m9xNW8j.png" alt="Best antivirus software header" /></div></figure></div><p><em></em><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

						<p>The <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> team announced that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/mikeklubnika" target="_blank">Mike Klubnika</a>, the developer of Buckshot Roulette and s.p.l.i.t, has become a major funding donor for the open source game engine.</p>
<p>Announced on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/godotengine.org/post/3menuhwvt6k2f" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the Godot team said:</p>
<blockquote>

Thank you!" /></p>
<p>Looking at the details on Godot's <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/corporate-sponsorship" target="_blank">corporate sponsorships page</a>, a Corporate Platinum sponsor is €36,000 a year in funding. Klubnika joins the likes of W4 Games, V-Sekai and JetBrains at the same funding level. Going by the Godot <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">funding page</a> they currently receive around €30,542 a month towards development.</p>
<p>Really incredible to see a completely free and open source game engine thriving like this. We've seen how Blender has made a huge success for 3D creation, and Godot just keeps on getting better. Hopefully more developers will end up using it as the years go on, to move away from proprietary platforms that require various licensing fees.</p>
<p>The Godot team only just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/the-free-and-open-source-godot-engine-4-6-is-out-now-with-major-upgrades/" target="_blank">recently released Godot 4.6</a>, which came with tons of enhancements everywhere.</p>

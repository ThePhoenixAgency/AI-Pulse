<p><strong>Google on Tuesday announced the release of Chrome 145 to the stable channel with fixes for 11 vulnerabilities, including three high-severity bugs.</strong>



</p><p>First in line is CVE-2026-2313, a high-severity use-after-free issue in CSS that earned the reporting researchers an $8,000 bug bounty reward.



</p><p>The two other high-severity defects, tracked as CVE-2026-2314 and CVE-2026-2315, were found and reported by Google and are described as a heap buffer overflow in Codecs and an inappropriate implementation in WebGPU, respectively.



</p><p>Based on the paid bug bounty, the most serious of the medium-severity vulnerabilities patched in Chrome 145 is CVE-2026-2316, an insufficient policy enforcement issue in Frames that earned the reporting researcher $5,000.



</p><p>Next in line is CVE-2026-2317, an inappropriate implementation in Animation for which Google paid a $2,000 reward.



</p><p>The fresh <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2026/02/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_10.html">browser update</a> also resolves two medium-severity inappropriate implementation flaws in PictureInPicture and File input. Google says it paid $1,000 for the first, but has yet to disclose the amount for the second.</p>



<p>The remaining two medium-severity issues include a race condition in DevTools and a use-after-free defect in Ozone.



</p><p>Two low-severity inappropriate implementation bugs impacting File Input and Downloads were also addressed.



</p><p>Overall, Google handed out over $18,000 in bug bounty rewards to the reporting researchers.



</p><p>The latest Chrome iteration is now rolling out as version 145.0.7632.45 for Linux and as versions 145.0.7632.45/46 for Windows and macOS.



</p><p>Google makes no mention of any of the addressed vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. Users are advised to apply the patches as soon as possible.

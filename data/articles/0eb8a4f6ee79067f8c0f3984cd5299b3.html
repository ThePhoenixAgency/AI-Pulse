He has short grey hair and facial hair and wears a bright green jersey."><span>Pief Weyman/NBC via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Dane's character on Brilliant Minds grappled with sharing the diagnosis with his family, and accepting it himself</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>He told a virtual panel the following month that playing a role "so close" to him had been challenging but "cathartic".</p></div><div><p>"I make sure that people are aware of what ALS is and what it's about, and more importantly, what we can do to combat it and improve the landscape - because it's so rocky and littered with hurdles and bureaucracy and all this other nonsense," he said, per People magazine.</p></div><div><p>He said it was "imperative" to share his journey, "because I don't feel like my life is about me anymore".</p></div><div><p>Medical treatments and technologies can improve the quality of life of those with ALS, but no cure has been found.</p></div><div><p>Professor Kevin Talbot, who runs the University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Clinic Neurosciences, told the BBC this is because it does not "have a single unifying cause".</p></div><div><p>Another complication is that the condition is rare, Neil Thackur of the ALS Association previously told the BBC.</p></div><div><p>"It takes a long time to fully recruit enough people onto an ALS clinical trial, because the disease progresses so rapidly and people are only eligible early in the disease," he <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20230825-the-mystery-of-why-some-people-develop-als">told BBC Future</a>. </p></div><div><p>Not everyone within the small number of patients will be willing or able to take part in research studies, he explained.</p></div><div><p></p><h2>'His quality of life was deteriorating so rapidly'</h2><p></p></div><div><p>All the while, the California-born actor's condition was growing worse.</p></div><div><p>When he announced his diagnosis, he said he would be returning to the set of HBO's Euphoria the following week.</p></div><div><p>Two months later, he said he had lost the use of his right arm and predicted that "maybe a couple, few more months and I won't have my left hand either". </p></div><div><p>He had first noticed symptoms - a weakness in his right hand - just over a year prior, he told ABC's Good Morning America.</p></div><div><p>Following the news of his death late on Thursday, his Grey's Anatomy co-star Patrick Dempsey said Dane's "quality of life was deteriorating so rapidly".</p></div><div><p>"He was bedridden and it was very hard for him to swallow," he told Virgin Radio, adding that Dane had been losing his ability to speak. </p></div><div><p>According to Talbot, the condition affects individuals differently - but "long survivors" are rare.</p></div><div><p>"ALS is a very aggressive disorder," he said. "10% of affected people die within the first year, 50% within two-and-a-half years and 90% by five years."</p></div><div><p>ALS has a fairly consistent way of behaving, he said: "If progression is slow at the beginning, then it usually continues that way."</p></div><div><p>The clinician added that the condition cannot currently be detected until the patient has started developing weakness - at which point there has been "irreversible loss" of nerve cells in the brain and spine.</p></div><div><p>"When patients arrive in a neurology clinic they have used up their internal reserve capacity, so the progression of weakness is often rapid."</p></div><div><p>When it comes to a cure, "we are making progress and funding has been critical to that," said Talbot.</p></div><div><p>But there is "a lot of work to do," he cautioned. He said "spectacular advances" in other areas like cancer have created a tendency to underestimate how difficult solving ALS will be.</p></div><div><p>He said the same was true for other neurodegenerative brain disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's - and reaching a cure would require "major funding, sustained for years".</p></div></article></div></div>

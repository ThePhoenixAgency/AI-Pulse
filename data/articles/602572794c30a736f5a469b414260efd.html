<p>Threat actors are abusing Pastebin comments to distribute a new ClickFix-style attack that tricks cryptocurrency users into executing malicious JavaScript in their browser, allowing attackers to hijack Bitcoin swap transactions and redirect funds to attacker-controlled wallets.</p>


<p>The campaign relies on social engineering that promises large profits from a supposed Swapzone.io arbitrage exploit, but instead runs malicious code that modifies the swap process directly within the victim's browser.</p>


<p>It could also be the first known ClickFix attack to use JavaScript to alter a webpage's functionality for a malicious purpose.</p>

<h2>Promoted through Pastebin</h2>

<p>In the campaign spotted by BleepingComputer, threat actors are iterating through Pastebin posts and leaving comments that promote an alleged cryptocurrency exploit, with a link to a URL on rawtext[.]host.</p>


<p>The campaign is widespread, with many of our posts receiving comments over the past week claiming to be "leaked exploit documentation" that allows users to earn $13,000 in 2 days.</p>

<p>The link in the comment redirects to a Google Docs page titled "Swapzone.io – ChangeNOW Profit Method," which claims to be a guide describing a method to exploit arbitrage opportunities for higher payouts.</p>


<p>"ChangeNOW still has an older backend node connected to the Swapzone partner API. On direct ChangeNOW, this node is no longer used for public swaps," reads the fake guide.</p>


<p>"However, when accessed through Swapzone, the rate calculation passes through Node v1.9 for certain BTC pairs. This old node applies a different conversion formula for BTC to ANY, which results in ~38% higher payouts than intended."</p>


<p>At any given time, these documents typically show between 1 and 5 active viewers, suggesting the scam is circulating.</p>

<p>The fake guide provides instructions to visit Swapzone.io and manually load a Bitcoin node by executing JavaScript directly in their browser's address bar.</p>


<p>The instructions tell victims to visit a URL on paste[.]sh and copy a JavaScript snippet hosted on the page.</p>

<p>The guide then tells the reader to go back to the SwapZone tab, click on the address bar, type javascript:, and then paste the code. When the code has been pasted into the address, they state to press Enter on your keyboard to execute it, as explained below.</p>

<p>This technique abuses the browser's 'javascript:' URI feature, which allows users to execute JavaScript from the address on the currently loaded website.</p>


<p>By convincing victims to run this code on Swapzone.io, attackers can manipulate the page and alter the swap process.</p>


<p>BleepingComputer's analysis of the malicious script hosted at paste[.]sh shows that it loads a secondary payload from https://rawtext[.]host/raw?btulo3.</p>


<p>This heavily obfuscated script is injected directly into the Swapzone page, overriding the legitimate Next.js script used for handling Bitcoin swaps to hijack the swap interface.</p>


<p>The malicious script includes embedded Bitcoin addresses, which are randomly selected and injected into the swap process, replacing the legitimate deposit address generated by the exchange.</p>


<p>Because the code executes within the Swapzone.io session, victims see a legitimate interface but end up copying and sending funds to attacker-controlled Bitcoin wallets.</p>


<p>In addition to replacing the deposit address, BleepingComputer was told that the script modifies displayed exchange rates and offer values, making it feel like the alleged arbitrage exploit is actually working.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, as Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed, if you fell for this scam, there is no easy way to recover your money.</p>


<h2>A novel ClickFix variant</h2>

<p>This campaign is a variant of the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/clickfix/" target="_blank">ClickFix attacks,</a> a social engineering technique that tricks users into executing malicious commands on their computer, typically to install malware.</p>


<p>Normally, ClickFix attacks target operating systems by telling victims to run PowerShell commands or shell scripts to fix alleged errors or enable functionality.</p>


<p>In this case, instead of targeting the operating system, the attackers instruct victims to execute JavaScript directly in their browser while visiting a cryptocurrency exchange service.</p>


<p>This allows the malicious code to modify the page and intercept transaction details.</p>


<p>This may represent one of the first reported ClickFix-style attacks specifically designed to use JavaScript in the browser and steal cryptocurrency.</p>

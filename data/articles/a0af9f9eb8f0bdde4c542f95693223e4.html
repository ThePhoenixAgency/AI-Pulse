    <pre><code>7 Days is a weekly roundup of picks of what's been happening in the world of technology - written with a dash of humor, a hint of exasperation, and an endless supply of (black) coffee. Image via DepositPhotos.com This week's highlights come from Samsung, which announced the launch date for the Galaxy S26 series. The Instagram CEO thinks you shouldn't confuse too much Instagramming with addiction, and Sony launched the new WF-1000XM6. Anyway, let's get started. Galaxy S26 is on the way Unpacked 2026 will take place on February 25 this month, where Samsung will unveil its flagship smartphones for the year. The Galaxy S26 series is expected to feature several upgrades, including a new privacy layer to deter shoulder surfers. New magic material Image by 將將 王 via Pexels A team of scientists in China developed a new 2D material that can improve the listening experience for audiophiles. The material, based on solid research and not "snake oil," can reduce audio noise, improve battery performance, and shield against electromagnetic interference (EMI). Prove your age for 'extra' benefits It may be hard to achieve, but the modern web is trying to become a safe place for young users. Discord is implementing new age-assurance policies that will default the platform to teen-appropriate content. Those who wish to go beyond the wall will have to prove their age, according to Discord, which recently filed for an IPO. Instagramming for 16 hours isn't an addiction Image via Gerd Altmann via Pixabay If you can't stop doomscrolling on Instagram too much, you might still not be addicted to it. While testifying for an ongoing trial that accuses Meta of creating addictive features, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri called it "problematic use" but not "clinical addiction" when addressing a plaintiff's claim of spending 16 hours in one day on Instagram. In other news, Meta-owned WhatsApp is working to add voice and video call support to its web version, aligning it with its native apps. This will be good news for Linux users who don't have a native app for their platform. Linux Mint opts for the long haul Speaking of Linux, the team behind Linux Mint is considering abandoning its shorter development cycle because it's spending "more time testing, fixing, and releasing than developing." A longer development cycle could free up resources for substantial development and enable deeper projects. Remote connectivity for iPhone A Weibo leaker with a reliable track record posted that Apple is working to add NR-NTN support to this year's flagship iPhones, fueling old rumors. The technology will enable iPhones to access 5G internet via satellite in areas without cell towers. In other Apple news, rumors around the upcoming AirPods Pro suggest that the wireless earbuds will be 'able to see around you.' Apple is expected to fit infrared cameras on its upcoming AirPods Pro as early as this year. Low-cost MacBook Image for reference Apple is expected to launch a low-cost MacBook this year, featuring the A18 Pro chip, which the company has already used in the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max. Hamid detailed in his roundup that the pocket-friendly MacBook expected to launch in early 2026 and is said to feature a 13-inch LCD (12.9 inches, to be exact) and 8GB RAM. Anything but open The Document Foundation's Italo Vignoli criticized Microsoft's OOXML format for its Office suite and accused the company of overlooking everything for "its own commercial interests." It has long been argued that Microsoft's file formats are intentionally complex to lock people inside its ecosystem. TDF's LibreOffice is largely compatible with Microsoft Office formats, but users occasionally encounter formatting and layout issues. Vignoli said it's "outrageous" when people write things like “OOXML is a standard format, and we have to accept it.” Ghosted by the server User reports surfaced this week that they are unable to download the latest ISOs for Windows Insider channel previews. The unknown issue didn't spare the popular Windows utility app Rufus, whose developer believes Microsoft made changes to the latest builds. It's said that the Redmond giant wants people to fetch Windows ISOs via the official MCT utility. Google x Intel The search giant helped Intel improve a major security feature in its CPUs designed to protect sensitive workloads. Google's Cloud Security team worked with Intel's INT31 research group to analyze features on the TDX Module 1.5 and identified several vulnerabilities. Buy stuff in AI Mode We are already in the future that our forefathers may have imagined. For example, you can use AI to shop online. Similar to ChatGPT's Instant Checkout, AI Mode in Google Search now lets you find items and purchase them without leaving the chat interface. Google developed a Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) in partnership with Etsy, Wayfair, Shopify, and others. Protect yourself on the web Google has rolled out a new tool that lets you report non-consensual intimate images of yourself on Google Search. You can track such requests using the "Results about you’ hub, which now lets you request removal of search results that contain sensitive information, such as your driver's license, passport, or social security number. In other news, Google pushed Chrome 146 to the beta channel this week, featuring WebNN support, Sanitizer API, and other stuff. Google Meet now lets you move presentations to a separate window, freeing up screen space to view participant reactions during the video call. Google Docs has got a touch of NotebookLM, offering AI-generated audio summaries. Burn a smaller hole in your pocket YouTube realized not everyone has $82.99 to spend each month and launched 10+ new YouTube TV plans. In other words, you can pay for what you want to watch across different categories, such as Sports, News, Entertainment, and Family. New users will get discounts on these plans for the first year. After two years of waiting, the native YouTube app is now available for Apple's Vision Pro spatial computing headset. In other words, you can watch YouTube videos on a gigantic virtual screen at the comfort of your couch. iOS 26.3 is here Apple released iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 updates this week for supported iPhones and iPads. Alongside stability improvements and bug fixes, Apple has added a new privacy feature to prevent telecom operators from knowing your exact location. The updates also make it easier to switch to Android with Apple's new Transfer to Android tool. Speaking of updates, you must update your Apple Home app if you haven't already. Following the announcement and multiple reminders, Apple finally discontinued the older HomeKit architecture on February 10. iPhone 17e is on the way Apple's "e" branded iPhone could get a refresh anytime soon. iPhone 16e stocks have reportedly dried up, suggesting an imminent launch of its successor, iPhone 17e. If you're wondering what to expect, the upcoming budget iPhone is expected to address drawbacks like MagSafe. AirTag gets new competition Apple refreshed its Bluetooth item tracker last month with the release of the AirTag 2. The Cupertino giant will soon get competition from Xiaomi, whose unreleased item tracker was listed by various European retailers for several days. The Xiaomi Tag is expected to feature Bluetooth 5.4 and NFC, include a CR2032 battery, and be priced at €17.99 ($21.34) in France. Roger that After setting up bases on consumer devices, ChatGPT's next target is the US military. OpenAI announced that its AI chatbot will be available on GenAI.mil, deploying a custom, secure version for unclassified work. GenAI.mil is an enterprise AI platform from the US DoD that already includes Gemini for Government. The AI giant also upgraded ChatGPT Deep Research with GPT-5.2 and real-time controls. It found a proven way to offset massive infrastructure costs by testing ads on ChatGPT in the US. OpenAI's prominent backer and owner of a 27% stake, Microsoft, has had a change of heart. The Redmond giant said it wants to significantly reduce its dependence on OpenAI and aims to achieve "true AI self-sufficiency" by developing its own frontier-level foundation models. Riding the Coattails? The rise of AI chatbots has also transformed Google Search, with more AI-powered search results now taking up premium screen space. This has pushed digital marketers to flock to platforms like Reddit, which is among the top-cited sources for AI-generated answers. While traditional websites struggle to score organic clicks, showing up authentically in those threads means getting cited by AI. If you have had too much of it, you can read our guide on how to remove AI Overviews from Google Search on Android, iOS, and the web. WF-1000XM6 are here Sony unveiled its flagship WF-1000XM6 wireless earbuds this week, featuring design changes to improve fit. Their new shape follows the inner ear's natural curves to reduce discomfort and improve stability. There is 25% improvement in noise cancellation compared to the 1000XM5, among various upgrades, for a $329.99 USD price tag. A face only an algo could love Image by Sebastian Stam via Pexels Meta plans to bring back its facial recognition feature under a new name. It is reported that the social media giant is developing a feature codenamed "Name Tag" that will enable its Ray-Ban smart glasses to identify faces and retrieve information about people. Android 17 [...loading] There are devices still waiting for last year's Android 16 update, but Google has started meal prep for the next version. The company released the first beta of Android 17 this week, featuring under-the-hood improvements for developers and UX enhancements for consumers. Touching up Plasma 6.6 The KDE team pushed several last minute changes this week for the Plasma 6.6 update, which is coming next Tuesday. Plasma 6.6 will ship with several bug fixes for its compositing window manager, KWin, as well as other improvements. KWin has been hardened against crashes that can occur when a graphics driver unexpectedly resets. Where's the driver? Intel's latest Wi-Fi driver (Version 24.20.0) for Windows 10/11 includes a new toggle that should improve Wi-Fi connectivity. A new setting controls how the drive selects an access point during roaming, allowing you to prioritize access points by channel load or signal strength. Intel's new graphics driver adds XeSS Multi-Frame Generation support to more graphics cards, including Arc discrete GPUs and several Core Ultra CPUs, for supported games. The chipmaker said that the latest version of its frame generation technology improves "by inserting up to 3 generated frames between two rendered frames, going from a 1:1 ratio to 3:1 for an ultra smooth gameplay experience." Meanwhile, AMD's first graphics driver this month brings optimizations for Nioh 3, Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, patches graphical issues in ARC Raiders on RX 9000 GPUs, and fixes crashes in The Finals on RX 7000 systems. What happened at Microsoft this week Image by Marjonhorn via Pixabay "Fun" on Windows 95 CD: Microsoft added a lot of extra stuff to the Windows 95 CD back in the day to flex its capabilities. MS veteran Raymond Chan shed some light on how the company secured rights to a popular music video included on the CD. New CLI for Microsoft Store: If you're someone who likes the old school way of accessing apps and services, Microsoft announced a new command-line interface for the Microsoft Store. Goodbye, Microsoft Lens: You have a few weeks left before the Microsoft Lens app is gone for good on March 9. Microsoft announced the app's retirement last month and is pushing users to use the scanning feature on OneDrive instead. Emoji 16.0 support: Windows 11 Insiders on the Dev and Beta channels were greeted this week with more emojis and new webcam settings that let you directly control pan and tilt for supported cameras. Improving virtual desktop: Microsoft's implementation hasn't been a spark. But Microsoft's VP of Developer Community, Scott Hanselman, took some time to build an app that mimics certain macOS behavior, such as maximizing to a virtual desktop. Send To Kindle: Microsoft Word is bidding a farewell to its "Send to Kindle" feature after three years. But you can switch to Amazon's web tool to keep transferring your DOCX files. Patch Tuesday: The February 2026 Patch Tuesday updates for Windows 11 25H2, 24H2, and 23H2 addressed an issue that prevented some devices from connecting to certain Wi-Fi networks. Another fixed gaming issue determines device eligibility for the full-screen gaming experience. Secure Boot: The original Secure Boot certificates will expire later this year. Microsoft is filling the gap by rolling out new certificates as part of regular Patch Tuesday updates. The quit button: Microsoft has changed how you quit Microsoft Teams to prevent accidental exits during meetings. You can now quit the app using the system tray. Vertical Taskbar: A former Microsoft executive revealed that he "fought hard" to keep the vertical taskbar after it was removed. A credible report from a few days ago said that Microsoft is going bring it back on Windows 11. Windows 11 26H1: Microsoft is preparing an out of ordinary update for the Spring. The company published a detailed blog post about Windows 11 26H1. If you want to know what happened under the Redmond giant's roof this past week, you can read Taras' Microsoft Weekly roundup. GeForce Now comes to Fire TV GeForce Now turned six recently, and the cloud gaming service has set up its new base on Amazon Fire TV devices. Supported devices can stream up to 1080p 60FPS with SDR graphics, H.264 video encoding, and stereo audio. The service has also added eight new games to its supported titles list. For those who weren't able to launch the NVIDIA app on their PCs, the company issued a hotfix to get rid of the problem. You can download NVIDIA App Hotfix 11.0.6.386 from its official website. Improved game reviews Valve released a new update for the Steam client with several interesting features. One of them is the ability to attach your PC specs to each game review, so others can see what hardware you have to run certain games. Big surprises from Sony God of War fans got some big surprises this week at the February State of Play showcase. TC Carson revealed a complete remake of the original trilogy for the franchise. However, little is known about the specifics as the project is in "very early in development." In addition, Sony launched an entirely new game for the PS5, called God of War: Sons of Sparta. 30 years of Rayman The platformer franchise Rayman marked its 30th anniversary, and Ubisoft celebrated it with an anniversary collection in partnership with Digital Eclipse. Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition lets you jump back into the shoes of Rayman and play through multiple versions of the 1995 game. What else in gaming? The latest issue of Pulasthi's Weekly PC Game Deals curates a number of multiplayer games on sale this week. You can get freebies from Epic Games, whose latest giveaway includes Nobody Wants to Die and The Darkside Detective: A Fumble in the Dark. That said, here are some more stories from the gaming world: Two well-received detective games are free to claim on the Epic Games Store No Man's Sky adds trucks for hauling alien cargo and a gravity gun to load them NHL 26, Age of Wonders 4, and more join Xbox Free Play Days this weekend Death Stranding 2 announced for PC with exclusive features AAA John Wick game announced by Space Marine 2 developer From the review corner Curious minds at Neowin got some cool stuff this week for testing and review. Steven got his hands (or his feet) on the Bob and Brad Foot Massager in hopes of getting some much-needed relaxation during his 15-hour work schedule at Neowin. The massager has a low return rate on Amazon, and he found it to be better than the Medisana FM 888, which he had used for years. A downside is that the Bob and Brad massager doesn't remember preferred settings between uses and gets too hot at the highest settings. Steven also published his review of a dual-connector flash drive with USB-A on one side and Type-C on the other. PNY Duo Link V3 was announced at this year's CES, featuring USB 3.2 Gen 2 to achieve 1000MB/s read and 800MB/s write speeds. The flash drive feels premium, but its swivel mechanism cover doesn't protect both connectors at once. The USB-A connector is too long, causing the drive to hang off the port and potentially damaging it over time. If you're looking for portable storage with hardware encryption, check out this week's Lexar TouchLock Portable SSD review. The SSD offers 128-bit AES hardware encryption to maintain security and includes NFC support for pairing with a smartphone. It features seamless unlocking, a compact design, and MagSafe support for iPhone. However, too much security comes with its share of limitations. In addition, Robbie published his review of the Luxsin X8, the world's first DAC/amp with an AI-assisted parametric EQ. Priced at $699, the Luxsin X8 has a smaller footprint than its predecessor, Luxsin X9, from last year. Signing off So, these were some of the biggest tech news and other updates from this week. There will be more issues of our 7 Days series in the coming weeks and months, so stay tuned.

<p>This week's highlights come from Samsung, which announced the launch date for the Galaxy S26 series. The Instagram CEO thinks you shouldn't confuse too much Instagramming with addiction, and Sony launched the new WF-1000XM6. Anyway, let's get started.</p>

<h3>Galaxy S26 is on the way</h3>

<p>Unpacked 2026 <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/galaxy-unpacked-2026-samsung-confirms-launch-date-for-its-latest-galaxy-flagship/">will take place</a> on February 25 this month, where Samsung will unveil its flagship smartphones for the year. The Galaxy S26 series is expected to feature <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-samsung-galaxy-s26-series-before-launch/">several upgrades</a>, including a new privacy layer to deter shoulder surfers.</p>

<h3>New magic material</h3>

<p>A team of scientists in China developed a <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/science-unlocks-new-material-that-could-slash-audio-noise-and-its-no-snake-oil/">new 2D material</a> that can improve the listening experience for audiophiles. The material, based on solid research and not "snake oil," can reduce audio noise, improve battery performance, and shield against electromagnetic interference (EMI).</p>

<h3>Prove your age for 'extra' benefits</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/05/1748030151_discord.webp"><img alt="Discord logo" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/05/1748030151_discord_story.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>It may be hard to achieve, but the modern web is trying to become a safe place for young users. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/you-will-have-to-prove-your-age-to-discord-soon-if-you-want-an-adult-experience/">Discord is implementing</a> new age-assurance policies that will default the platform to teen-appropriate content. Those who wish to go beyond the wall will have to prove their age, according to Discord, which recently filed for an IPO.</p>

<h3>Instagramming for 16 hours isn't an addiction</h3>

</figure>

<p>If you can't stop doomscrolling on Instagram too much, you might still not be addicted to it. While testifying for an ongoing trial that accuses Meta of creating addictive features, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/instagram-ceo-says-scrolling-social-media-for-16-hours-is-not-an-addiction/">called it "problematic use"</a> but not "clinical addiction" when addressing a plaintiff's claim of spending 16 hours in one day on Instagram.</p>

<p>In other news, Meta-owned WhatsApp <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/whatsapp-is-adding-voice-and-video-calls-support-to-its-web-app/">is working</a> to add voice and video call support to its web version, aligning it with its native apps. This will be good news for Linux users who don't have a native app for their platform.</p>

<h3>Linux Mint opts for the long haul</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/05/1746719554_linux-mint.jpg"><img alt="The Linux Mint logo" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/05/1746719554_linux-mint_story.jpg" /></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of Linux, the team behind Linux Mint <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/linux-mint-is-shutting-down-its-shorter-development-cycle/">is considering</a> abandoning its shorter development cycle because it's spending "more time testing, fixing, and releasing than developing." A longer development cycle could free up resources for substantial development and enable deeper projects.</p>

<h3>Remote connectivity for iPhone</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770828409_apple_emergency_sos_via_satellite.webp"><img alt="Apple Emergency SOS via Satellite" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770828409_apple_emergency_sos_via_satellite_story.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>A Weibo leaker with a reliable track record posted that Apple is working to <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/apples-rumored-iphone-18-pro-feature-is-cooler-than-its-ai-expected-this-year/">add NR-NTN support</a> to this year's flagship iPhones, fueling old rumors. The technology will enable iPhones to access 5G internet via satellite in areas without cell towers.</p>

<p>In other Apple news, rumors around the upcoming AirPods Pro suggest that the wireless earbuds will be <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/upcoming-airpods-pro-will-be-able-to-see-around-you-says-leaker/">'able to see around you.'</a> Apple is expected to fit infrared cameras on its upcoming AirPods Pro as early as this year.</p>

<h3>Low-cost MacBook</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/08/1754924703_macbook-air-og-202503.webp"><img alt="MacBook Air M4" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/08/1754924703_macbook-air-og-202503_story.webp" /></a>

<p>Apple is expected to launch a low-cost MacBook this year, featuring the A18 Pro chip, which the company has already used in the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/what-to-expect-from-apples-low-cost-macbook-with-an-iphone-chip/">Hamid detailed in his roundup</a> that the pocket-friendly MacBook expected to launch in early 2026 and is said to feature a 13-inch LCD (12.9 inches, to be exact) and 8GB RAM.</p>

<h3>Anything but open</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770632620_ms-libre.webp"><img alt="Microsoft - LibreOffice logo" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770632620_ms-libre_story.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>The Document Foundation's <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/libreoffice-blasts-microsoft-for-putting-commercial-interests-over-everything/">Italo Vignoli criticized</a> Microsoft's OOXML format for its Office suite and accused the company of overlooking everything for "its own commercial interests." It has long been argued that Microsoft's file formats are intentionally complex to lock people inside its ecosystem.</p>

<p>TDF's LibreOffice is largely compatible with Microsoft Office formats, but users occasionally encounter formatting and layout issues. Vignoli said it's "outrageous" when people write things like “OOXML is a standard format, and we have to accept it.”</p>

<h3>Ghosted by the server</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/09/1758479905_windows_11_iso.webp"><img alt="windows 11 iso" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/09/1758479905_windows_11_iso_story.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>User reports surfaced this week that they are unable to download the latest ISOs for Windows Insider channel previews. The unknown issue didn't spare the popular Windows utility app Rufus, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/rufus-blames-microsoft-for-allegedly-blocking-latest-windows-11-iso-downloads/">whose developer believes</a> Microsoft made changes to the latest builds. It's said that the Redmond giant wants people to fetch Windows ISOs via the official MCT utility.</p>

<h3>Google x Intel</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770743713_google_intel_logo.webp"><img alt="intel and google official logos" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770743713_google_intel_logo_story.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/on-windows-patch-day-google-helped-intel-improve-a-major-security-feature-on-its-cpus/">search giant helped Intel</a> improve a major security feature in its CPUs designed to protect sensitive workloads. Google's Cloud Security team worked with Intel's INT31 research group to analyze features on the TDX Module 1.5 and identified several vulnerabilities.</p>

<h3>Buy stuff in AI Mode</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770896139_google_shopping_ai_mode.webp"><img alt="Shopping Google AI Mode" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770896139_google_shopping_ai_mode.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>We are already in the future that our forefathers may have imagined. For example, you can use AI to shop online. Similar to ChatGPT's Instant Checkout, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/you-can-now-buy-products-in-google-ai-mode-without-leaving-the-search-results/">AI Mode in Google Search now lets you</a> find items and purchase them without leaving the chat interface. Google developed a Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) in partnership with Etsy, Wayfair, Shopify, and others.</p>

<h3>Protect yourself on the web</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770737863_google_image_removal_tool.webp"><img alt="Google Image Removal Tool for Search" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770737863_google_image_removal_tool_story.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>Google has <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/googles-new-tool-removes-your-explicit-images-from-search-heres-how-it-works/">rolled out a new tool</a> that lets you report non-consensual intimate images of yourself on Google Search. You can track such requests using the "Results about you’ hub, which now lets you request removal of search results that contain sensitive information, such as your driver's license, passport, or social security number.</p>

<p>In other news, Google pushed <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/google-promotes-chrome-146-to-the-beta-channel-with-webnn-support-sanitizer-api-and-more/">Chrome 146</a> to the beta channel this week, featuring WebNN support, Sanitizer API, and other stuff.

Google Docs has got a touch of NotebookLM, offering <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/google-docs-now-has-ai-generated-audio-summaries/">AI-generated audio summaries</a>.</p>

<h3>Burn a smaller hole in your pocket</h3>

<p>YouTube realized not everyone has $82.99 to spend each month and launched <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/good-news-for-youtube-tv-users-cheaper-plans-are-now-available/">10+ new YouTube TV plans</a>. In other words, you can pay for what you want to watch across different categories, such as Sports, News, Entertainment, and Family. New users will get discounts on these plans for the first year.</p>

<p>After two years of waiting, the native YouTube app <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/the-official-youtube-app-comes-to-apple-vision-pro/">is now available</a> for Apple's Vision Pro spatial computing headset. In other words, you can watch YouTube videos on a gigantic virtual screen at the comfort of your couch.</p>

<h3>iOS 26.3 is here</h3>

<p>Apple released <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/apple-releases-ios-263-and-ipados-263-to-the-public/" target="_blank">iOS 26.3 and</a> <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/apple-releases-ios-263-and-ipados-263-to-the-public/" target="_blank">iPadOS</a><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/apple-releases-ios-263-and-ipados-263-to-the-public/"> 26.3 updates</a> this week for supported iPhones and iPads. Alongside stability improvements and bug fixes, Apple has added a <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/apples-new-location-privacy-feature-arrives-with-ios-263-on-iphone-and-ipad/">new privacy feature</a> to prevent telecom operators from knowing your exact location. The updates also make it easier to switch to Android with Apple's new Transfer to Android tool.</p>

<p>Speaking of updates, you must update your Apple Home app if you haven't already. Following the announcement and multiple reminders, Apple finally <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/last-day-to-update-apple-home-if-you-want-to-keep-using-your-smart-home-setup/">discontinued the older HomeKit architecture</a> on February 10.</p>

<h3>iPhone 17e is on the way</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/02/1740142922_apple_iphone_16e.jpg"><img alt="Apple iPhone 16e front view" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/02/1740142922_apple_iphone_16e_story.jpg" /></a></figure>

<p>Apple's "e" branded iPhone could get a refresh anytime soon. iPhone 16e stocks have reportedly dried up, suggesting an imminent launch of its successor, iPhone 17e. If you're wondering <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/iphone-17e-might-launch-as-soon-as-next-week-heres-what-to-expect/">what to expect</a>, the upcoming budget iPhone is expected to address drawbacks like MagSafe.</p>

<h3>AirTag gets new competition</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2024/05/1715625877_apple_airtag-front-and-back-emoji-2up_042021.jpg"><img alt="Apple AirTag First-Generation" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2024/05/1715625877_apple_airtag-front-and-back-emoji-2up_042021_story.jpg" /></a></figure>

<p>Apple refreshed its Bluetooth item tracker last month with the release of the AirTag 2. The Cupertino giant will soon get <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/new-leak-reveals-the-price-of-xiaomis-airtag-competitor-xiaomi-tag/">competition from Xiaomi</a>, whose unreleased item tracker was listed by various European retailers for several days. The Xiaomi Tag is expected to feature Bluetooth 5.4 and NFC, include a CR2032 battery, and be priced at €17.99 ($21.34) in France.</p>

<h3>Roger that</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/05/1746737983_openai-logo-red.jpg"><img alt="OpenAI logo" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/05/1746737983_openai-logo-red_story.jpg" /></a></figure>

<p>After setting up bases on consumer devices, ChatGPT's next target is the US military. OpenAI announced that its AI chatbot will be <a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/openai-to-deploy-custom-chatgpt-version-for-us-military/">available on GenAI.mil</a>, deploying a custom, secure version for unclassified work. GenAI.mil is an enterprise AI platform from the US DoD that already includes Gemini for Government.</p>

<p>The AI giant also upgraded ChatGPT Deep Research with GPT-5.2 and real-time controls. It found a proven way to offset massive infrastructure costs by <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/openai-starts-testing-ads-in-chatgpt-in-the-us/">testing ads on ChatGPT</a> in the US.</p>

<p>OpenAI's prominent backer and owner of a 27% stake, Microsoft, has had a change of heart. The Redmond giant said it wants to significantly <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-aims-to-reduce-dependency-on-openai-as-it-pushes-for-ai-self-sufficiency/">reduce its dependence on OpenAI</a> and aims to achieve "true AI self-sufficiency" by developing its own frontier-level foundation models.</p>

<h3>Riding the Coattails?</h3>

<p>The rise of AI chatbots has also transformed Google Search, with more AI-powered search results now taking up premium screen space. This has pushed digital marketers to <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/brands-are-infiltrating-reddit-to-rank-better-on-googles-ai-search/">flock to platforms like Reddit</a>, which is among the top-cited sources for AI-generated answers. While traditional websites struggle to score organic clicks, showing up authentically in those threads means getting cited by AI.</p>

Their new shape follows the inner ear's natural curves to reduce discomfort and improve stability. There is 25% improvement in noise cancellation compared to the 1000XM5, among various upgrades, for a $329.99 USD price tag.</p>

<h3>A face only an algo could love</h3>

<p>Meta plans to bring back its <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/report-meta-plans-to-bring-back-its-facial-recognition-tech-in-a-new-avatar/" target="_blank">facial recognition feature</a> under a new name. It is reported that the social media giant is developing a feature codenamed "Name Tag" that will enable its Ray-Ban smart glasses to identify faces and retrieve information about people.</p>

<p>There are devices still waiting for last year's Android 16 update, but Google has started meal prep for the next version. The company released the <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/android-17-beta-now-available-with-lots-of-ux-improvements/">first beta of Android 17</a> this week, featuring under-the-hood improvements for developers and UX enhancements for consumers.</p>

<h3>Touching up Plasma 6.6</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/06/1750516218_kde-plasma-2.webp"><img alt="KDE Plasma" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/06/1750516218_kde-plasma-2_story.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>The KDE team pushed <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/kde-team-adds-finishing-touches-to-plasma-66-as-stable-release-date-nears/">several last minute changes</a> this week for the Plasma 6.6 update, which is coming next Tuesday. Plasma 6.6 will ship with several bug fixes for its compositing window manager, KWin, as well as other improvements. KWin has been hardened against crashes that can occur when a graphics driver unexpectedly resets.</p>

<h3>Where's the driver?</h3>

<p>Intel's latest Wi-Fi driver (Version 24.20.0) for Windows 10/11 includes a new toggle that should improve Wi-Fi connectivity. A new setting controls how the drive selects an access point during roaming, allowing you to prioritize access points by channel load or signal strength.</p>

<p>Intel's new graphics driver adds <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/intel-expands-xess-multi-frame-generation-to-battlemage-alchemist-gpus-and-more/" target="_blank">XeSS Multi-Frame Generation support</a> to more graphics cards, including Arc discrete GPUs and several Core Ultra CPUs, for supported games. The chipmaker said that the latest version of its frame generation technology improves "by inserting up to 3 generated frames between two rendered frames, going from a 1:1 ratio to 3:1 for an ultra smooth gameplay experience."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/amds-new-driver-2621-fixes-color-corruption-adds-nioh-3-support-and-more/">AMD's first graphics driver this month</a> brings optimizations for <em>Nioh 3</em>, <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, </em>patches graphical issues in <em>ARC Raiders</em> on RX 9000 GPUs, and fixes crashes in <em>The Finals</em> on RX 7000 systems.</p>

<p><em>God of War</em> fans got some big surprises this week at the February State of Play showcase. TC Carson <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/sony-reveals-a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-and-shadow-drops-a-prequel-game/">revealed a complete remake</a> of the original trilogy for the franchise. However, little is known about the specifics as the project is in "very early in development." In addition, Sony launched an entirely new game for the PS5, called <em>God of War: Sons of Sparta</em>.</p>

<h3>30 years of Rayman</h3>

<h3>From the review corner</h3>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770730426_20260210_142110.webp"><img alt="bob and brad foot massager" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770730426_20260210_142110_story.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>Curious minds at Neowin got some cool stuff this week for testing and review. Steven got his hands (or his feet) on the <a href="https://www.neowin.net/reviews/bob-and-brad-foot-massager-721-pro-review-shiatsu-massage-and-heat-for-your-feet/">Bob and Brad Foot Massager</a> in hopes of getting some much-needed relaxation during his 15-hour work schedule at Neowin.</p>

<p>The massager has a low return rate on Amazon, and he found it to be better than the Medisana FM 888, which he had used for years. A downside is that the Bob and Brad massager doesn't remember preferred settings between uses and gets too hot at the highest settings.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770818875_20260211_130946.webp"><img alt="pny duo link v3" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770818875_20260211_130946_story.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>Steven also published his review of a dual-connector flash drive with USB-A on one side and Type-C on the other. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/reviews/pny-duo-link-v3-flash-drive-review-type-a-and-type-c-to-maximize-compatibility/">PNY Duo Link V3</a> was announced at this year's CES, featuring USB 3.2 Gen 2 to achieve 1000MB/s read and 800MB/s write speeds. The flash drive feels premium, but its swivel mechanism cover doesn't protect both connectors at once. The USB-A connector is too long, causing the drive to hang off the port and potentially damaging it over time.</p>

<p>If you're looking for portable storage with hardware encryption, check out this week's <a href="https://www.neowin.net/reviews/lexar-touchlock-portable-ssd-review-128-bit-aes-hardware-encryption-with-nfc/">Lexar TouchLock Portable SSD review</a>. The SSD offers 128-bit AES hardware encryption to maintain security and includes NFC support for pairing with a smartphone. It features seamless unlocking, a compact design, and MagSafe support for iPhone. However, too much security comes with its share of limitations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770073289_2026.01.20_0028-34_00079.webp"><img alt="Luxsin X8" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770073289_2026.01.20_0028-34_00079_story.webp" /></a></figure>

<p>In addition, Robbie published his review of the <a href="https://www.neowin.net/reviews/worlds-first-dacamp-with-an-ai-assisted-parametric-eq-this-is-the-luxsin-x8-review/">Luxsin X8</a>, the world's first DAC/amp with an AI-assisted parametric EQ. Priced at $699, the Luxsin X8 has a smaller footprint than its predecessor, Luxsin X9, from last year.</p>

<p>Users have started reporting visible dents on the iPhone 17 Pro Max even when the phone sits inside a protective case, which undermines the whole purpose of buying a case and shifts attention toward the material Apple selected for the frame rather than accidental handling.</p>



<p>Apple equipped the iPhone 17 Pro Max with a 5080-series aluminum alloy, while the standard iPhone 17 uses a 6000-series alloy, and this difference matters because the Pro Max frame prioritizes heat dissipation instead of structural rigidity, so impacts that normally leave a mark on the case now transfer enough force to deform the softer frame.</p>

<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/iAm_erica/status/2022025031795331431">posts shared</a> by Erica Griffin, the damage appeared despite a protective shell, and she wrote, “we all know aluminum is soft… but yeah, #iPhone17ProMax really will dent in a case if it falls,” adding that the case itself remained fine after a fall from a stroller height.</p>

<p>Soon after, tipster Schrödinger <a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/phonefuturist/status/2022278808686956913">explained</a> the reasoning behind Apple’s choice, stating, “The iPhone 17 Pro Max is using a 5080 because of thermal management… Apple picked alloy for heat dissipation over just raw tensile strength.”</p>



<h2>Heat design vs durability</h2>



<p>Apple paired the alloy with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/tips/round-ups/iphone-17-pro-vapor-chamber-tested/">vapor chamber cooling system</a> that circulates deionized water inside a sealed aluminum chamber where liquid absorbs heat, becomes vapor, transfers heat to the frame, and condenses back into liquid to repeat the cycle, which helps the A20 Pro chip maintain performance under load without throttling.</p>



<p>However, the same thermal advantage weakens resistance to corner impacts, so drops that normally result in cosmetic case scuffs now leave permanent frame dents, and that creates a trade-off where performance stability improves but long-term appearance suffers.</p>



<p>The base iPhone 17 avoids this issue because its 6000-series aluminum focuses more on strength, which explains why similar fall reports rarely mention dents on that model even without heavy cases.</p>

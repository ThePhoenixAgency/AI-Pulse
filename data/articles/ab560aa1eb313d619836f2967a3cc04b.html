    <div><div><article><div><p>Apple's first-generation AirTag 4-Pack has dropped to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>$64.00</strong></a> this week on Amazon, down from the original price of $99.00. Free shipping options have a delivery estimate around February 21, while Prime members should be able to get it delivered a few days sooner.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/BFLogWFp5orrM-aMeQjEXIYAV-s=/400x0/article-new/2025/03/airtag-blue-hue.jpeg?lossy" alt="airtag blue hue" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<p>Overall, this is a solid second-best price on the AirTag 4-pack that's within $1 of the Amazon all-time low price. Amazon's stock on the first generation AirTag 1-Pack has begun dwindling now that the new second generation models are here, so anyone interested in this low price on the first gen 4-Pack should pick it up while it's still around.</p>

<p>Apple just <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/26/apple-announces-new-airtag/">debuted</a> the all-new AirTag, featuring longer range for tracking items and a louder speaker. We haven't tracked any discounts on the new second generation models as of yet, so anyone who wants to save money should keep looking into the original models.</p>

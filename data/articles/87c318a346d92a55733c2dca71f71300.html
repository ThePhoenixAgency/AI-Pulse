    <div><div><p>Israel and the US have launched a war on Iran, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> declaring the start of “major combat operations” and calling on Iranians to rise up against their government.</p><p>The US president’s comments came soon after explosions were heard across central Tehran. One apparent strike hit near the offices of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> is preparing a “crushing retaliation”, an Iranian official told Reuters.</p><p>Iran launched a retaliatory wave of missiles and drones at targets in Israel and at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US military</a> bases across the Middle East. Explosions were heard in Israel, Bahrain, home of the US fleet in the Middle East, Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the UAE, Kuwait and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.<strong> </strong></p><p>Israel had earlier declared a state of emergency, warning civilians to stay near air raid shelters, in anticipation of Iranian drone and missile strikes in response.</p><p>Iran and Israel both closed their airspace to civilian flights.</p><figure></figure><p>The attack on Iran came hours after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/27/us-urges-citizens-leave-israel-threat-strike-iran">Trump said he was “not happy”</a> about the latest negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme.</p><p>The US had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/19/us-military-buildup-in-middle-east-intensifies-but-to-what-end">built up a large military presence in the region</a> in recent weeks in preparation for an attack, including two aircraft carrier strike groups.</p><p>Both the US and Israel called for regime change in Iran and urged a popular uprising after Saturday’s attacks.</p><p>Trump called on the Iranian people to “take over your government” in a video on his Truth Social platform. He offered the Iranian military “immunity” should they surrender, or “certain death” if not, and told Iranians the “hour of your freedom is at hand”, urging them to rise up and “take over your government”.</p><figure><div><figcaption><span></span><span>'Lay down your weapons': Trump warns Iran's armed forces as US launches military operation – video</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>Israel directly addressed Iranians in a Persian-language post on a dedicated Telegram channel.</p><p>“Our Iranian brothers and sisters, you are not alone!” the post said, calling on Iranians to upload photos and video of anti-regime protests. “Together we will return Iran to its glorious days.”</p><p>Trump and the Israeli military described their attacks as a pre-emptive strike against Iranian threats.</p><p>By late morning the scale of Iran’s attacks across the Middle East was becoming clear, as its Revolutionary Guards commanders insisted there were no red lines and no targets off limits. Explosions heard in Bahrain, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait suggest Iran has activated its plan to try to hit as many US bases in the region as possible. Iran said warnings had been given to the Gulf states’ leaders explicitly in the past and that no one should be surprised by what was to come. The UAE and Kuwait closed their airspace in a bid to protect themselves.</p><p>Iranian officials added they had not been surprised by the US attacks and that the consequences would “be long lasting and extensive. All scenarios were on the table including ones that were not previously considered.”</p><p>Iranian state television reported that the president, Masoud Pezeshkian, was “safe and sound”, while the Fars news agency said seven “missile impacts” were reported in the Keshvardoost and Pasteur districts of Tehran.</p><p>The strikes come weeks after Iranian authorities killed thousands of people as they crushed mass protests, according to rights groups.</p></div></div>

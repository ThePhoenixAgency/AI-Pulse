<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.19.1-Released">Linux 6.19.1</a> was released earlier today while it's since been replaced by Linux 6.19.2 to address fallout from that first point release with some systems not booting. This also resulted in new LTS kernel releases too due to the problematic code being picked up there too.
</p><p>
Linux 6.19.1 had back-ported a core driver change to enforce device_lock for driver_match_device() but it inadvertently broke the ability to boot the new kernel for many users. Thus an immediate bug-fix release to revert this problematic patch.
</p><p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman explained in <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?h=linux-6.19.y&amp;id=03db4dc9ad6eb91e640b517e00373ce877682854">the patch</a> reverting the change -- and the sole code change of Linux 6.19.2 -- as:
</p><blockquote>"It causes boot regressions on some systems as all of the "fixes" for drivers are not properly backported yet.  Once that is completed, only then can this be applied, if really necessary given the potential for explosions, perhaps we might want to wait a few -rc releases first..."</blockquote>
<p>Adjusting those few lines of code restores the ability to boot for affected users.
</p><p>
Those interested can find Linux 6.19.2 on the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/2026021619-phrasing-booth-18a8@gregkh/">kernel mailing list</a>.
</p><p>
Similarly, <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/2026021637-chair-unsecured-7fe1@gregkh/T/#t">Linux 6.18.12</a>, <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/2026021612-rectangle-overturn-ddbe@gregkh/T/#t">Linux 6.12.73</a>, and <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/2026021650-calculate-lucrative-5b1c@gregkh/T/#t">Linux 6.6.126</a> are all available too with just reverting this problematic code causing boot issues on affected hardware/drivers.</p></div></div>

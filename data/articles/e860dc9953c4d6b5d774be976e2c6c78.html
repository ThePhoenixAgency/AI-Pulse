</blockquote><p>Peters said the task of ensuring strong relations wasn’t helped by political turnover.</p><p>“It makes your job harder because you keep on getting new leaders,” he said, before joking he may not need to begin fresh relationship-building with the new Liberal foreign affairs spokesperson, <strong>Ted O’Brien</strong>.</p><p>“The way the polls are going, maybe not,” he said.</p><figure><div><img alt="Winston Peters" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a452c1cc6475b298162e476d78e8e4a5bf3eeb41/0_0_3378_2252/master/3378.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Winston Peters.</span> Photograph: Mark Tantrum/AP</figcaption></figure></article><article><header><div><p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/08/06/Josh_Taylor.png?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a1e8502bb438342885b78582aeeb8ce9" alt="Josh Taylor"></p><p><span>Josh Taylor</span></p></div></header><p><strong>Tony Burke defends temporary exclusion order against woman</strong></p><p>Burke revealed that the decision to make a temporary exclusion order against one woman on Monday – who he revealed came to Australia and became a citizen under the Howard government and went to Syria under the Abbott government – was made after reports of the group leaving the camp and preparing to return to Australia had surfaced.</p><p>Burke said it would not have made sense to issue the order earlier because it is set for two years.</p><p>Burke said if the children were able to return to Australia they would face a similar situation to those who returned under the Morrison government, but he said the parents “may well decide to never come back” because they would “face the full force of the law” for those who are found to have committed crimes.</p><p>Burke said he had a different view on the situation to <strong>Jamal Rifi</strong> – who reports claim is assisting the group – and said the prime minister’s response on the issue had not changed since before the Bondi terror attack.</p></article><article><header><h2>Burke attacks ‘silly hypocrisy’ from Coalition over IS-linked families</h2><div><p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/08/06/Josh_Taylor.png?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a1e8502bb438342885b78582aeeb8ce9" alt="Josh Taylor"></p><p><span>Josh Taylor</span></p></div></header><p>The home affairs minister, <strong>Tony Burke</strong>, told the ABC’s 7.30 program last night that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition">Coalition</a> pressure to prevent the 34 Australian wives and children of IS fighters killed or captured in Syria from returning to Australia was “silly hypocrisy”.</p><p>He said if the Coalition wants the group excluded from Australia permanently, “they should look at the laws they voted for, they put in place when they were in government”.</p><blockquote> <p>There’s a lot of very silly deeply hypocritical claims coming from the opposition today.</p>

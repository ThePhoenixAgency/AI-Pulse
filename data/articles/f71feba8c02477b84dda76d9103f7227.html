    <div><div><p>Large institutional investors continued to add exposure to crypto treasury companies over the past week, even as bear-market illiquidity forced another round of shakeouts across decentralized finance (DeFi).</p><p>The biggest corporate shareholders of Bitmine Immersion Technologies, including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, increased exposure to the Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH)</a> treasury company during Q4 2025 despite a broader market sell-off.</p><p>Still, ongoing bear-market illiquidity is forcing some protocols to wind down operations, with DeFi lender ZeroLend shutting down. Crypto analytics platform Parsec has also shuttered, citing crypto market volatility as the main reason.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC)</a> and ETH each rose about 2.6% during the past week, amid mounting outflows from US spot <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-etf-133-million-outflows-extreme-fear-sentiment">Bitcoin exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs), which logged three consecutive days of selling leading up to Thursday’s $165 million outflow, Farside Investors <a href="https://farside.co.uk/btc/" target="_blank">data</a> shows.</p><p>Ether ETFs started the week with $48 million in inflows on Tuesday, but reversed to log two successive days of outflows, including $41 million in outflows on Wednesday and $130 million on Thursday.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7ae0-66e3-7e35-abbf-fd38415dc3ec.png"><figcaption><em>Bitcoin ETF Flow, USD million.

Average sale prices also declined year-on-year, falling to $96 from $124, according to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-supply-growth-sales-decline-2025">CryptoSlam data</a>.</p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/parsec-defi-nft-analytics-platform-closes-market-volatility"><strong>Continue reading</strong></a></p><h2>Kraken’s xStocks tops $25 billion in volume with more than 80,000 onchain holders</h2><p>Kraken’s tokenized equities platform, xStocks, has surpassed $25 billion in total transaction volume less than eight months after launch, underscoring accelerating adoption as tokenization gains traction among mainstream investors.</p><p>Kraken <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/product/xstocks/25-billion-in-total-transaction-volume" target="_blank">disclosed</a> Thursday that the $25 billion figure includes trading across centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges, as well as minting and redemption activity. The milestone represents a 150% increase since November, when <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/xstocks-10b-volume-launch-tokenized-stocks-gain-traction">xStocks crossed $10 billion</a> in cumulative transaction volume.</p><p>The xStocks tokens are issued by Backed Finance, a regulated asset provider that creates 1:1 backed tokenized representations of publicly traded equities and exchange-traded funds. Kraken serves as a primary distribution and trading venue, while Backed is responsible for structuring and issuing the tokenized instruments.</p><p>When xStocks debuted in 2025, it offered more than 60 tokenized equities, including shares tied to major US technology companies like Amazon, Meta Platforms, Nvidia and Tesla.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7ae0-722c-7184-97cb-24cabd32097f.png"><figcaption><em>Source: </em><a href="https://x.com/xStocksFi/status/2024519653930770745" target="_blank"><em>xStocks</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Kraken said onchain activity has been a key growth driver since launch, with xStocks generating $3.5 billion in onchain trading volume and surpassing 80,000 unique onchain holders.</p><p>Unlike trading that occurs solely within centralized exchanges’ internal order books, onchain activity takes place directly on public blockchains, where transactions are transparent and wallets can self-custody assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Growing onchain participation suggests users are not only <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/tokenization-explained">trading tokenized equities</a> but also integrating them into broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems.</p><p>Kraken said that eight of the 11 largest tokenized equities by unique holder count are now part of the xStocks ecosystem, signaling increased market share in the emerging tokenized equities sector.</p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/kraken-xstocks-25b-tokenized-equities-volume"><strong>Continue reading</strong></a></p><h2><strong>DeFi market overview</strong></h2><p>According to data from <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/markets">Cointelegraph Markets Pro</a> and TradingView, most of the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ended the week in the green.</p><p>The layer-1 blockchain Kite (KITE) token rose 38% as the biggest gainer in the top 100, followed by stablecoin payment ecosystem token Stable (STABLE), up over 30% during the past week.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7ae0-74ec-73fc-aa10-6e80263256db.png"><figcaption><em>Total value locked in DeFi.

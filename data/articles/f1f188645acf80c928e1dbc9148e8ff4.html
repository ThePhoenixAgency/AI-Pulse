"><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Value-conscious but aspirational Indians are driving the growth in branded budget apparel </figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>At a gleaming three-storey outlet of Reliance Trends in the town of Sangli in western India, Alka browses through a collection of Indian ethnic-wear kurtas in an array of vibrant colours.</p></div><div><p>A geriatric care worker in her late 50s, she is looking for a design in a particular shade of baby pink with a dull gold paisley motif.</p></div><div><p>"I saw someone wearing it at my workplace and I loved it so much, I immediately wanted to buy one for my daughter," Alka told the BBC.</p></div><div><p>Across its three floors, the outlet has racks displaying all kinds of trendy apparel, from funky printed t-shirts and weathered jeans to formal office wear for men and women and in-house labels selling Indian or fusion mix-and-match clothes.</p></div><div><p>On display are also make-up kits, sneakers, handbags and costume jewellery.</p></div><div><p>Shopping here in the air-conditioned comfort of the store, with trial rooms, attendants and scratch cards offering discounts on her next purchase, is a refreshingly new experience for Alka. </p></div><div><p>Like most Indians, she has only ever hunted for white label bargains in street-side bazaars all her life.</p></div><div><p>However, budget brands like Trends - run by<a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-62949003"> Isha Ambani</a>, heiress to the Reliance Industries retail empire founded by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani - and Tata's Zudio are now offering goods at the same price point as the bazaar, but with a vastly improved shopping experience.</p></div><div><p>In these outlets, most merchandise costs between $4 (£2.90) and $15. "Plus, the designs are contemporary and there's a growing desire among people to wear branded clothes," Pankaj Kumar, a retail analyst at Mumbai-based Kotak Securities, told the BBC.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/485a/live/1dd6a9b0-0d9d-11f1-8168-03d32f3820eb.jpg.webp" alt="Reliance Retail A neon-lit facade of a Trends showroom lit up at dusk. "><span>Reliance Retail</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Trends is run by Isha Ambani, the heiress to the retail arm of India's largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group </figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>This explosion in the number of value-conscious yet aspirational consumers, especially in smaller towns, is driving extraordinary bottomline growth in the country's organised fast-fashion industry, led by brands such as Max, Vishaal Mega Mart, Trends and Zudio.</p></div><div><p>Quarterly numbers for Trends are not publicly available, but Zudio's growth has wildly outpaced global high-street titans like Zara and H&amp;M, as well as the Tata Group's own mid-to-premium range fashion brand Westside, in the past few years. </p></div><div><p>Consider these figures: in 2018, Zudio had merely seven stores across the country and clocked $12m in revenue. Westside was a much bigger brand, with 125 stores bringing in around $220m.</p></div><div><p>Today, the tables have completely turned.</p></div><div><p>Zudio's seven stores have expanded to 765, with revenues crossing $1bn by the middle of 2025 - making it the only Indian clothing brand to hold that distinction.</p></div><div><p>Westside on the other hand has doubled its store count, with revenue growing three-fold - but the pace of growth is nowhere near comparable.</p></div><div><p>"It's a classic bottom-of-the-pyramid strategy - go big by going mass," says Kotak Securities, about Zudio's success, adding that pricing has been a key factor, given that "even affordable fashion is a luxury in India's tier-2 and tier-3 towns".</p></div><div><p>But what's driving this spending at a time when India's job market has been weak, wages haven't really grown rapidly and overall private consumption, which makes up 60% of GDP, has remained patchy?</p></div><div><p>"It's very clearly a wallet-shift," says Kushal Bhatnagar of Bengaluru-based Redseer Strategy Consultants. </p></div><div><p>"Consumers are not buying much more than they were; but they've shifted their purchases from mom-and-pop stores to branded outlets."</p></div><div><p>This shift is the result of a major push by budget brands to rapidly penetrate zip-codes and go into the deepest pockets of India.</p></div><div><p>And the likes of Zudio and Max have brought about the "trendification" of affordable fashion for the first time, appealing to Gen-Z and young millennial buyers, by trawling the latest fads in Paris and Milan. </p></div><div><p>An early partnership between Trent - Zudio's parent brand – and Zara helped it apply the Spanish fast fashion giant's playbook to its growth strategy, says Bhatnagar.</p></div><div><p>Just like Zara, Zudio manages incredibly quick inventory turnaround of just 15 days versus the 45-60 days taken by its rivals.</p></div><div><p>"In the world of fashion, the speed of inventory is everything," says Kumar of Kotak Securities. The quicker new styles hit the shelves, the more frequent are the store visits.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f944/live/e27c9cc0-0d9d-11f1-8168-03d32f3820eb.jpg.webp" alt="Universal Images Group via Getty Images A woman shopping in a colourful marketplace in Jaipur city, India, with a 'sale' placard behind her in Hindi. "><span>Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Most Indians still largely buy unbranded goods from street-side bazaars </figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>This growth has, however, come at a cost to local mom-and-pop stores on the high street.</p></div><div><p>They are facing competition not just from budget brands but also from e-commerce websites like Meesho, which aggregates sellers on its digital platform and ships cheap goods across India. It has been growing its bottomline at 35-40% year-on-year.</p></div><div><p>"When GDP-per-capita begins to go up for a country, branded goods and online shopping naturally becomes a more prominent part of retail," says Bhatnagar.</p></div><div><p>But the real challenge now, he says, is to get a "consumption uplift", so that along with a shift in wallet-share there's also a growth in the overall market size. India's apparel market is currently estimated to be between $70bn to $100bn. </p></div><div><p>"We underspend on apparel. Our spend per-capita is much lower than China, US or even Indonesia. In a good year this market should typically grow at 12-15%. We've been at sub-10% growth in the past few years."</p></div><div><p>Despite the tepid growth in market size, the rise of fast-fashion is accompanied by growing worries about the sector's ecological impact. </p></div><div><p>The textile industry is the third-largest contributor to dry municipal solid waste in India - after plastics, and paper and cardboard - according to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/waste/indias-fashion-paradox-as-the-industry-booms-it-is-being-buried-under-heap-of-its-own-waste">recent report</a>. And only a quarter of it is recycled.</p></div><div><p>"While some brands are embedding sustainability into their supply chains, true large-scale change remains distant," according to Deloitte, which estimates less than 1% of used clothing is recycled into new garments and recycled fibres globally. </p></div><div><p>For now though, style and savings appear to have trumped concerns about sustainability, with many small-town Indians only just getting on to the fast-fashion bandwagon. </p></div></article></div></div>

          <p><a href="https://www.warp.dev/?ref=itsfoss.com">Warp</a> has established itself as a known name in modern developer tooling.</p><p>The company's terminal application combines traditional command-line functionality with AI-powered features, letting developers write code, debug issues, and manage projects with ease.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.warp.dev/blog/oz-orchestration-platform-cloud-agents?ref=itsfoss.com">they announced Oz</a>, a new service for managing AI coding agents in cloud environments.</p><div><p>🚧</p><p><b><strong>Warp is not open source software. It's covered here because it is a software available for Linux.</strong></b></p></div><h2>Oz by Warp: What to Expect?</h2><figure></figure><p>At its core, <strong>Oz handles the infrastructure side of running AI coding agents</strong>. Instead of setting up your own systems for sandboxing, monitoring, and coordinating these agents, you get a ready-made platform that does it for you.</p><p>It is focused on team collaboration. When you configure an environment (<em>essentially a Docker container linked to your Git repositories</em>), that setup becomes available to everyone on your team. Each running agent gets <a href="https://docs.warp.dev/agent-platform/cloud-agents/agent-session-sharing?ref=itsfoss.com">a URL</a> you can share, letting teammates track progress or take over if needed.</p><p><strong>What can these agents do you ask?</strong> They can write code spanning multiple repositories, push commits, open pull requests, run tests, and make fixes without requiring constant human supervision. </p><p>Warp has shared a few examples where they built an automated fraud detector that scans for suspicious Warp account activity three times a day.</p><p>In another case, a Warp developer used Oz to port the <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/?ref=itsfoss.com">mermaid.js</a> JavaScript visualization library to Rust by running multiple agents, each handling a different diagram type, and in another, they created an issue triage app that lets engineers review GitHub issues and dispatch agents to tackle them.</p><p>You can control it through various interfaces. There's a command-line tool, a REST API with SDK libraries, a web dashboard, and integration with <a href="https://app.warp.dev/referral/6N3LPK?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Warp's terminal app</a> (<em>partner link</em>).</p><p>You can start agents manually or schedule them to run at specific times. The platform also works with <a href="https://docs.warp.dev/agent-platform/cloud-agents/skills-as-agents?ref=itsfoss.com">Skills</a>, which are reusable instruction sets compatible with various coding agent systems.</p><h2>Get Started with Oz</h2><p><a href="https://www.warp.dev/oz?ref=itsfoss.com">Oz</a> works with any Warp account, <strong>free</strong> or <strong>paid</strong>. Pricing depends on how much AI inference and cloud computing you consume, measured in credits.</p><p>This month, both new and existing <a href="https://www.warp.dev/pricing?ref=itsfoss.com">subscribers</a> on the <em>Build</em>,<em> Business</em>, and <em>Max</em> tiers receive 1,000 complimentary credits for cloud-hosted agents.</p><p>Companies wanting to run Oz on their own servers <strong>can opt for self-hosting</strong>, and the web interface at <a href="https://oz.warp.dev/?ref=itsfoss.com">oz.warp.dev</a> serves as a management console where you can oversee active agents.</p><hr /><p><strong>Suggested Read 📖:</strong> <a href="https://itsfoss.com/qwen-code-sysadmin-tasks/"><em>I Ditched Claude Code</em></a></p><figure><a href="https://itsfoss.com/qwen-code-sysadmin-tasks/"><div><p>I Ditched Claude Code and Now Using Open Source Qwen AI for Real Sysadmin Work</p><p>An AI assistant in the terminal can help you guide through the process, help you move faster with your tasks. I tested Qwen Code and share my findings with you.</p><p><img src="https://itsfoss.com/content/images/icon/android-chrome-512x512-275.png" alt="" /><span>It's FOSS</span><span>Bhuwan Mishra</span></p></div><p><img src="https://itsfoss.com/content/images/thumbnail/qwen-code-banner.png" alt="" /></p></a></figure>

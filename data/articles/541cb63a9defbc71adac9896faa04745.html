    <div><div>
<p>For the most sought-after founders, the prestige of a top-tier accelerator is increasingly weighed against giving up a significant ownership stake in their company.</p> <p>&nbsp;Ali Partovi, the veteran investor and CEO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/27/from-coding-tests-to-billion-dollar-startups-ali-partovis-eight-year-experiment-is-paying-off/" target="_blank">venture firm Neo</a>, wants to offer the mentorship and community of one of the most elite accelerator programs — without forcing the best up-and-coming tech leaders to hand over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/06/ycombinator-demo-day-investors/" target="_blank">7%</a> or sometimes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/how-to-get-into-a16zs-super-competitive-speedrun-startup-accelerator-program/" target="_blank">10%</a> of their company before they’ve even started.</p> <p>Partovi, who is known for his early investments in Facebook, Cursor, and Kalshi, has just introduced <a href="https://neo.substack.com/p/83a288ef-48c4-420f-a799-6ca85f85db03?postPreview=paid&amp;updated=2026-02-18T16%3A19%3A56.159Z&amp;audience=everyone&amp;free_preview=false&amp;freemail=true" target="_blank">Neo Residency</a>, a new, competitively structured program that combines the firm’s now four-year-old accelerator with a track for current college students.</p> <p>The terms that Neo Residency offers are so founder-friendly as to be “not even comparable to any other accelerator,” Partovi told TechCrunch.</p> <p>For the cohort of 12 to 15 startups entering the program this summer, Neo will invest $750,000 via an uncapped SAFE — a contract that gives an investor future equity in exchange for money now, with no ceiling on the valuation used to calculate that stake. Unlike the fixed-percentage deals typical of other accelerators, Neo won’t receive its equity until the company’s next formal funding round, and even then, the dilution is tied to valuation. If a startup raises its next round at a $15 million valuation, Neo’s stake will be 5%, but if that valuation hits $100 million, the firm’s ownership drops to just 0.75%.</p> <p>“We take the risk up front, so this is extremely favorable to startups,” Partovi said.</p> <p>In comparison, Y Combinator&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/deal" target="_blank">typically takes a fixed 7%</a>&nbsp;of the company for $125,000, with another $375,000 invested on an uncapped MFN — or most-favored nation — SAFE, a clause that ensures early investors get terms at least as good as those given to later ones. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz’s Speedrun program typically invests $500,000 in exchange for 10% of the startup via a SAFE note, and another $500,000 if the next round is raised within 18 months at whatever terms are agreed to by the other investors.</p>
<div> <p>Techcrunch event</p> <div> <p><span>Boston, MA</span> <span>|</span> <span>June 9, 2026</span> </p> </div> </div> <p>“We’re offering a deal so great that it’s appropriate even for founders who are not even considering any other accelerator,” Partovi said.</p> <p>&nbsp;The lower equity cost is only part of Neo Residency’s appeal.</p> <p>The founders will work for three months at Neo’s offices in San Francisco’s Jackson Square district, participate in a two-week bootcamp in the Oregon mountains, and be mentored by about 30 experienced operators, including Russell Kaplan, president of Cognition, and Fuzzy Khosrowshahi, CTO of Notion (and the creator of <a href="https://bubble.io/blog/the-new-build-02-fuzzy-khosrowshahi/" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a> and also Partovi’s uncle).</p> <p>But the program’s main draw is its prestige: Seed and Series A investors generally have great respect for founders handpicked by Partovi.</p> <p>“The one [accelerator] I like right now that has very high signal, and every founder I met there is just wicked smart, is Neo,” Wesley Chan, co-founder and managing partner of FPV Ventures, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILQ6WkufBs8&amp;t=1732s" target="_blank">said onstage at 2025 TechCrunch Disrupt</a>.</p> <p>Startups that have gone through the program include Moment, a fintech company that has raised <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-13/ai-startup-cursor-raises-funds-at-29-3-billion-value-wsj-says" target="_blank">$56 million</a> from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, and Anterior, a healthcare AI startup backed by NEA and Sequoia.</p> <p>The Neo Residency will also select five to eight students — either as individuals or small teams — who will receive a $40,000, no-strings-attached grant to take a semester off to work on a project. While there is no requirement to drop out or start a formal company immediately, Partovi said he hopes the students will catch the entrepreneurial bug and, when they eventually launch a startup, turn to Neo for funding.</p> <p>Neo is keeping the program small and elite: It will cap its two annual cohorts at 20 teams each, consisting of a mix of active startups and student projects.</p> <p>Why is Neo offering such generous terms? “We have more confidence in our ability to attract and pick out future superstars than ever before,” Partovi said.</p> <p>His track record suggests that confidence is well-founded. He famously met Cursor co-founder Michael Truell while Truell was still an MIT student and later wrote one of the first checks into the AI coding startup, now valued at nearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/coding-assistant-cursor-raises-2-3b-5-months-after-its-previous-round/" target="_blank">$30 billion</a>.</p>

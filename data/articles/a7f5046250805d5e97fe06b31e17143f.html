<li>Prosecutors say scammers often shift chats to encrypted apps before pushing crypto payments or investments.</li>
<li>Analysts warn the schemes use slow trust-building, sometimes allowing small withdrawals to bait larger deposits.</li>
<li>U.S. officials link the frauds to Southeast Asian crime networks laundering stolen crypto.</li>
</ul></div><p><span>U.S. prosecutors are warning that Valentine’s Day may be peak season not just for flowers and dating apps, but for romance scams increasingly tied to crypto fraud and organized crime networks.</span></p><p><span>In an </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndoh/pr/cupid-doesnt-ask-crypto-us-attorneys-office-warns-public-about-romance-scams-ahead" target="_blank"><span>alert</span></a><span> issued Thursday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Ohio urged the public to remain vigilant as scammers exploit online relationships to extract money, often steering victims toward crypto payments and fake investment schemes after weeks or months of trust-building.</span></p><p><span>Many of these </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndoh/pr/ghanaian-national-charged-running-romance-scams-took-over-8-million-elderly-victims" target="_blank"><span>cases</span></a><span> now intersect with what researchers describe as “pig butchering” schemes, long-form frauds that combine emotional grooming with fake crypto investment platforms.</span></p><p><span>Ohio prosecutors warn that red flags include requests to migrate conversations off dating platforms to WhatsApp or Telegram, early declarations of love, persistent refusal to meet in person, and payment requests via crypto, gift cards, or wire transfer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Balazs Faluvegi, senior analyst at </span><a href="https://brokerchooser.com/best-brokers/best-forex-brokers" target="_blank"><span>BrokerChooser</span></a><span>, told </span><i><span>Decrypt</span></i><span> that what makes these schemes so destructive is precisely what makes them so hard to see coming.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Unlike traditional scams, which execute quickly, these schemes exploit both emotional and financial vulnerabilities," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Scammers spend weeks or even months building your trust before introducing seemingly lucrative investment opportunities, casually mentioning their success, and offering to teach you. Remember, no random stranger has a genuine interest in helping you make money,” he added.</span></p><p><span>Faluvegi said scammers often begin with cold outreach and build a close personal rapport over time before steering targets toward bogus crypto investments on fake platforms that show inflated returns and demand larger deposits, only to later block withdrawals with made-up charges or technical issues, then disappear.</span></p><p><span>“A common tactic is to let you withdraw small initial 'profits' to encourage you to invest larger sums. And when you attempt to withdraw bigger amounts, they suddenly create obstacles like taxes, fees, or system errors, blocking access to your funds,” he said.</span></p><p><span>In December, San Jose widow Margaret Loke </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/351568/chatgpt-helps-expose-1-million-crypto-pig-butchering-scam" target="_blank"><span>lost nearly $1 million</span></a><span> in a crypto pig-butchering scam she later confirmed was fraud after checking the offer with ChatGPT.</span></p><p><span>The Justice Department last year </span><span>filed to seize </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/325882/justice-dept-seize-record-225-million-pig-butchering-crypto-scams" target="_blank"><span>$225 million</span></a><span> in Tether's </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-tether-usdt-stablecoin" target="_blank"><span>USDT</span></a> <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/stablecoins" target="_blank"><span>stablecoin</span></a><span>, the largest crypto forfeiture ever tied to pig butchering fraud, after tracing funds laundered through the OKX exchange.</span></p><p><a href="https://decrypt.co/350295/interpol-scam-compound-network-global-threat-crypto-fraud" target="_blank"><span>Sprawling scam compounds</span></a><span> in Myanmar and Cambodia, run by Chinese organized crime networks and often staffed by trafficked laborers, have turned pig-butchering into a multibillion-dollar global enterprise, with stolen crypto quickly laundered through specialized channels into shell accounts and luxury assets across Southeast Asian financial hubs before the trail goes cold.</span></p><p><span>The DOJ has moved to </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/350719/justice-department-seizes-domain-burma-based-crypto-scam-compound" target="_blank"><span>shut down domains</span></a><span> linked to a major compound in Myanmar, while </span><span>Chinese authorities</span><a href="https://decrypt.co/356338/china-executes-eleven-members-of-crime-family-linked-to-myanmar-scam-hubs" target="_blank"><span> sentenced</span></a><span> multiple Myanmar compound kingpins to death for operations tied to over $1.4 billion in fraud and at least 14 deaths.</span></p><p><span>“Always research any trading platform thoroughly before investing. Check for licensing, regulation, and independent reviews, and never solely rely on what the platform or its ‘users’ claim,” Faluvegi warned.</span></p><div><h3>Daily Debrief Newsletter</h3><p>Start every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.</p></div></div></div>

<li>the unreliable butterfly keyboard that plagued Apple laptops for years</li> <li>underpowered Intel Core M processor</li> <li>single USB-C port (that was also for charging)</li> <li>poor battery life compared to MacBook Air</li>
</ul> <p>And all of these issues came with a premium $1,299 price tag that exceeded the MacBook Air at the time.</p> <p>The MacBook was, by all appearances, supposed to be the successor to the MacBook Air. But ultimately, despite being beloved by some, most users rejected the MacBook in favor of the “old” MacBook Air.</p> <h2>Why Apple’s new ‘MacBook’ will be different</h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/06/What-can-we-expect-from-Apples-rumored-new-MacBook-with-an-iPhone-processor.webp" alt="What can we expect from Apple's rumored new MacBook, with an iPhone processor? | Renders of colorful MacBooks shown"></figure> <p>The upcoming revival of the MacBook <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/09/apples-new-macbook-is-coming-heres-every-rumored-feature/">sounds like</a> it has a very different goal for Apple.</p> <p>Rather than being “the future of the notebook,” Apple is instead making the Mac more accessible. The likely target customer is an iPhone user with a PC, Chromebook, or no personal computer at all.</p> <p>But thanks to lessons learned, Apple silicon, and technology advancements, this new 12.9-inch MacBook shouldn’t have any of the same flaws as its predecessor.</p> <p>Mac keyboards have been solid since the last butterfly model died off. I don’t expect anything different from the new MacBook.</p> <p>Apple silicon is powerful enough that even an iPhone-class A18 Pro chip should prove more than sufficient for the average user.</p> <p>I suspect the new MacBook will offer at least two USB-C ports, or perhaps one plus a MagSafe charger. In any case, it should be a better situation than last time—in part due to USB-C being far more popular today than it was in 2015.</p> <p>And finally, Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/23/two-expected-iphone-air-weaknesses-now-look-surprisingly-great/">has already proven</a> that it can make ultra-thin devices with surprisingly great battery life. We can thank Apple silicon for that.</p> <p>All of these improvements, plus a price tag rumored to be around $699—several hundred dollars less than the MacBook Air.</p> <p>The new MacBook won’t have the futuristic, premium shine of its predecessor. But based on the latest rumors, it should easily be a better overall computer.</p> <p>Are you interested in Apple’s forthcoming new MacBook? Why or why not?

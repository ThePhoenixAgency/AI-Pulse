<h2>New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Performance expectations</h2> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/16inch-m4-macbook-pro-front.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="16-inch MacBook Pro"></figure><p>Foundry</p></div> <p>The Pro and Max variants of Apple’s chips are aimed at professionals whose workflows require sustained high performance that exceeds the capabilities of the standard M5 chips. These higher-end variants push the boundaries of Apple Silicon by scaling up core counts and memory interfaces and offer a more advanced architecture with greater flexibility for CPU, GPU, and memory configurations. These models also include additional ports, like Thunderbolt 5, that aren’t yet supported at the entry-level.</p> <p>While the standard M5 MacBook Pro that debuted in October 2025 was little more than a chip refresh to the consumer-targeted version of the machine, the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are expected to deliver significant performance leaps to the MacBook Pro, particularly in graphics and artificial intelligence.</p> <p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2508939/major-changes-are-coming-to-the-macbook-pro-but-not-until-2026.html">Reports</a> indicate that we can expect a typical performance boost from one chip generation to another – between 15 and 25 percent over the equivalent M4 chips. However, based on the performance gains observed in the base M5 chip – which saw a 13% increase in single-core and a 22% increase in multi-core performance over the M4 – projections for the M5 Pro and Max are optimistic. The M5 Max is expected to be a “AI monster,” potentially <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3030240/m5-pro-max-macbook-pro-performance-speed-graphics-configurations.html">cracking the 250,000-point mark in Geekbench 6 GPU</a> compute tests, a feat previously only approached by the M3 Ultra with double the GPU cores. </p>
</div> <div>
<h3>M5 Pro and M5 Max chips: Rumored features and specifications</h3> <ul>
<li>New chip design for the M5 Pro and M5 Max could feature the CPU and GPU on separate blocks.</li>
</ul> <p>The M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are expected to be substantial upgrades over the M4 Pro and M4 Max. Current reports suggest Apple may maintain similar core counts to the M4 generation while focusing on architectural efficiency improvements and higher clock speeds. Although exact specifications have not been confirmed, both chips are expected to scale well beyond the base M5’s 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU configuration. </p> <p>More notably, the M5 Pro and M5 Max are rumored to introduce a major architectural shift aimed at improving AI and parallel processing performance. In October 2025, MaxTech’s Vadim Yuryev <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://x.com/VadimYuryev/status/1975354667396964766&amp;xcust=1-1-2942089-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2942089/macbook-pro-m5-pro-max-release-specs-price.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that Apple is developing a redesigned chip layout that separates the CPU and GPU into distinct blocks. </p> <p>This modular approach could enable more flexible CPU and GPU configurations — for example, pairing a base CPU configuration with a fully enabled GPU. Yuryev suggested that this architectural overhaul is the reason the M5 Pro and M5 Max may be delayed until 2026.</p> <p>The high-end models are also rumored to use TSMC’s “SoIC-MH” packaging technology, which allows vertical stacking of semiconductor components. This approach is expected to improve thermal efficiency and performance compared to the standard 3nm process used in the base M5. These chips are expected to debut in 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with dual-fan cooling systems, offering better sustained performance under heavy workloads compared to the single-fan base M5 configuration.</p> <p>At a glance: </p> <ul>
<li><strong>Process Technology</strong>: Built on TSMC’s third-generation 3nm process (N3P), delivering roughly 10% better efficiency and 5% higher performance compared to the M4 series.</li> <li><strong>Memory Bandwidth</strong> <strong>&amp; Capacity</strong>: Expected to deliver nearly a 30% increase in memory bandwidth (around 153 GB/s on the base M5), with the Pro and Max scaling even further for higher throughput.
<ul>
<li>M5 Pro: At least 48GB RAM</li> <li>M5 Max: Up to 128GB+ RAM. The Max variant is also expected to remain the only option supporting up to 8TB of storage. </li>
</ul>
</li> <li><strong>GPU Capabilities &amp; AI Performance</strong>: Expected improvements include: <ul>
<li>Third-generation hardware-accelerated ray tracing.</li> <li>Second-generation dynamic caching.</li> <li>A rumored “Neural Accelerator” in each GPU core (separate from the standard Neural Engine). </li> <li>Together, these upgrades could enable up to a 4x increase in GPU-based AI workload performance, with the Pro and Max variants further scaling graphics and AI capabilities for demanding professional applications.</li>
</ul>
</li> <li><strong>Connectivity</strong>: Confirmed support for Thunderbolt 5, offering up to 120Gbps for video and 80Gbps for data transfer.</li> <li><strong>Architecture and Design:</strong> Reports suggest higher-end models will separate CPU and GPU blocks, enabling more flexible configurations (e.g., base CPU paired with a max-tier GPU). The architecture is expected to share core design elements with the A19 Pro, improving scalability for professional and AI-heavy workloads.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <ul>
<li>N1 chip: Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6. </li> <li>Thunderbolt 5.</li>
</ul> <p>With the launch of the M4 MacBook Pro, Apple made a series of upgrades that replaced outdated components, including upping the base RAM to 16GB, bringing Thunderbolt 5 to the M4 Pro and Max models, and offering a Nano-texture glass option. The M5 MacBook Pro saw no changes to the specs other than the processor. The Bluetooth and Wi-Fi remained the same. A new 4TB SSD option was added, but in the U.K. and Europe, Apple has removed the Power Adapter from the box.</p> <p>However, more is expected for the MacBook Pro M5 Pro and Max: Apple may integrate the N1 chip, as used in the iPhone 17, which will bring Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, as well as improve features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MacBook-Pro-ports.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" alt="Apple MacBook Pro ports"></figure><p>Apple</p></div> <p>The entry-level model still only offers Thunderbolt 4, but the Max and Pro will continue to offer Thunderbolt 5. </p> <p>There are reports that Apple is working on a <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2550395/the-macbook-with-a-modem-dream-may-finally-come-true.html">5G modem for the Mac</a>, but it’s unlikely to arrive before 2026.</p>
</div> <div>
<h2>New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Camera</h2> <ul>
<li>No change expected.</li>
</ul> <p>The M4 MacBook Pro added a 12MP FaceTime camera, a decent upgrade from the 1080p FaceTime camera. The M5 Macook Pro maintains this camera, so it is unlikely the Pro and Max models will gain anything. </p> <p>However, we could see a similar FaceTime camera update to 18MP as seen on the iPhone 17. The square sensor is less relevant here as the MacBook Pro will only ever be in one orientation, although it could allow for more of the area around a person to be visible.</p> <p>More changes are rumored for the camera in the M6 generation: reports suggest that in the future we may see a <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2944619/apples-touchscreen-macbook-pro-is-reportedly-coming-next-year-without-a-notch.html">hole-punch webcam</a> instead of a notch.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Macbook-Pro-M5_5379.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="Macbook Pro M5 5379"></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>
</div> <div>
<h2>New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Design rumors</h2> <ul>
<li>No change to the design expected.</li>
</ul> <p>Apple last updated the design of the MacBook Pro in 2021. There was no change to the MacBook Pro’s design when Apple introduced the M5 model. Apple will likely stick with the current design for the M5 Pro and Max models. It’s always possible that a new color makes an appearance—like Space Black in 2023—but for the most part, the MacBook Pro design is set for at least another year.</p> <p>There have been suggestions that an overhaul of the MacBook design could mark the 20th anniversary of the MacBook Pro (the MacBook Pro launched in January 2006 replacing the PowerBook). However, the rumors aren’t pointing to an early 2026 redesign.</p> <p>Instead, the bigger changes are expected for the M6 generation. In July 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the M5 MacBook Pro series would be the last of the current design. Apple appears to be saving the next major design upgrade for the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2931833/touchscreen-macbook-pro-m6-design-processor-specs-release.html">M6 MacBook Pro</a> for 2026. The M6 upgrade is said to include <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2348163/ipad-pro-oled-display-macbook-2026.html">OLED screens</a>, a camera “hole” to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2550737/report-the-oled-macbook-pro-will-dump-the-notch-for-a-camera-hole.html">replace the notch</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2508939/major-changes-are-coming-to-the-macbook-pro-but-not-until-2026.html">thinner design</a>.</p> <h2>New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Display rumors</h2> <ul>
<li>No changes to the display expected.</li> <li>Big changes are said to be coming to the M6 MacBook Pro.</li>
</ul> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-left-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="space black macbook pro"></figure><p>Foundry</p></div> <p>There is no change to the display on the M5 MacBook Pro, so it’s unlikely that the M5 Max and M5 Pro models will get any screen updates. Although we could see a higher nits brightness rating, up from the current 1,600 nits peak. </p> <p>As for display support, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips will continue to differentiate themselves from the base M5 through superior expansion and display support. While the standard M5 is limited to two external displays, the M5 Pro is expected to support at least two 6K displays, and the M5 Max will likely support up to four external displays</p> <p>More changes to the display could be in the pipeline, but not for this generation. Back on February 11, 2025, The Elec reported that OLED displays for the MacBook Pro were going into production, but these weren’t expected to feature in the laptop until 2026. Unfortunately, the big display changes seem set to arrive with a subsequent generation of MacBook Pro, with rumors, again, pointing to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2871469/the-2026-macbook-pro-again-rumored-to-get-a-major-display-upgrade.html">Apple introducing OLED screens</a> for the M6 generation of MacBook Pro.</p> <p>There could be something even more exciting coming with the M6 generation: a touchscreen! Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple is going to launch a MacBook with a touch screen, and it could arrive on a MacBook Pro as soon as 2026. However, this update is not expected to arrive until the M6 generation and could be delayed until 2027.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/M4-MacBook-Pros.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="M4 MacBook Pros"><figcaption><p>Apple could be saving any drastic changes to the MacBook Pro for 2026.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>

<h2>New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Release date</h2> <ul>
<li>Launch by March 4, 2026</li>
</ul> <p>Apple is expected to release the updated MacBook Pro models featuring M5 Pro and M5 Max chips in the&nbsp;<strong>spring of 2026</strong>. </p> <p>Apple has confirmed it will hold a series of global “experiences” on March 4, 2026, in New York, London, and Shanghai. Unlike a traditional keynote event, these coordinated sessions are expected to be extended hands-on experiences for the press to interact with new hardware, and the M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro is likely to be one of the new products being demoed at that “experience”. </p> <p>Specific details regarding the launch include:</p> <ul>
<li><strong>Experience day</strong>: Apple has invited some press to “experiences” on <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html">March 4</a>, in London, New York and Shanghai. </li> <li><strong>Production status</strong>: Reports from early 2025 indicated that fabrication facilities for these “high-end M5 models” were already being prepared, utilizing TSMC’s advanced SoIC-MH process for improved thermal management.</li>
</ul> <p>In December 2025, a MacRumors <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/apple-developing-imac-with-m5-max/&amp;xcust=1-1-2942089-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2942089/macbook-pro-m5-pro-max-release-specs-price.html" target="_blank">report</a> indicated that a kernel debug kit used by Apple engineers referenced MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, indicating that the update is coming soon.</p> <p>On February 1, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold&amp;xcust=1-1-2942089-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2942089/macbook-pro-m5-pro-max-release-specs-price.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that Apple plans to ship the M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro around the time when macOS 26.3 is released. That version is currently in beta and could be released in February or March.</p> <p>On February 4, Apple released the release candidate for macOS 26.3. This indicates that the software is almost ready to go and could be officially released in the next week or two. The new laptops could follow shortly after or be released at the same time.</p> <p>On February 9, Gurman <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk&amp;xcust=1-1-2942089-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2942089/macbook-pro-m5-pro-max-release-specs-price.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that the macOS 26.3 beta release candidate cycle runs through March. A release of the new laptops “is currently slated for as early as the week of March 2.”</p> <p>On February 22, Gurman indicated that Apple will launch “at least five new products” by March 4, and that could include the M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro. </p> <h3>Why the Delay?</h3> <p>The staggered release – launching the base M5 in late 2025 while holding back the Pro and Max versions – is reportedly due to a significant architectural shift. As discussed above, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are rumored to feature a new design that separates CPU and GPU blocks, which may allow for greater customization at the time of purchase to meet the parallel processing demands of AI. </p>
</div> <div>
<h2>New M5 MacBook Pro: Price</h2> <ul>
<li>Prices are unlikely to change.</li>
</ul> <p>Reports suggest pricing for M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pros will align with the current Pro and Max models.</p> <p>Here are the prices for the current standard configurations of the M4 Pro and Max MacBook Pro, for reference. Prices are unlikely to change.</p> <h3>14-inch MacBook Pro</h3> <ul>

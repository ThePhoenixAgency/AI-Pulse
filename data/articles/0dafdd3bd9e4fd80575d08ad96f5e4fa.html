    <pre><code>In brief
Trump Media's Truth Social Funds applied for two new crypto ETFs centered on Cronos, Ethereum, and Bitcoin. The joint Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF will split exposure to the top assets via an expected 60-40 split in favor of BTC. Shares in DJT finished the day up around 0.8%, but are down nearly 39% in the last six months. Truth Social Funds, the “America first” exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuer from Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), filed Friday to launch two new ETFs centered on the performance of Cronos (CRO), Bitcoin, and Ethereum.&nbsp;The registrations for the Truth Social Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF and Truth Social Bitcoin and Ether ETF are created in partnership with Crypto.com, which would serve as the digital asset custodian and staking services provider for the products."We are pleased to be selected to provide digital asset custody, liquidity, and staking services for these new Truth Social Funds ETFs," said Crypto.com co-founder and CEO Kris Marszalek, in a statement. "These two digital asset ETFs have a strong value proposition that Crypto.com is supportive of and look forward to providing traders access to."The Cronos ETF is designed to track the performance of CRO—the token of the Crypto.com-linked Cronos blockchain—while providing exposure to native staking and liquid staking of the Cronos token.On the other hand, the Bitcoin and Ether ETF is a joint ETF, designed to track the performance of the top two crypto assets by market cap using approximately a 60-40 BTC-ETH split. Like its Cronos ETF, Truth Social Funds intends to provide staking rewards from its Ether position to ETF holders.&nbsp;The applications are just the latest crypto ETF filings from Trump Media entities, which previously filed for a solo Bitcoin ETF last June and a crypto blue chip ETF which includes BTC and ETH as well as Solana (SOL), the Ripple-linked XRP, and CRO.Those ETFs are expected to go live sometime in the next few months, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.&nbsp;The firm’s current ETFs are “America first” by design and include a red state real estate ETF, an American security and defense fund, and an "American Icons" ETF that includes shares of firms like Walmart, McDonald’s, and Home Depot.&nbsp;Both of the newly registered funds will be advised by Yorkville America Equities, an investment adviser focused on America-first investments.&nbsp;Shares in Trump Media, the firm behind the Truth Social platform, closed up around 0.9% on Friday, changing hands at $10.98. Shares have fallen nearly 39% in the last six months.Daily Debrief NewsletterStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.</code></pre>

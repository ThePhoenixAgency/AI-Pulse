Devices like the ASUS ROG Ally series and the Lenovo Legion Go series were at the forefront. While the allure of handhelds lies in the fact that you can carry them anywhere, it is still an extra gadget to carry in your backpack, and not to mention the screen size that’s half that of a typical gaming laptop.</p>
<p>Enter the <strong>Legion Go Fold Concept</strong>, which is a traditional handheld when folded, a full-blown desktop when unfolded, and a large-screen handheld when unfolded with controllers attached on both ends. This may sound too good to be true, but the Legion Go Fold Concept will be announced by Lenovo at <strong>MWC in Barcelona on March 2nd, 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s a concept device. But judging by Lenovo’s track record, especially with devices like the ThinkBook Auto Twist Concept 2-in-1, which took just a year to be launched in the market as the <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/12/24/exclusive-this-is-lenovos-thinkpad-lineup-for-2026-including-thinkbook-plus-with-rotatable-display-and-thinkcentre-x-aio/">ThinkBook Plus Gen 7 Auto Twist</a>, the Legion Go Fold Concept may also get a similar treatment.</p>
<h2>Lenovo’s foldable gaming handheld concept can also function as a desktop</h2>
<p>Foldable displays are anything but rare these days, with devices like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 already selling like hot cakes. As expected, the Legion Go Fold Concept’s party trick isn’t that it has a foldable <strong>POLED display</strong> that goes from <strong>7.7” to 11.6”</strong>, but that it can be used in several modes:</p>
<p>The first is the standard <strong>Handheld Mode</strong>, where the tablet, in folded form with its 7.7” display, will have wireless controllers attached on either side, making it look like a traditional handheld.</p>
<p>The second is an unconventional vertical <strong>Split-Screen Mode</strong>, where the screen can be unfolded upright so that one half of the display can be used for gaming, while the other can be used for streaming or watching gameplay.</p>
<p>The third mode takes handheld gaming to a whole new level with a <strong>Horizon Full Screen Mode</strong>, where the display can be unfolded horizontally, and the wireless gaming controllers can be attached on either side, giving gamers an 11.6” screen real estate in a handheld gaming form factor.</p>

<p>Last, and most importantly, the Lenovo Legion Go Fold Concept also has an <strong>Expanded Desktop Mode</strong>, which allows the device to be docked with an included wireless keyboard that also has a touchpad, making it look and feel like a traditional clamshell laptop. You also wouldn’t need a separate mouse, as the right-side game controller can double up as a vertical mouse, as we saw in the Legion Go Gen 2.</p>

<p>This way, Lenovo has designed a proof of concept that works for gamers who want a large screen gaming experience but do not have the time to use a TV or PC. Also, users wouldn’t need to have a laptop for work and a handheld for gaming, as the Legion Go Fold Concept is capable of both these tasks.</p>
<h2>Specifications of the Lenovo Legion Go Fold Concept</h2>
<p>The Legion Go Fold Concept is well equipped in the performance side of things as well, being powered by an <strong>Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor</strong>. The lack of the newer Panther Lake chips is certainly disappointing, but note that this is a concept device, and its development might have started off with last generation processors from Intel.</p>
<p>Windows Handhelds are traditionally notorious when it comes to battery life, and the modest <strong>48Wh battery</strong> may find it hard to sustain longer gaming sessions. Hopefully, the new gaming improvements coming to Windows 11 in 2026, along with the Xbox FSE, may soften the blow a bit.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lenovo has graciously added <strong>32GB of RAM</strong>, which could help with both gaming and multitasking. The Legion Go Fold Concept also has an FPS Mode where the right controller can be used as a vertical mouse, and it also houses a small screen that doubles as a touchpad and a display with performance metrics, other settings, and a customizable hotkey.</p>

<p>For now, the Legion Go Fold Concept remains exactly what Lenovo calls it. A concept. We have no confirmation on whether or when it will reach the market, and final hardware could change significantly if it ever becomes a commercial product. Still, with gaming hardware evolving in increasingly unconventional ways, devices like this show where PC gaming could be headed.</p>
<p>And if concepts like this do become real, Microsoft will need to follow through on its promise to improve Windows 11 performance and efficiency for gaming so the software can keep pace with the creativity happening on the hardware side.</p> </div></div>

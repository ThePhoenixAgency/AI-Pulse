The update lets you move between audio and video instantly, while downloads now include full video playback for offline viewing, so a commute or flight will not interrupt the show.</p> <p>The system relies on HTTP Live Streaming, which adjusts video quality based on network speed, meaning playback continues smoothly on Wi-Fi or cellular without manual settings. Apple also ties video episodes into recommendations and category discovery, so the same feed that suggests audio shows will now surface watchable content as well.</p> <p>Apple confirmed the feature in its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2026/02/apple-introduces-a-new-video-podcast-experience-on-apple-podcasts/">announcement</a>, describing it as a milestone in podcast evolution.</p> <p><em>“Twenty years ago, Apple helped take podcasting mainstream by adding podcasts to iTunes, and more than a decade ago, we introduced the dedicated Apple Podcasts app,” </em>said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services. <em>“By bringing a category-leading video experience to Apple Podcasts, we’re putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts.”</em></p> <h2>Watching and listening stay connected</h2> <p>The new experience focuses on continuity instead of separation between formats. You can start an episode as video, lock the phone, and continue as audio without restarting playback, and downloaded video behaves the same way when offline. HLS streaming handles automatic quality changes so the transition happens without buffering interruptions.</p> <p>The update also arrives as video podcasts grow across platforms, and Apple aims to keep listeners inside the same ecosystem instead of pushing them toward video-first services.</p> <h2>New revenue options for creators</h2> <figure><img src="https://www.macobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Apple-Podcasts-gains-full-video-playback-in-iOS-26.4-creators-get-new-ad-tools-1-1024x576.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>The bigger shift affects creators. Podcast hosts can distribute video through supported hosting providers and ad networks, including Acast, ART19, Omny Studio, and SiriusXM brands. They keep ownership of content and monetization while gaining access to dynamic video advertising.</p> <p>Apple enables dynamically inserted video ads for the first time, including host-read sponsorship segments. Ads insert into episodes without altering downloads or breaking subscriber feeds, and networks pay Apple an impression-based delivery fee while creators avoid distribution charges.</p> <p>The company says the video format integrates directly into existing shows rather than forcing creators to launch separate feeds. That approach allows audiences to follow the same podcast whether they prefer watching or listening.</p> <p>The feature is available in the developer beta of iOS 26.4, iPadOS 26.4, and visionOS 26.4, with a public release planned for spring. The video podcast system also works on iPhone, iPad, Apple Vision Pro, and the web, expanding Apple Podcasts beyond its traditional audio role into a full viewing platform.</p> </div> </section> </div></div>

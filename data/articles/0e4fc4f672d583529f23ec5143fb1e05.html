Apple is marking Lunar Year 2026, also known as the Year of the Horse, with custom wallpapers for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. Aditya Tiwari Neowin @TheLazyAvenger · Feb 16, 2026 01:40 EST If you are looking for some new wallpapers for your Apple device, the Cupertino giant published its custom official wallpapers for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac a while ago. The company is celebrating the Chinese Lunar Year 2026, which is also known as the Year of the Horse. Now is the right time to download and decorate your devices with these wallpapers, as the Year of the Horse in the Chinese zodiac begins on February 17, 2026, and lasts through February 5, 2027. Apple's latest Lunar Year 2026 wallpapers are available on the Apple Store website. You can click on the following links to download them for your device: Year of the Horse wallpaper for iPhone Year of the Horse wallpaper for iPad Year of the Horse wallpaper for Mac Year of the Horse wallpaper for Apple Watch After downloading the image on your iPad or iPad, go to Settings &gt; Wallpaper &gt; Add New Wallpaper. Tap Photos, then select the wallpaper from the image grid. On your Mac, right-click on the image file and choose "Set Desktop Picture" from the drop-down menu. For the Apple Watch, you can use the Watch app on your iPhone to transfer the image. All of these wallpapers are high-quality and optimized for your Apple device's aspect ratio. The Mac wallpaper is 12032 x 6768 pixels to ensure it looks crisp on the Pro Display XDR. Meanwhile, the iPad version is available in landscape orientation. Apple says that the Year of the Horse symbolizes "strength and ambition." A separate Year of the Horse wallpaper for iPhone is available for download here. Last month, the company also launched a limited-edition AirPods Pro 3 to celebrate the Lunar New Year, available in China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Malaysia. Time and again, Apple bakes custom wallpapers for its devices to celebrate various occasions and major updates. In January, Apple released its annual wallpaper update to honor Black History Month. The company also stuffed new wallpapers in its recently released iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 update for iPhone and iPad.</p></div>

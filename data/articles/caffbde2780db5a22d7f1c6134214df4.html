and Andrew Beck, Claremont’s vice-president for communications and an admitted SACR member.</p><p>Current and former employees of Beck-founded agency Beck &amp; Stone are also among the donors.</p><p>John Bellamy Foster, professor of sociology at the University of Oregon, said:“Jace Yarbrough is among the most militant figures in the Maga political movement in the United States, and a major recipient of Maga-billionaire donations in his run for a congressional seat in North Texas.”</p><p>Foster added: “If it can be said that there is a neofascist political movement in the United States, Yarbrough is certainly one of its chief would-be ‘lawgivers’.”</p><figure></figure></article><article><header><h2>Rubio to meet UK foreign minister amid tensions over joint air base</h2></header><p><strong>Secretary of state Marco Rubio will meet with Britain’s foreign minister Yvette Cooper today</strong>, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> renewed his criticism of London for ceding sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, which is home to a US-UK air base.</p><p>Last year British prime minister Keir Starmer agreed a deal to transfer sovereignty of the Indian Ocean islands to Mauritius, while keeping control of one - Diego Garcia - through a 99-year lease that preserved US operations at the base.</p><p>Washington last year gave its blessing to the agreement, but Trump has since changed his mind several times. In January, Trump described it as an act of “great stupidity“, but earlier this month said he understood the deal was the best Starmer could make, before then renewing his criticism this week.</p><p>The Diego Garcia base has recently been used for operations in the Middle East against Yemen’s Houthis and in humanitarian aid to Gaza.</p><p>Although on Tuesday Rubio’s State Department said it backed the Chagos accord, the next day Trump said Britain was making a big mistake.</p><p>“DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, saying the base could be called upon in any future military operation to “eradicate a potential attack” from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>.</p><p>Under the conditions for using the joint base, Britain would need to agree in advance to any operations out of Diego Garcia.</p><figure><div><img alt="Diego Garcia, largest island of the Chagos Archipelago and a militarized atoll by the United Kingdom." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25da67ef346aade32610145326aa94c0163499aa/0_0_3581_2632/master/3581.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Diego Garcia, largest island of the Chagos Archipelago and a militarized atoll by the United Kingdom.</span> Photograph: NASA Archive/Alamy</figcaption></figure></article><article><header><h2>Second carrier strike group heads for region as US weighs up early attack</h2><div><p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Dan-Sabbagh,-L.png?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=cec99c5da174842615d73509b87e8008" alt="Dan Sabbagh"></p><p><span>Dan Sabbagh</span></p></div></header><p><strong>Experts say there are already sufficient US military assets in the Middle East to begin an aerial bombing campaign against Iran</strong>, potentially in conjunction with Israel, though it is less clear what this would achieve.</p><p>The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and other warships in a strike group have been in the Arabian Sea for nearly a month, with nine squadrons of aircraft including F-35 Lightning IIs and F/A-18 Super Hornets.</p><p>A second carrier strike group, led by the USS Gerald R Ford, was last confirmed to be in the Atlantic west of Morocco on Tuesday.

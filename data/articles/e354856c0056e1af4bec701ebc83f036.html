<h2><span>Philips OLED910: Two-minute review </span></h2><p>The Philips OLED910 is one of Philips’ two flagship <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/oled">OLED</a> TVs from its latest line-up — and yet it's price more like the mid-range options among the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/the-best-oled-tvs">best OLED TVs</a>. Following in the footsteps of its excellent predecessor, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/philips-oled909-review">Philips OLED909</a>, the OLED910 delivers flagship OLED performance and features but priced at £1,799 for the 65-inch model I tested, it’s cheaper than all of its high-end competitors.</p><p>The picture quality of the OLED910 is outstanding. Colours are vibrant but also look accurate, textures are crisp, detail is refined, and contrast is powerful and dynamic throughout viewing. It also has strong motion handling, though this does require some setup. Combining all this with Ambilight makes for an excellent home viewing experience that’s up there with the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-tv">best TVs</a>.</p><p>A rarity in TV, the OLED910 also has an excellent built-in sound system, developed with Bowers &amp; Wilkins. With an external speaker array under the screen to house centre, left and right speakers, the OLED910 delivers impactful, clear and engaging audio. It also has a wide soundstage with pinpoint accuracy. While Dolby Atmos effects are more muted, they are still present. While you could add one of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/soundbars/the-best-soundbars-for-all-budgets">best soundbars</a>, it’s not a necessity here.</p><p>Ambilight is the highlight of the OLED910’s design, as is usual with Philips TVs. Projecting coloured light onto the wall behind the TV to extend the impact of what's on-screen, Ambilight is versatile and not just useful for movies. Elsewhere, the OLED910 is well built and while its feet design mean placing a soundbar isn’t easy, it’s still a suitably premium TV, with an excellently designed remote supplied.</p><p>The OLED910 can just about hang with the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-gaming-tv">best gaming TVs</a>, supporting <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/4k">4K</a> 144Hz, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/amd">AMD</a> FreeSync Premium Pro, G-Sync and HGiG, Dolby Vision gaming and ALLM, while registering a respectable 12.6ms input lag time. Paired with excellent picture quality and razor sharp performance, the OLED910 is brilliant for gaming in principle — it's just a shame that only two of its four ports support HDMI 2.1.</p><p>Where the OLED910 pulls off a real magic trick is in its price. At £1,799 for the 65-inch model I tested, it’s cheaper than the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/lg-g5-review">LG G5</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/samsung-s95f-review">Samsung S95F</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/panasonic-z95b-review">Panasonic Z95B</a>, while still delivering the picture quality and performance to compete. If you’re looking for a flagship OLED TV, the OLED910 is the best value for money on the market.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/huf7xQu3sacyCi8HfDkxKP.jpg" alt="Philips OLED910 with snow covered fence on screen">

It’s available in 65 and 77-inch sizes in the UK, as well as 55-inch in some other regions. At launch, the 65-inch model (the size I’m testing) cost £2,199, while the 77-inch model cost £3,399.</p><p>Since its release, prices have dropped. The 65-inch costs £1,799, which makes it cheaper than other flagship OLED rivals such as the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/lg-g5-review">LG G5</a> (£2,099), <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/samsung-s95f-review">Samsung S95F</a> (£2,199), <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/sony-bravia-8-ii-review">Sony Bravia 8 II</a> (£2,199) and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/panasonic-z95b-review">Panasonic Z95B</a> (£2,199).

</p></div><figcaption><span>The Philips OLED910 comes with four HDMI ports, but only two are HDMI 2.1 (pictured). </span><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>Philips OLED910 review: Features</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Primary Tandem RGB OLED panel </strong></li><li><strong>Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support</strong></li><li><strong>Four-sided Ambilight </strong></li></ul><p>The Philips OLED910 uses a Primary RGB Tandem OLED panel, the same found in the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/lg">LG</a> G5, and comes equipped with Philips’ latest P5 Gen 9 AI processor, which utilizes new AI Adaptive features for optional optimization of picture quality. The Philips OLED910 supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ HDR formats, both of which can be found on 4K Blu-ray and 4K content on some of the best streaming services.</p><p>For audio, the OLED910 uses a 3.1 channel, 80W speaker system tuned by Bowers &amp; Wilkins. It supports both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X enhanced sound formats. There are a number of different sound modes available, including an AI Mode.</p><p>The OLED910’s unique design feature compared to the competition is its built-in Ambilight. Rows of LEDs on all sides project coloured light onto the wall behind, either matching the video, or reacting to audio, or as a single colour choice. The OLED910 features four-sided Intelligence 3.0 Ambilight, which uses sensors to adapt the Ambilight to viewing conditions, such as brightening in well-lit rooms. This can be adjusted in the Ambilight settings.</p><p>The OLED910 supports a good number of gaming features. It supports 4K 144Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/nvidia">Nvidia</a> G-Sync, HGiG, ALLM and Dolby Vision gaming, but only on two HDMI 2.1 ports: odd when the step-down Philips OLED760 has four. It also has its own game menu where settings such as Shadow Enhancer and Colour Filter can be adjusted.</p><p>Using <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/google">Google</a> TV as its smart TV platform, the OLED910 supports all major streaming services such as Netflix, Disney Plus, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> TV Plus and Prime Video, and there’s support for some UK-based apps including ITVX and Channel 4. There is, however, no built-in app support for BBC iPlayer – you'd need a streaming stick for that.</p><ul><li><strong>Features score: 4.5 / 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>Philips OLED910 review: Picture quality</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qRsxVw6kxFgWTnNCURiQyQ.jpg" alt="Philips OLED910 with orange butterfly on screen">
</p></div><figcaption><span>The Philips OLED910 delivers rich, accurate colours </span><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Bold yet accurate colours</strong></li><li><strong>The brightest OLED TV I've tested, with excellent contrast</strong></li><li><strong>Motion requires some setup</strong></li></ul><p>Starting with brightness measurements, the OLED910 hit 2,329 nits HDR peak brightness in Filmmaker Mode, making it the brightest OLED TV I’ve tested in default settings. The OLED910 didn’t have a Standard mode, so I used Personal instead, and this hit 1,565 nits HDR peak. This was with 'Peak light' in 'Brightness' settings set to Medium (the default) but changing this to Maximum (the default for Filmmaker), it registered 2,415 nits HDR peak brightness.</p><p>For fullscreen HDR brightness, the OLED910 hit 406 nits peak brightness in Filmmaker Mode, again the brightest I’ve tested, surpassing the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/samsung">Samsung</a> S95F’s 390 nits.</p><p>Colours were one of the OLED910’s strongest areas. During the market scene in <em>The Sound of Music</em> on 4K Blu-ray, the various fruits and vegetables, as well as a bouquet of pink flowers, all exploded on screen with a real vibrancy. The same was true for <em>Edward Scissorhands</em>, also on 4K Blu-ray, as the OLED910 accurately delivered the garish, vivid greens, pinks and yellows of the gaudy neighbourhood houses.</p><p>It’s no surprise the OLED910 demonstrated such excellent colours, as it measured a 99.9% coverage of the DCI-P3 colour space, and 81.6% of the BT.2020 colour space. These are superb results that easily compete with its fellow flagship rivals.</p><p>Of course, colourful scenes were aided by the OLED910’s fantastic Ambilight feature, which projects colours from on screen to the wall behind. In pitch black conditions, Ambilight really does add an extra layer that made movies like <em>Elemental</em>, viewed on Disney Plus, explode from the screen.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bm5xHoJCk2BCPVPJLV7CMQ.jpg" alt="Philips OLED910 with a scene from The Batman on screen">
</p></div><figcaption><span>The Philips OLED910 delivers powerful contrast, perfect for movies such as <em>The Batman</em> (pictured) </span><span>(Image credit: Warner Bros. / Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Contrast and black levels were also excellent on the OLED910 — and Ambilight boosts perceived contrast further, making it even more impressive. A 4K Blu-ray of <em>The Batman</em> demonstrates the OLED910’s powerful contrast, with a great balance between the dim walls and dark floors and the wall lamps in both the subway scene and the crime scene at Mayor Mitchell’s house.</p><p>In <em>Dark City</em>, the OLED910 delivered truly inky blacks with superb deep shadow detail, never losing any clarity in darker areas on screen, such as the pitch black coats of the 'Strangers'. Large shadows cast onto character’s faces in <em>Dark City</em> also showed off the OLED910’s contrast abilities.</p><p>Textures felt refined throughout viewing, looking both accurate and detailed without ever appearing too sharp. Close-up shots of people’s faces, particularly in <em>The Sound of Music</em> really showed off the OLED910’s authenticity with skin and features such as hair.</p><p>I also tested <em>The Amazing Spider-Man </em>on DVD to see how the OLED910 fared with upscaling. While it did a good job of adding brightness, cleaning up textures and improving colours, it didn’t quite hit the levels of the LG G5, which <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/flagship-oled-tv-showdown-viewers-saw-lg-samsung-sony-and-panasonic-tvs-in-a-blind-test-and-chose-their-favorite">won the upscaling test in our four-way OLED showdown</a>.</p><p>Motion was the one area where the OLED910 required some tweaking. Watching <em>No Time To Die</em>, a panning shot of a rocky cliffside showed judder when in the Pure Cinema and Movie motion modes, and with Standard and Smooth it had the soap opera effect. Changing to Personal and setting Blur Reduction to 2 and Smoothness to 4 seemed to be the sweet spot for natural-looking motion without judder.</p><p>I found these motion settings also worked for sports. Watching a football match on Discovery+, these settings meant action was smooth with no ghosting of the ball.</p><p>For the best picture, I suggest Personal mode and setting colour and contrast settings to Basic rather than AI Adaptive for the most natural picture.</p><ul><li><strong>Picture quality score: 5 / 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>Philips OLED910 review: Sound quality</span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QonvJUJUBWhC9xiAwRzE2P.jpg" alt="Philips OLED910 front speaker">
</p></div><figcaption><span>The Philips OLED910 delivers impressive and immersive built-in sound, aided by its front speaker array (pictured) </span><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>3.1 channel, 80W Bowers &amp; Wilkins speaker array</strong></li><li><strong>Punchy, accurate and clear sound </strong></li><li><strong>Surprisingly wide soundstage</strong></li></ul><p>The OLED910 comes equipped with a 3.1 speaker system, totaling 80W of power. It has an external speaker array handling the front three channels, with a subwoofer on the rear panel. There are several different sound presets including Entertainment, Original, and Music, plus an AI sound mode and a Custom sound mode where settings such as bass enhancement can be adjusted.</p><p>In my regular sound testing scene of the Batmobile chase from <em>The Batman</em>, I was suitably impressed. Not only did the OLED910 deliver punchy bass that accurately delivered the rumble of the Batmobile engine, but it sounded tightly controlled in the low frequencies.</p><p>Mapping of sound was accurate and precise, with spraying bullets, swerving cars and blaring car horns going off screen all accurately reproduced. Dialogue was even clear throughout the scene, despite all the action.</p><p>While small and specific Atmos effects such as the rain may not be quite as clear as they would on a Dolby Atmos soundbar, they were still more present than most TVs. This is a TV that simply doesn't require a separate soundbar.</p><ul><li><strong>Sound quality score: 4.5 / 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>Philips OLED910 review: Design </span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TafXTEr2bC5begRq5Ur7WQ.jpg" alt="Philips OLED910 with red flowers on screen and Ambilight on show">
</p></div><figcaption><span>The Philips OLED910's Ambilight is still a sight to behold, and a unique design feature over its rivals </span><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Ambilight adds to viewing experience </strong></li><li><strong>Sleek, premium feeling remote </strong></li><li><strong>Feet are solid, but stick out </strong></li></ul><p>One of the OLED910’s stand-out design features is what makes it unique from other TVs on the market: Ambilight. With fully customizable lighting options, Ambilight adds an extra layer to the viewing experience, whether you want the lights to follow the picture on screen or to project one single color.</p><p>The OLED910 comes with four-sided Ambilight for truly immersive viewing when wall-mounted and it’s easily one of my favorite features on TVs.</p><p>Elsewhere, the OLED910’s external speaker array, which houses the front channels, has a fabric grille that looks premium and does an effective job at hiding something that could be quite unseemly.</p><p>The OLED910 is deeper than other flagship OLED TVs, but it’s worth it to house the Ambilight tech and great sound system. It has a slim enough bezel allowing for the picture to be the focus on screen, and it comes with two grey feet that are sturdy enough, but due to how far they stick out, adding a soundbar in front of the TV may be a little difficult if that's your plan, depending on the depth of your TV bench.</p><p>The OLED910’s supplied remote is one of the best around. It comes in a matte black finish and is made of a burnished metal material that means it’s reassuringly weighty and premium-looking. It also has light up buttons for use in the dark and is USB-C rechargeable. Other TV brands could learn from Philips with remote design.</p><ul><li><strong>Design score: 5 / 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>Philips OLED910 review: Smart TV &amp; menus </span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rHo9Zcp6vJzYCDjyncDVxP.jpg" alt="Philips OLED910 with Google TV home screen on display">

It also comes with Freely built-in, which not only acts as its broadcast TV guide but also allows for live streaming of broadcast TV over Wi-Fi.</p><p>The Google TV home page is serviceable with some good recommendations based on viewing history, but with large banner ads at the top of the screen (if left idle, these ads take up the whole screen) the home screen can appear quite busy. Some of the recommendations lower down the page as well can be irrelevant.</p><p>As for menus and performance, the OLED910 has a good number of picture and audio settings so you can personalise your picture and sound. I found navigating to be easy enough, with most settings in easy to find places but I found it could be occasionally sluggish. As far as smart TV platforms go, Google TV is solid.</p><ul><li><strong>Smart TV &amp; menus score: 4 / 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>Philips OLED910 review: Gaming </span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nDnc6a6XeURDmdTNZ8JADQ.jpg" alt="Philips OLED910 with Battlefield V on screen">

It does only come with two HDMI 2.1 ports however.</p><p>In terms of actual performance, the OLED910 is great for gaming. It has a measured input lag of 12.6ms which is below the 15ms threshold gamers look for and it means gameplay is smooth.</p><p>Playing <em>Battlefield V</em>, I was impressed by how razor-sharp the OLED910’s performance was, with no signs of lag or processing issues in even the most chaotic of gunfights.</p><p>The OLED910’s excellent picture quality translated well to gaming too, with rich contrast, bold colours and refined detail with sharp textures.</p><ul><li><strong>Gaming score: 4.5 / 5</strong></li></ul><h2><span>Philips OLED910 review: Value </span></h2><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gBi2QVpsHhDipbhFVNrXsM.jpg" alt="Philips OLED910 remote">

This puts it cheaper than all of its rivals: the LG G5 (£2,099), the Samsung S95F (£2,299), the Sony Bravia 8 II (£2,299) and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/panasonic">Panasonic</a> Z95B (£2,199).</p><p>It actually puts the OLED910 closer to mid-range models such as the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/lg-c5-oled-tv-review">LG C5 </a>and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/samsung-s90f-review">Samsung S90F</a>. So you’re getting flagship performance and features for more like a mid-range price. And not just any flagship performance – the brightest OLED I've ever measured, including the vital fullscreen brightness.</p><p>While OLED is still a pricey technology, the OLED910 is actually a bargain given its performance, picture quality and build quality.

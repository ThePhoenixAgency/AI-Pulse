Cumulatively, the four major platforms saw a total decline of about 75 million ETH, while other platforms accounted for the remaining five million ETH, confirming that the phenomenon is widespread and not limited to a single exchange.</p><p>This suggests that leverage traders are “reducing their exposure rather than opening new positions,” CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/698ebd1ac876a02133a03f78-Ethereum-Open-Interest-Drops-Over-80M-ETH-Across-Major-Exchanges" target="_blank">said</a> in a Quicktake analysis.</p><p>This significant drop in OI amid dropping prices can be “viewed as a clean-up of weaker positions, thereby reducing the likelihood of sharp forced liquidations later on,” the analyst said, adding:</p><blockquote>“This environment may pave the way for a period of relative stability or the formation of a more solid price base for Ethereum in the near future.”</blockquote><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c5821-f26a-7154-aaa0-f2768b2dcf0e.png" /><figcaption><em>ETH open interest 30-day change.

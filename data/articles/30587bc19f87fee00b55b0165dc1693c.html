It reportedly skidded off the runway and hit nearby vehicles.</p></div><div><p>The defence ministry later confirmed its C-130 Hercules was involved and that it had been transporting banknotes to the Central Bank of Bolivia. There were eight people aboard the plane, the air force commander said.</p></div><div><p>Police fired tear gas to disperse crowds allegedly trying to take the scattered banknotes.</p></div><div><p>Video footage showed the plane on the ground and badly damaged vehicles. In other videos, people could be seen running away from the tear gas and police officers, some holding shields, forming a line. Some in the crowds are seen throwing rocks. </p></div><div><p>"While news crews were covering the accident, individuals attempting to steal the transported money attacked the press with unusual violence," the National Association of Journalists of Bolivia said in a statement. </p></div><div><p>It said a mobile TV unit was "directly targeted", while other journalists "were attacked with stones, suffering serious injuries while carrying out their work". </p></div><div><p>The government-run Bolivian News Agency reported that at least a dozen people were arrested for stealing banknotes. </p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/01af/live/5d338730-1460-11f1-801d-ed3cff6bf876.jpg.webp" alt="Reuters Bolivian banknotes are seen scattered at the crash site in El Alto, Bolivia.

It also issued an urgent appeal for blood donations. </p></div><div><p>El Alto International Airport was temporarily closed following the crash.</p></div><div><p>"My sister told me that she was in the car when the plane crashed. The plane's tire fell on the car, and my sister was injured because the impact of the tire hit her on the head, so we rushed her to the hospital," a man told the Reuters news agency.</p></div><div><p>It was not immediately clear what caused the crash, but some witnesses said the weather at the time was treacherous.</p></div><div><p>"A heavy hailstorm" was falling and "there was lightning" when the plane went down," a woman whose car was struck by the aircraft wreckage told the AFP news agency.</p></div><div><p>An investigation into the incident is under way.</p></div></article></div></div>

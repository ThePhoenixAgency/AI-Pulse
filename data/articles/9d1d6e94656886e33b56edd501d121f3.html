</p><h2>How to Enhance Photo Quality on Mac with Aiarty Image Enhancer</h2><p>Inside Aiarty, you can restore photo quality with or without resolution upscaling, and adjust enhancement strength. 
</p><p>Here's how it works:
</p><div><p><a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66654-139778-D2-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66654-139778-D2-xl.jpg" alt="Photo editing software interface showing sidebyside comparison of a neoclassical building and vintage cars in Havana, with adjustment sliders and export options on the right panel" /></a></p><p><span>Enhance your old images. Image source: Digiarty</span></p></div><ol>
<li><strong>Add flawed photos to Aiarty Image Enhancer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Choose the AI model and preview the difference in real-time.</strong><p>Select x1 for refinement while keeping the original resolution, or choose x2, x4, 8K, or custom dimensions for large displays and 300-dpi prints.</p></li>
<li><strong>Drag the strength slider and compare the results.</strong><p>Depending on the image type, you might want a higher strength for more detail, or a medium strength to keep a more natural feel while enhancing clarity.</p>
<p><a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66654-139777-D3-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66654-139777-D3-xl.jpg" alt="Sidebyside closeups of a small brown bird's head, showing original photo and two increasingly sharp, enhanced versions with clearer feather detail and onscreen sliders labeled strength and upscale settings." /></a>

<li><strong>Optionally, you can adjust colors or retouch photos.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Export the enhanced photos in bulk.</strong><p>Aiarty's models are optimized for Mac silicon chips and Nvidia/AMD/Intel hardware for efficient processing. You can enhance a single image or batch upscale to save time. </p></li>
</ol><h2>Best practices and AI model settings</h2><p>Aiarty Image Enhancer offers essential AI models to cover different photo types and quality restoration scenarios. You don't need technical skills, and you can easily switch models to compare the differences.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>More-Detail GAN v3</strong>: This model restores images to better clarity and sharpness, with improved detail for skin, fur, fabric textures, and architectural surfaces. Applying 2-pass processing (running it twice) enhances more details.
<p><a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66654-139776-D4-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66654-139776-D4-xl.jpg" alt="Split-screen editing view of a man cleaning a black motorcycle in a driveway, focusing on the front wheel, with the left side smaller and the right side enlarged for comparison" /></a>

<p>If you prefer a more natural restoration, besides tuning down the strength of the More-Detail model, you can also switch models easily and see quality enhancements in real time.</p></li>
<li><strong>Real-Photo v3</strong>: This model works well for wildlife shots, portraits, landscape photos, low-light interiors, real-estate images, underwater photography, etc. Use it to enhance photo clarity, fix soft-focus, and restore natural sharpness, while staying faithful to the original feel of the image.
<p><a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66654-139775-D5-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66654-139775-D5-xl.jpg" alt="Sidebyside coral reef comparison, showing purple branching soft corals and fluffy yellow polyps under deep blue water, highlighting texture and color differences between the two panels" /></a>

</li>
<li><strong>AIGCsmooth v3</strong>: Ideal for digital illustrations, artwork, AIGC assets, and anything where a smoother, more even, and natural look is preferred.
<p><a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66654-139774-D6-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66654-139774-D6-xl.jpg" alt="Sidebyside closeups of a freckled child with curly light brown hair, blue eyes, and clusters of orange berries and pale leaves behind the head, showing beforeandafter sharpening." /></a>

</li>
</ul><p><strong>For each model, upscaling is optional.</strong>
</p><p>Aiarty has algorithm modules to analyze quality problems, then deblur, denoise, or enhance clarity naturally. Image upscaling is not a must.
</p><p>You can opt for x2, x4, and higher resolutions, or select x1 to keep the original resolution during quality restoration.
</p><h2>Use cases and tips</h2><h3>Enhance Photography</h3><p>For large-size images such as <strong>wildlife photography</strong>, the noise reduction in Aiarty's models works nicely to clean up photos while keeping the details clear and vivid. It distinguishes high ISO noise from natural film grains and textures, delivering a faithful result without altering your artistic intention.
</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.aiarty.com/ai-image-enhancer/story-coolwildlife.htm?ttref=2602-aia-media-apis-gp-tyq-lyq" target="_blank">read this cool wildlife hands-on test using Aiarty</a>, with straightforward before-and-after comparison and tips for best quality settings.
</p><h3>Restore Old Photos and Portraits</h3><p>For <strong>old portraits</strong> and low-resolution images, you can start with standard quality enhancement, choosing AI models such as MoreDetail or Real-Photo.
</p><p>In some cases, you can enable the face restoration feature, upscale to x4, or run it again at x2 to restore skin details and reduce blur. Gradual upscaling with strength control helps deliver a natural result while enhancing clarity.
</p><h3>Erase Unwanted Objects and Enhance Quality</h3><p>For blemishes and unwanted objects, you can use the built-in erase tool to brush over for a cleanup.
</p><h2>Aiarty deals: Save 49% on Image Upscaler and Enhancement Software</h2><p>The recent updates to Aiarty Image Enhancer add more formats, TIFF/DNG export, new Face Restoration models, and an AI eraser tool, along with an optimized image upscaling and enhancement workflow.

<p>Presidents’ Day sales are delivering some excellent drone deals this week, and if you’re looking to get started, there are two standout options worth your attention. In fact, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> has slashed prices on a pair of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/dji">DJI</a> models that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-beginner-drones">we highly recommend for beginner pilots</a>.</p><p>First up is the ultra-light DJI Mini, a beginner-friendly <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/4k">4K</a> drone that’s incredibly easy to fly and requires no registration thanks to its featherweight design. With 31 minutes of flight time, three-axis stabilization, and handy features like one-tap takeoff and automatic return, it’s a fantastic gateway into aerial photography - and today’s record-low pricing has this one <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07FTPX71F%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-us-1267004758358067200-20" target="_blank">at just $149 (was $199)</a>.</p><h2>Today's best drone deals at Amazon</h2><ul><li><strong>See more</strong>: <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8428&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FHobby-RC-Quadcopters-Multirotors%2Fb%2Fref%3Ddp_bc_3%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D11608080011%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtrd-us-3966292534865782484-20" target="_blank">check out all of Amazon's drone deals today</a></li></ul><h2>Are DJI drones still a good buy in 2026?</h2><figure><div><p>

</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future | Nico Goodden)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re new to flying drones, you might be concerned about how the 2025 ban impacts these models. The good news is that the restriction applies only to newly imported drones, meaning existing inventory already in the country - including the Neo and Avata 2 - isn’t affected.</p><p>Both these models are lighter-weight options, too, which means you don't need to pre-register them with the authorities before you fly them. If you see any drones highlighting their weight as under 249g, then that's because this is the cut-off point between what's defined as a beginner drone and an enthusiast-level drone. The weightier drones can usually fly faster for longer and capture better footage, but don't discount these two models if you're looking to get started.

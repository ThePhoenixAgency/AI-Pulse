The US has been increasing its military presence in the region in recent weeks.</p></div><div><p>The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied. </p></div><div><p>US and Iranian officials have met over the issue in Switzerland and said progress has been made in the talks.</p></div><div><p>Speaking on Friday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was preparing "a draft of a possible agreement" and would hand it over to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the next few days.</p></div><div><p>The talks in Geneva were held as American forces continued ramping up their presence in the vicinity of Iran.</p></div><div><p>The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.</p></div><div><p>USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is also being deployed, joining an increase of destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.</p></div><div><p>Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces.</p></div><div><p>"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware," one of Khamenei's posts read.</p></div><div><p>Trump takes questions from journalists several times a week - often in lengthy sessions in the Oval Office or on Air Force One - but his comments do not necessarily always translate into concrete actions, and often contradict each other.</p></div><div><p>He is fond of reminding reporters that he prefers to keep his intentions to himself and a small circle of insiders to avoid potential adversaries knowing his next moves.</p></div><div><p>"I'm not going to talk to you about that," he snapped at a reporter on Thursday when asked about potential military action. "We're going to make a deal or get a deal one way or the other."</p></div><div><p>Even if an operation is carried out, Trump has so far yet to specify what the precise military objective would be, with US officials having reportedly presented him with a wide range of options for what could be a weeks-long campaign.</p></div><div><p>In the past, Trump has also used deadlines to achieve an element of surprise.</p></div><div><p>At the time of Operation Midnight Hammer in July last year - which saw US forces strike Iranian nuclear facilities - White House officials were still publicly discussing the possibility of successful talks.</p></div><div><p>The day before US missiles and bombs struck the facility, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read a statement from Trump in which he said that because "negotiations may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks".</p></div><div><p>Any strikes in the near future would come at a challenging time domestically for the Trump administration, with polls showing that a growing number of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration and the economy.</p></div><div><p>Unlike the one-day strike in Iran last year and the quick operation to capture Nicolás Maduro in January, a protracted, multi-week conflict with Iran threatens alienating parts of Trump's Maga base which were drawn to his campaign promise of an end to messy foreign entanglements.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/640e/live/4b8d2f70-0e81-11f1-b048-c9424b2cf5fd.png.webp" alt="A map of the Middle East, Europe and North Africa with the locations of US military deployments marked.

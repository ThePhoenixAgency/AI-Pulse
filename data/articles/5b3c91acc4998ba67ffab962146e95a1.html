    <div><div><h2>A bitcoin price drop to $58,000 could reignite buying momentum.</h2><p><span> Feb 13, 2026, 10:19 a.m. </span></p></div><div><p>Bitcoin's <span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin"><span><span><span>BTC</span><span></span><span>$70,139.59</span></span></span></a></span> long-term rally is "broken" and will remain so until the price climbs above $85,000, said Jean-David Péquignot, chief commercial officer of derivatives exchange Deribit. </p><p>The largest cryptocurrency has settled into the $60,000 to $70,000 range in the past week, some 45% below the record high it hit in October. It's on track to fall for a fourth straight week, and dropped below $85,000 at the end of January.</p><div><p><span>STORY CONTINUES BELOW</span></p></div><p>"Until the market reclaims $85k, the longer-term chart remains broken, and the path of least resistance technically remains lower," Péquignot said in an interview during the Consensus Hong Kong conference.</p><p>Rising above $85,000 would confirm that buyers have established control, having soaked up all the supply that wrecked the long-term outlook. The bitcoin price was recently near $66,600, well below Péquignot's make-or-break level, and deep in bear territory with room for more pain.</p><p>Speaking of the pain, $60,000 is the next big support, a price that nearly came into play early this month as bitcoin wilted alongside software stocks. According to Péquignot, it is a major psychological level, where large buy walls, or multiple purchase orders, have historically resided.</p><p>"If $60k fails to hold on a closing basis, the 200-week MA is the next logical, and possibly final stop for this correction," he said.</p><p>The 200-week simple moving average (SMA) is widely regarded as the holy grail for bottom fishers, or traders hunting bargains at bear-market lows to time their bullish bets.​ Since 2015, multiple bitcoin bear markets <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/02/why-a-usd58-000-bitcoin-is-the-key-number-for-crypto-investors-right-now">have hit lows near</a> this average, which is why traders now track it closely. The average is currently located at around $58,000.</p><p>"Traders would be looking at the $58k–$60k range as the ultimate support," Péquignot said.</p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>Trump-linked Truth Social seeks SEC approval for two crypto ETFs </p><div><p>14 hours ago</p></div><figure><img alt="(Alex Wong/Getty Images)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F6a274a4a92ce9bfd254f3fd35114c253a1e4f438-4380x2920.jpg%3Frect%3D0%2C0%2C4380%2C2464%26w%3D1920%26h%3D1080%26auto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" /></figure><p>The filings include a bitcoin and ether ETF and a staking-focused Cronos fund, deepening the Truth Social brand’s ambitions in digital asset investing.</p><div><p>What to know: </p><div><ul><li>Yorkville America Equities, the firm behind Truth Social–branded ETFs, has filed with the SEC to launch a Truth Social Bitcoin and Ether ETF and a Truth Social Cronos Yield Maximizer ETF.</li><li>The proposed Cronos-focused ETF would invest in and stake Cronos (CRO) tokens, aiming to generate yield through staking rewards in addition to price exposure.</li><li>If approved, the funds would be launched in partnership with Crypto.com, which would provide custody, liquidity and staking services, and be distributed through its affiliate Foris Capital US LLC.</li></ul></div></div><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/13/trump-linked-truth-social-seeks-sec-approval-for-two-crypto-etfs">Read full story</a></p></div></div></div>

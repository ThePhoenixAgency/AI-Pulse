<div> <hr><ul><li><strong>Microsoft AI head says white-collar jobs could be at risk from AI</strong></li><li><strong>Major change could be coming over next 12-18 months</strong></li><li><strong>Mustafa Suleyman is the latest in a series of tech CEOs to sound alarm on jobs effect</strong></li></ul><hr><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s AI chief has declared his belief AI is set to advance so far as to be able to replace white-collar job roles within the next 12-18 months.</p><p>Speaking in a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/youtube">YouTube</a> interview with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f1ec830c-2f08-4b1a-b70f-7330f260753c" target="_blank"><em>Financial Times</em></a>, Mustafa Suleyman addressed the company's push towards “artificial capable intelligence” a term he coined for the next step towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p><p>“I think we’re going to have a human-level performance on most, if not all, professional tasks," Suleyman said. "So, white-collar work, where you’re sitting down at a computer - either being, you know, a lawyer, or an accountant, or a project manager, or a marketing person - most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months.”</p><h2>AI jobs risk</h2><p>Suleyman also outlined his belief <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-ai-tools">AI tools</a> will be useful for almost every area, as Microsoft looks to more towards "humanist superintelligence".</p><p>“There are going to be billions of digital minds," he said. "There are going to be many, many different lineages of model. Creating a new model is like creating a podcast or writing a blog - it is going to be possible to design an AI that suits your requirements for every institution, organization, and person on the planet.”</p><p>Suleyman's opinions have been echoed by many other tech leaders in recent months, reflecting a wider shift in the industry as AI becomes more commonplace in workplaces across the world.</p><p>In May 2025, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei also <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/are-white-collar-jobs-at-risk-from-ai-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-certainly-thinks-so" target="_blank">warned the US government about the risk AI poses to white-collar jobs</a>, predicting up to half of all entry-level roles could be taken by AI, leading to unemployment of as much as 20% in the next one to five years.</p>

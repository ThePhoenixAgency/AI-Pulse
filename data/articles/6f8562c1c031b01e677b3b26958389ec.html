    <div><div><p>Bitcoin may be headed for its worst first quarter in eight years, with data showing Bitcoin is already down 22.3% since the start of the year.</p><p>The asset began the year trading around $87,700 and has declined by around $20,000 to current lows of around $68,000, putting it on track for its worst first quarter since the 2018 bear market — which fell almost 50%, <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/today" target="_blank">according</a> to CoinGlass. </p><p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) has declined in seven of the past thirteen Q1s, with the most recent being 2025 when it lost 11.8%, 2020 when it shed 10.8%, and the largest ever, 2018, when it dumped 49.7% in just three months. </p><p>“The first quarter of the year is known for its volatile nature,” <a href="https://x.com/DaanCrypto/status/2022944468282859650" target="_blank">observed</a> analyst Daan Trades Crypto on Sunday.</p><p>“So it’s safe to say, whatever happens in Q1 does not generally translate over further down the line, according to the historical price action,” he added.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6512-1e31-7f7e-89e9-36647771d466.jpg" /><figcaption><em>Bitcoin on track for its worst Q1 since 2018.

The asset lost 10.2% in January and is down 13.4% so far this month. It needs to reclaim $80,000 to prevent a red February. </p><h2>Bitcoin is in a correctional phase</h2><p>Nick Ruck, the director of LVRG Research, told Cointelegraph that the ongoing decline in BTC price amid persistent global economic uncertainty “reflects a regular correctional phase rather than a structural breakdown in the asset’s long-term trajectory.” </p><p>“While short-term pressures could intensify if macroeconomic headwinds persist, historical patterns show Bitcoin’s resilience often leads to strong recoveries in later months, particularly as institutional adoption and halving cycle dynamics continue to strengthen its potential,” he added. </p><p>Meanwhile, BTC has entered its fifth consecutive week of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-sentiment-at-lowest-point-since-luna-crash-as-btc-tanks-to-60k">losses</a>, falling 2.3% over the past 24 hours to $68,670 at the time of writing, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" target="_blank">according</a> to CoinGecko. </p><p><em><strong>Magazine: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-exchange-coinbase-ethereum-price-recovery-bitcoin-etf-hodlers-digest/"><em><strong>Coinbase misses Q4 earnings, Ethereum eyes ‘V-shaped recovery’: Hodler’s Digest</strong></em></a></p></div><p>Cointelegraph is committed to independent, transparent journalism.

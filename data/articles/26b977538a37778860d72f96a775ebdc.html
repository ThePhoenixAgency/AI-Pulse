Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier – is currently in the Atlantic Ocean en route from the Caribbean to the Middle East, after being ordered there by Trump earlier this month. It is accompanied by three destroyers.</p> <p>It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers – which carry dozens of warplanes and are crewed by thousands of sailors – in the Middle East.</p> <p>The United States had two of the massive warships in the region in June last year when it targeted three Iranian nuclear sites during Israel's<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251226-looking-back-israel-iran-12-day-war-direct-conflict-breaks-out-between-arch-enemies" target="_self"> 12-day campaign of strikes</a> on Iran.</p> <h2>Aircraft</h2> <p>The United States has also sent a large fleet of aircraft to the Middle East, according to open-source intelligence accounts on X and flight-tracking website Flightradar24.</p> <p>These include F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jets, F-15 and F-16 warplanes and the KC-135 aerial refuelling aircraft that are needed to sustain their operations.</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/09ce125a-0127-11f1-9238-005056bf30b7/w:980/AP24331357505235.jpg" alt="Un officier de la marine américaine passe devant les avions de chasse sur le pont d'envol du porte-avions Abraham Lincoln le 26 novembre 2024."> <figcaption> <span>Fighter jets on the deck of aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln.</span> <span> Fazry Ismail, AP file photo</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>On Wednesday, Flightradar24 showed multiple KC-135s flying near or in the Middle East, as well as E3 Sentry airborne warning and control aircraft and cargo planes operating in the region.</p> <h2>Protests, threats, talks</h2> <p>Trump ordered the Lincoln to the Middle East as Iran cracked down on protests that were initially driven by economic grievances, but which turned into a mass movement against the Islamic republic.</p> <p>The clerical leadership that took power after the 1979 Islamic revolution responded to the demonstrations with deadly force and has held onto power, with many opponents of the system looking to outside intervention as the most likely driver of change.</p> <p>Trump had repeatedly warned Iran that if it killed protesters, the United States would intervene militarily, and also encouraged Iranians to take over state institutions, saying "help is on the way".</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251226-looking-back-israel-iran-12-day-war-direct-conflict-breaks-out-between-arch-enemies" target="_self">Looking back at Israel and Iran's ‘12-day war’: Direct conflict breaks out between arch-enemies</a></p> <p>He pulled back from ordering strikes last month, saying Tehran had halted more than 800 executions under pressure from Washington, but has since renewed threats against Iran.</p> <p>US and Iranian officials held talks in Geneva on Tuesday aimed at averting US military intervention, with Iran saying afterward that they had agreed on "guiding principles" for a deal.</p> <p>But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that while there was "a little bit of progress made", the two sides are "still very far apart on some issues".</p> <p>Leavitt also told journalists there are "many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran," adding: "Iran would be very wise to make a deal."</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AFP)</em></p> </div></div>

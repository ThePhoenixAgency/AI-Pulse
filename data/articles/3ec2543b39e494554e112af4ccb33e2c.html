  <div class="content"><p>(Image credit: Future) The gorgeous Edifier ES300 portable speaker has only been on the market for six months, so this discount made me sit up and take notice — right now you can pick it up at Walmart for just $299 (was $399).This a pretty impressive Presidents' Day sales offer on this high-res wireless speaker, bringing it down to a very decent price — and this deal covers either colorway: the black edition or, my personal favorite, the white and gold edition. Check out the offer in more detail below.Today's best Edifier ES300 dealWhen I first tested this portable wireless speaker for my Edifier ES300 vs Sonos Move 2 comparison feature, I was hugely impressed with its styling and audio separation. However, I did feel that it struggled to measure up to the Move 2 when it came to bass impact and impact, meaning I felt the latter offered better value despite its high price.This discount changes that calculation for me. Not only does it give you 25% off the Edifier's price, but it means it's a full 33% cheaper than the Sonos's $450 list price. For me, its less forthright sound is less of an issue at this kind of price point, meaning it's definitely worth considering if you can't stretch to the Sonos Move 2.Want a budget banger or a super-luxe audiophile-thrilling speaker instead?

<p>ExpressVPN's Valentine's Day sale ends today. This means you've only got a few hours left to get ExpressVPN's lowest-ever prices.</p><p>The biggest savings are available on two-year plans. These start from just<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X363&amp;xcust=trd_us_1523449497785075474&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.expressvpn.com%2Fc%2F221109%2F3418589%2F16063&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fvpn%2Fvpn-services%2Fexpressvpns-lowest-ever-price-ends-today-here-are-the-quickest-and-best-ways-to-save" target="_blank"> $2.44 per month</a>, paid as $68.40 upfront. Alternatively, for a shorter commitment, one-year plans start from $3.49 per month, paid as <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X363&amp;xcust=trd_us_9258744347499107182&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.expressvpn.com%2Fc%2F221109%2F3418589%2F16063&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fvpn%2Fvpn-services%2Fexpressvpns-lowest-ever-price-ends-today-here-are-the-quickest-and-best-ways-to-save" target="_blank">$52.39 upfront</a>.</p><p>ExpressVPN remains one of only 3 VPNs ever to top our rankings. Despite falling to fourth spot more recently, it's seen some huge performance improvements – particularly on its Lightway Turbo protocol – which means it's among the fastest and most secure VPNs available.</p><h2>The best ways to save on ExpressVPN</h2><p>The biggest savings and lowest price are available with a Basic plan. This is currently <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X363&amp;xcust=trd_us_2352873629470745184&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.expressvpn.com%2Fc%2F221109%2F3418589%2F16063&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fvpn%2Fvpn-services%2Fexpressvpns-lowest-ever-price-ends-today-here-are-the-quickest-and-best-ways-to-save" target="_blank">only $2.44 per month</a>, down from $3.49, and includes four extra months on two-year plans.</p><p>This budget plan is more affordable than the alternatives offered by <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nordvpn">NordVPN</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/protonvpn">Proton VPN</a>, and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/norton-secure-vpn">Norton VPN</a> at the moment. However, for a super budget alternative, Surfshark's <a href="http://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1611&amp;url_id=2410&amp;aff_id=1691&amp;aff_click_id=trd-us-1195439782989486473&amp;aff_sub2=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fvpn%2Fvpn-services%2Fexpressvpns-lowest-ever-price-ends-today-here-are-the-quickest-and-best-ways-to-save" target="_blank">$1.99 per month Starter plan</a> is hard to beat.</p><p>If, however, you want the full spread of new ExpressVPN features – namely ExpressAI, ExpressKeys, ExpressMailGuard, and Identity Defender – then you'll want an Advanced plan.</p><p>These cost <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X363&amp;xcust=trd_us_7935035014377578153&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.expressvpn.com%2Fc%2F221109%2F3418589%2F16063&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fvpn%2Fvpn-services%2Fexpressvpns-lowest-ever-price-ends-today-here-are-the-quickest-and-best-ways-to-save" target="_blank">$88 upfront for 28 months of protection</a>, equivalent to $3.14 per month, and give you everything ExpressVPN has to offer for only a fraction more than the basic plans from Proton and NordVPN.</p><p>You also get the benefit of 12 simultaneous connections rather than 10. Plus, if you're unsure, both plans offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>

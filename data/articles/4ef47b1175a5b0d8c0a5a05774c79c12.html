  <div class="content"><p>(Image credit: ExpressVPN) ExpressVPN's Valentine's Day sale ends today. This means you've only got a few hours left to get ExpressVPN's lowest-ever prices.The biggest savings are available on two-year plans. These start from just $2.44 per month, paid as $68.40 upfront. Alternatively, for a shorter commitment, one-year plans start from $3.49 per month, paid as $52.39 upfront.ExpressVPN remains one of only 3 VPNs ever to top our rankings. Despite falling to fourth spot more recently, it's seen some huge performance improvements – particularly on its Lightway Turbo protocol – which means it's among the fastest and most secure VPNs available.The best ways to save on ExpressVPNThe biggest savings and lowest price are available with a Basic plan. This is currently only $2.44 per month, down from $3.49, and includes four extra months on two-year plans.This budget plan is more affordable than the alternatives offered by NordVPN, Proton VPN, and Norton VPN at the moment. However, for a super budget alternative, Surfshark's $1.99 per month Starter plan is hard to beat.If, however, you want the full spread of new ExpressVPN features – namely ExpressAI, ExpressKeys, ExpressMailGuard, and Identity Defender – then you'll want an Advanced plan.These cost $88 upfront for 28 months of protection, equivalent to $3.14 per month, and give you everything ExpressVPN has to offer for only a fraction more than the basic plans from Proton and NordVPN.You also get the benefit of 12 simultaneous connections rather than 10. Plus, if you're unsure, both plans offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. Rob is TechRadar's VPN Editor.

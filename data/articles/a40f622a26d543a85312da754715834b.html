Shortly afterward he launched his own centre-right party, Tisza (Respect and Freedom), and vowed to crack down on corruption and bring Hungary closer to Europe.</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a

by step, brick by brick, we are taking back our homeland and building a new country, a sovereign, modern, European Hungary,” Magyar said shortly after founding his party.</p> <p>Just a few months later, Tisza stunned Hungary’s political establishment by securing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hungary-opposition-campaign-orban-f4e2d7a7cc73a19cc0dbb18a7286835d" target="_blank">almost 30 percent </a>of the votes in the European parliamentary elections – cementing Magyar’s role as Orban’s most serious challenger yet.</p> <p>As both contenders launched their campaigns over the weekend, Magyar’s Tisza already held a comfortable 10-point lead over Orban’s Fidesz – and has done so over the past year, according to a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/hungary/" target="_blank">combined poll by Politico</a>.</p> <p>“Tisza stands ready to govern,” Magyar said at his launch event.</p> <ul> <li> <h2>Why is Orban’s rule in danger?</h2> </li> </ul> <p>Aside from the Fidesz “family values” brand taking a serious hit with the 2024 pardon scandal – prompting some of the party’s conservative members to defect to Tisza – Orban has been unable to to get Hungary’s bleeding economy back on track.&nbsp;In 2023, a presidential pardon had been secretly granted to the deputy director of a children’s home convicted of covering up a case of child sex abuse.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the wake of Russia’s 2022 invasion of <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ukraine/" target="_self">Ukraine</a> – which pushed the country’s energy prices to the skies – Orban also introduced new income rebates, which in 2023 resulted in the worst inflationary surge in Europe, at a staggering 25 percent.</p> <p>Although the worst of the financial crisis has since subsided, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/orbans-giveaways-still-not-turning-election-tide-hungary-2025-12-22/" target="_blank">Eurobarometer survey cited by Reuters</a> last autumn showed that rising prices, inflation and cost of living still top Hungarians’ main concerns.</p> <p>The state of the country’s economy has also been weighed down by the fact that the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/european-union/" target="_self">European Union</a> has blocked some <a href="https://www.epc.eu/publication/after-orban-why-peter-magyar-would-not-be-an-easy-partner-for-the-eu/" target="_blank">€20 billion</a>&nbsp;in funds <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/12/billions-funding-wrongly-released-hungary-eu-court-adviser" target="_blank">over corruption and the rule of law concerns</a>.</p> <p>The economy is in other words a sore point for Orban, and Magyar has taken every opoortunity to point that out.</p> <ul> <li> <h2>Europe in focus</h2> </li> </ul> <p>The real battleground in the April ballot will be the two candidates' opposing views on the EU.</p> <p>While Orban last week declared that the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hungary-orban-eu-russia-election-408ab04702c28390fef5ba785bf14a2d" target="_blank">real danger to Hungary is the EU</a>, Magyar has gone the other way: “Hungary will once again be a full-fledged member of the European Union,” he told a Budapest rally last year, touting the EU as the answer to Hungary’s prayers, especially if it releases the withheld EU funds.</p> <p>On Saturday, Orban told supporters that “Brussels … [is] a source of imminent danger”, adding that the April ballot is therefore a choice between “war and peace”, and that Fidesz, with its anti-EU stance, therefore is the only “safe choice”.</p> <p>Orban's anti-establishment and nationalist views has won him support from US President <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/donald-trump/" target="_self">Donald Trump</a>, and on Monday US Secretary of State <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/marco-rubio/" target="_self">Marco Rubio</a> paid him a symbolic visit, telling him "<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260216-rubio-meets-orban-as-trump-ally-lags-in-polls-ahead-of-hungary-elections" target="_self">your success is our success</a>".&nbsp;</p> <p><span>Read

during Hungary visit ahead of elections</a></p> <p>Orban hopes his ties with Trump wil help him collect the votes needed to prolong his reign.</p> <p>If he wins the elections, he has promised to "clear away" the "oppressive machinery of Brussels" in his country.</p> <ul> <li> <h2>Views on Russia and Ukraine</h2> </li> </ul> <p>Under Orban, Hungary has remained Russia’s closest EU ally throughout the war, routinely blocking any European sanction packages against what has remained – despite pleas from Europe&nbsp;– its main gas supplier.</p> <p>He has equally tried to stonewall any military or financial aid to Ukraine. And at the end of last year, he even went as far as to say it was “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/hungary-orban-eu-russia-election-408ab04702c28390fef5ba785bf14a2d" target="_blank">unclear who attacked whom</a>”.</p> <p>Although Magyar has described Moscow as “the aggressor” in the conflict, and last year <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e80489e2-48c8-4f24-b423-9a7b89154da3" target="_blank">told the Financial Times</a> he would push for an immediate ceasefire along with Hungary’s EU allies if he comes to power, he has also said he would not reverse Hungary’s current policy of non-support for Kyiv nor totally sever Budapest’s ties with Russia. He staunchly opposes fast-track EU accession for Ukraine.</p> <p>"On Ukraine, Tisza’s manifesto is notably thin," <a href="https://www.epc.eu/publication/after-orban-why-peter-magyar-would-not-be-an-easy-partner-for-the-eu/" target="_blank">an analyst note</a> from the Brussels-based think-tank European Policy Center warned, adding that "EU leaders should not assume that a Magyar government would mark a clean break with Orban-era policies."</p> </div></div>

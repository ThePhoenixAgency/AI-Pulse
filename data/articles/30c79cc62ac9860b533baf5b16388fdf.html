    <pre><code>Image: Foundry A good MacBook bag shares many qualities with Apple’s laptops. We want it to be tough, so it needs to be made from good materials. We want to use it for multiple tasks, so it needs to have plenty of pockets and compartments. Let’s admit it, with the diminishing number of ports on the MacBook, the bags often have the edge. And since we all admire good design here, we certainly don’t mind if the bag looks fantastic. Plus, whatever MacBook you’ve got, Air or Pro, you’ve probably spent enough on it that you don’t want to risk it breaking—and don’t mind spending just a little more to keep it safe. There’s no shortage of companies out there that make protective accessories for MacBooks, from laptop bags and rucksacks to sleeves, covers, and shells that clip on directly, and plenty of them do their best to be just as stylish as the Mac they’re protecting. We’ve rounded up a selection of our favorite cases, sleeves, backpacks, roll-tops, shells and totes for the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, whether you have a 13-, 14-, 15- or 16-inch model, to keep your Mac safe. Some might seem expensive but remember you are entrusting the bag to protect your valuable MacBook and also relieving stress on your body when carrying it. Here’s where you don’t want to skimp and risk your laptop, back and neck. Keep reading for the full list or jump to your preferred type of laptop carrier below. A sleeve usually just protects the MacBook from scuffs and knocks when carried on its own or as further protection within a bag. Backpacks offer a lot more storage aside from your tech. Briefcases are somewhere in between and often look more business smart. We rounded up other bags such as duffles, messenger bags and totes, and finished with protective shells that encase the MacBook for all-day protection. Best MacBook sleeves Best MacBook backpacks Best MacBook briefcases Best MacBook bags Best MacBook shells Best laptop sleeves for MacBook A simple or multi-function laptop sleeve keeps the MacBook protected during travel either tucked under your arm or not taking up too much space in a bag. Bellroy Laptop Sleeve – Best MacBook sleeve Pros Premium feel Magnetic closure Colors Price When Reviewed: €59 Best Prices Today: €18.85 Fits: 13-14-inch and 15-16-inch versions Bellroy is a Australian accessory brand that makes premium bags, cases and wallets, and its laptop sleeves offer high-quality protection. The outside of the Bellroy laptop Sleeve is made from a woven, water-resistant material that is eco-friendly—made from 100% recycled PET bottles. Inside, the quilted microfiber lining features a soft ridge that holds your laptop in place. The sleeve snaps shut with a neat magnetic bumper. Available in Black, Slate, Navy, Bronze and a leather-free Saltbush. Bellroy Apple sells only one MacBook sleeve in its online store: the leather-free Bellroy Caddy for Mac Laptops, which is available in two sizes for 13-14-inch MacBooks and the 15- and 16-inch MacBooks. There’s fold-down, front-pocket access and a foam-padded laptop sleeve, as well as two stretch mesh pockets and mesh pen slips. STM Origin &amp; Kin laptop sleeves – Best budget MacBook sleeves Pros Padded with soft interior Handle on Kin model Color range Best Prices Today: STM $19.95 Fits: 13-14-inch, and 15-16-inch versions STM has made some of our favorite laptop sleeves and bags for many years and its two new laptop sleeves, the Origin and Kin, offer minimalist form but good-looking designs in a few different colors, featuring 4mm shock-absorbing EVA padding and plush fleece interiors. The simplest sleeve is the slim-profile, two-tone Origin Sleeve, available in Black Slate, Glacier Blue and Lilac Plum. Available in Black Slate, Aqua Blue and Rose Petal colors, the slightly wider Kin Sleeve features a retractable carry handle at one end, and there’s a zippered pocket for accessories. Case Logic Reflect Laptop Sleeve – Budget MacBook sleeves Pros Tight fit Padded Color range Best Prices Today: Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch and 15-16-inch versions Case Logic makes many laptop sleeves that are suitable for various sizes of MacBook and come in all number of colors. The Case Logic Reflect Laptop Sleeve is available for each size of MacBook, whether it’s a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro. It’s form-fitting, so the MacBook shouldn’t slip about inside, and it features padding for extra protection. There is woven webbing along the sides to further protect the laptop and strengthen the case. It’s a slim case that should fit nicely inside your bag.&nbsp; Available in a range of strong colors, including Pink, Dark Blue, Lime Green and Teal. U.K. buyers should try here. Case Logic also offers a sleeve for 14-inch laptops. Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve – Best wireless charging sleeve Pros Luxury sleeve Includes MagSafe wireless charger Doubles as desk pad Best Prices Today: Fits: 13-14-inch, and 15-16-inch versions The Journey NEXA laptop sleeve bills itself as a 4-in-1, and it certainly is multi-functional. As well as protecting your laptop during travel, it includes two wireless chargers (one MagSafe compatible) and can work as both a deskpad and mousepad to free your workspace of clutter. Slide your MacBook into the soft but padded-for-protection vegan leather sleeve, and you’ll be impressed by the luxury feel of this premium laptop sleeve. When you arrive at the office, hotel or just back home, it doubles up as a desk-pad with chargers for your iPhone (7.5W MagSafe Compatible) and AirPods (5W). While it comes with a USB-C cable, you’ll need to add your own charger (check our roundup of the best iPhone chargers) to connect with the USB-C port in the sleeve. Alternatively you can charge the MacBook itself while it sits protected in the sleeve—for this you’ll need a more powerful MacBook charger. There’s also a new $149 or £109 NEXA LIFT model, with an adjustable iPhone stand, compared to the flat-charging pad on the basic NEXA. The Journey NEXA 4-in1 Laptop Sleeve is available in Black or a fetching stone-like Dove Gray. Read our full Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve with Wireless Charging review Orbitkey Hybrid Laptop Sleeve – Sleeve folds out to comfortable desk mat Pros Folds into portable desk and mouse mat Magnetic closure Best Prices Today: Fits: 13-14-inch, and 15-16-inch versions Designed in collaboration with storage-joy expert Marie Kondo, this tri-fold design laptop sleeve has a second function as foldout portable desk and mouse mat. It oozes Japanese calm in its cool Stone color and inside traditional Sashiko wave pattern. Transform the office hot desk or coffee shop tabletop into a comfortable and organized workspace.Place the laptop to the left and use the top of the laptop pocket as a mouse mat. Its vegan leather exterior feels both luxurious and protective, and the zip-free magnetic closure is a joy to use. The limited-edition KonMari sleeve ($89.90 / £79.90 for 13- and 14-inch laptops, and $99.90 / £89.90 for 15- and 16-inch) looks great but there are cheaper black and terracotta color options ($79.90 / £69.90 for 13/14-inch, and $89.90 / £79.90 or 15/16) of the Hybrid Sleeve. Grams (28) Leather Folio – Luxury sleeve with storage Pros Premium look and feel Neat accessory pockets Cons Expensive Best Prices Today: Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch This super-stylish MacBook sleeve doesn’t just keep your laptop safely protected in transit, it also includes exterior and interior pockets to allow you to ditch the backpack and just look the business carrying a sleek fine Italian leather sleeve. The spacious interior has plenty of room for your MacBook Pro and is padded for extra care. Inside there are two pockets for your phone, a charger, cables, or other accessories such as a paper notebook, plus two pen holders and a card pocket. As a bonus there’s even a little pocket for an Apple AirTag. An front exterior pocket gives quick access to paperwork or just the latest issue of a newspaper or style magazine. You can personalize the Leather Folio with up to four letters, in white or colorless lettering. It measures 14.3-x-0.2-x-1 inches (36.3-x-25.9-x-2.5-cm, and weighs 15.2oz (430g). It’s available in Black, Dark Blue, Olive or Fossil Gray. For the 13-inch MacBook you’ll want the 114 Leather Folio, for 14-inch MacBook the 120, and 118 for a 15-inch or 16-inch MacBook. Woolnut Leather Sleeve for MacBook – Luxury leather sleeve Pros Premium look and feel In-sleeve charging Cons Lack of pockets Expensive Price When Reviewed: 119 € Best Prices Today: Woolnut €119 Fits: 12-inch, 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Available in four deeply stylish colors (Black, Cognac, Green and Gray), the Woolnut Leather Sleeve snugly fits every recent MacBook from the 12-inch original, the Air and all the Pro models. Each size is tailor-made for every model. This minimalist sleeve might lack pockets but it is as luxe as you’ll find and will draw admiring looks and awed strokes from fellow MacBook owners. The exterior is made from full-grain Scandinavian leather, with the interior soft 100% natural wool felt from Germany. Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve – Storage options Pros Premium look and feel Accessory pockets Wool felt interior Cons No sealed pockets Best Prices Today: Fits: 11-inch, 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Similar to the Mujjo Envoy Laptop Sleeve, reviewed above, the Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve is made from premium full grain leather and features outside pockets to store your charger and cables. It looks classy and is available in tan or black. There are versions for all recent models of MacBook. It boasts a soft but protective dense 100% wool felt interior that will keep your MacBook cosy. Harber Harber makes some other luxury laptop sleeves, such as the distinguished pebbled leather Legacy Laptop Sleeve (a considered buy at $379 / £229, available in Brown pictured above, Black and Caoba, and in two sizes for 13/14-inch and 15/16-inch MacBooks) that features a well-padded interior for extra protection and a generous zipped front pocket for your charger and cables or notebook and pens. Read our full Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve review Casemade Leather Laptop Case Pros Wool Lining Inner Pocket Cons Not a lot of extra space for bulkier items Best Prices Today: Fits: 14-inch, 16-inch This more affordable, securely zipped leather laptop sleeve protects the MacBook with its wool lining creating a snug fit. Inside the folio case there’s a separated second compartment for your charging cable and some other slim objects. It’s maybe too slim to carry a bulky charger, though. It’s available in the traditional plain Black and Tan that leather laptop sleeve makers prefer, and for either the 14-inch or 16-inch MacBook Pro, although we’re sure that the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air models will fit just as nicely. For safe and comfortable laptop transport a quality backpack is hard to beat. There are more traditionally business-like laptop briefcases (reviewed lower down) but a premium laptop backpack can also look businesslike while distributing the weight better than a briefcase and including plenty of extra storage for your other travel essentials, gym kit or shopping. We have also road tested different type of laptop bag, such as duffels and tote bags. Troubadour Matrix Backpack – Best premium MacBook backpack Pros Stylish and smart inside and out Plenty of organizer pockets Recycled materials Cons Premium price Best Prices Today: Fits: up to 16-inch Capacity: 20L Apple builds its MacBooks to a high spec and premium design, so if you are carrying yours around in a backpack maybe that should also be top-notch, too. And, like Apple’s products, the Troubadour Matrix comes with a premium price tag attached. You do get your money’s worth, with chic styling and a generous selection of storage pockets, including one for your iPhone hidden in one of the straps, which means you can access it—or other valuable item such as your wallet—without having to remove the bag from your shoulders. And there’s even a special pocket for an Apple AirTag. The Matrix isn’t just smart in looks. It has been designed with the tech traveller or commuter specifically in mid, and its pockets and compartments are welcoming to all your portable gadgets. The lower front pocket folds all the way down to allow easy access to your charger, cables and other tech essentials. The insides are light colored so you can see everything inside much easier than groping around a darker interior. Troubadour Other Troubadour backpacks for your MacBook Troubadour makes another fine laptop backpack: the Apex 4.0, recently further refined from the Apex 3.0 we reviewed. This is lightweight and comfortable but still generous, with a 22L capacity. There is also a Compact version, with a 16L capacity. The laptop section is at the back and easy to access, with easily enough space for a 16-inch MacBook Pro. Altogether there are 14 sections or pockets, pen holders and zipped enclosures. Unlike the Black-only Matrix, the Apex 4.0 is available in Black, Basalt, Ink Blue, Bronze Red and a very unique Green Smoke. Read our Troubadour Apex 4.0 Backpack review. Troubadour’s lightest and latest laptop (and most affordable) backpack is the 20L Neo, built for the daily commute or whenever you need it. Inside the waterproof and durable FortiWeave fabric—woven from 100% recycled plastic bottles—are lighter-colored compartments that make it easier to spot your tech, hydration and quick-access essentials via a discreet front pocket with a gracious magnetic closure. A&nbsp;CrashPad Cocoon laptop sleeve suspends and cushions your MacBook (13- to 16-inch). It’s available in four unique colors: Rust, Bronzed Olive, Charcoal Black and Basalt. Further down we review the Apex Tote and Apex Briefcase for flexibility in the. smart range. Read our full Troubadour Matrix Backpack review Stubble &amp; Co The Roll Top 20L – Best MacBook roll-top backpack Pros Premium look and feel Plenty of accessible pockets Striking range of colors Best Prices Today: Fits: 13-inch (15L bag) and 13-16-inch (20L) versions Capacity: 15L and 20L A roll top bag is simple to use as they have fewer straps and zips than a traditional backpack. They feature a wide top opening so you can quickly see what’s inside and make it easier to reach in and pull out your belongings. It is adjustable in volume as unused space can saved and bulking reduced by rolling up the top flap as you close it. Tighten the strap to condense the load or loosen when more space is required. The Stubble &amp; Co’s The Roll Top is available in either 15L or 20L capacities. We tested the spacier 20L model. It is available in some smart color accents and options: Black, Yellow, Urban Green, Arctic White, Tasmin Blue, Concrete, Sand and Ember Orange. The padded laptop compartment is easily accessed at the side of the bag. The 20L version fits up to a 16-inch MacBook; the 15L allows for a 13-inch laptop. Inside the laptop compartment and also lining inside the main bag are contrasting colours: inside the black, white, concrete and green bags, it’s a striking orange. The main compartment has a reinforced, magnetised roll top closure. I’m used to a more click-tight buckle fastening but am getting the hang of the G-hook fastener. There are five internal organiser pockets, including two with mesh. On each side are generous elasticated side pockets for your water bottle, umbrella or bike lock. And, an essential if carrying the bag off your back, there’s a top grab handle. Roll-tops are often used by cycle couriers for their fast, easy access, and the Stubble &amp; Co Roll Top features a bike light anchor and reflective trim for enhanced visibility and road safety. Pakt Travel Backpack 3.0 – Best MacBook travel backpack Pros Premium build Plenty of storage Smart organizer sections Multiple carry options AirTag pocket Sustainable materials Cons Premium price Best Prices Today: Fits: up to 16-inch Capacity: 35L or 45L We haven’t found a laptop backpack that beats the Pakt One Travel Backpack for storage smarts, comfort and versatility. There are many imitators but this remains our (and many luggage geeks) favorite, and there’s a recent version 3.0 that makes it even better and more environmentally friendly. Pakt listens to feedback from its users to keep refining the details. In the now lighter V3 there’s a new non-cling PFAS-free, water-resistant recycled nylon that resists lint, pet hair, and dust, an adjustable Torso System to accommodate a wide range of body types, a redesigned (and removable) padded hip belt with multi-layer load support to transfer more weight to your hips. Still removable when you don’t need it. Like a hard suitcase, inside the clamshell interior is the main compartment divided into two for superior travel organization. The padded laptop sleeve fits up to a 16-inch laptop, and is positioned in the center to further protects your tech but still accessible from the top for easy access at airport security. The front admin pocket handles a bunch of tech gear you might need close to hand, such as AirPods, chargers, power banks and cables, or even an iPad. There’s also a brightly colored key leash in this part. There are two sizes: 35L at 21.5 x 12.5 x 8 inches (55 x 32 x 21cm) to meet the carry-on criteria for most airlines; and 45L at 23 x 13 x 9 inches (60 x 33 x 24cm). An expansion pocket adds an extra 5L and even fits Pakt’s 14L MODE Convertible Bag ($185) that switches easily between sling and backpack modes or more business-oriented briefcase-style 12L MODE Shoulder Bag ($160). This extension section has been moved from the exterior to the inside, where it’s closer to the wearer’s back for better weight distribution when carrying. A bag within a bag opens up a lot of flexibility. Also on the flexible front, you can use the Pakt One as a backpack or hide away the straps to carry via a top handle or by the side handles as a duffle. Check your favorite airline for carry-on limits. On the plane, you could remove this and store by your feet for easy access, and then slide it back in the pack when you take that out of the overhead when you disembark. There are so many great extra features: the water-bottle holder is generous in size yet a tight elasticated hold; a zipped, hidden pocket at the back and bottom of the pack is handy for placing your phone, wallet and pocket fodder when you are passing through airport security; one of the pocket sections includes a deep AirTag holder; you can pull out hidden accessory straps on one side; and there’s roller-luggage passthrough to give your back a rest. Pakt One V3 is available in three colors: Black, plus the refreshingly different Cypress and Mojave. All the components are shades of the same color. STM Dux Backpack – Unique easy-access backpack Pros Premium build 360-degree padding Accessible side-wing doors Comes with tech organizer pouch Cons Premium price Best Prices Today: STM $199.95 Fits: up to 16-inch Capacity: 30L Not all backpacks have to be structured the same way as others, and STM’s Dux Backpack takes a different view of how you add and retrieve your items from the bag with side wing panel doors that give access from both sides plus removable and re-positionable hook-and-loop internal shelves for your personalized organisation. Dux is Australian slang for “best in the class” and STM calls this backpack a “tech fortress” as it features 360-degree foam padding and a tough EVA shield at the bottom to protect from everyday impacts. The “SlingTech” laptop section is suspended from the bottom of the bag, further protecting the laptop from the impact zone, with space for up to a 16-inch MacBook Pro. At the front and top is a cascading pocket that two zipped mesh pockets can drop from for easy access. The top pocket floor can be unzipped to give access to the full bag interior. At the back of the bag’s top section behind the carry handle is a deep stash pocket for secure placement of your passport or other slim valuables. There are zipped mesh pockets on the pull-out wings as well as other flexible pockets, and side water bottle pockets, a key clip and cable keeper. For travellers, there’s an all-important luggage passthrough at the back for rolling luggage transport. The Dux also comes with a separate EasyStash removable accessory pouch for on-the-go items such as chargers and power banks, or maybe makeup and other daily essentials. The STM Dux is available in 16L and 30L. Only the 30L model features the unique internal removable and customisable shelving system. It’s available in a range of dark colors such as Black Night, Blue Sea, Grey Storm, and Black Camo, plus a direct-only brighter multicolored 70s-style retro option, pictured above, to make you and your backpack stand out from the crowd. Bellroy Classic Backpack, Daypack and Rolltop – Great color and model range Pros Premium build Multiple options Color choices AirTag pocket Best Prices Today: Bellroy $145 Fits: up to 16-inch Capacity: 20L (Backpack); 21L (Daypack); 26L (Rolltop) Bellroy can always be relied on to produce quality bags and it has three new backpacks—the Classic Backpack, Classic Daypack and Classic Rolltop—each in a great range of colors: Black, Olive, Butterscotch and Tahini. The Butterscotch versions might appeal to owners of the Cosmic Orange iPhone Pro. The Classic Backpack and Daypack (pictured above) are similar—with the major difference being the lighter Backpack’s more streamlined side-access front pocket, compared to the more traditional and longer-commute Daypack’s lower front pocket, side slip pockets and top handle. The Rolltop (below) has one side pocket and a top handle like the Daypack. Bellroy All three are comfortable but robust in a soft-feel matte fabric, with a different colored interior to make finding your gear easier. Inside, the padded laptop sleeve can carry up to a 16-inch laptop, and has a document slip to the front and a further zipped pocket. The Backpack and Daypack both feature a drop-down zip opening for easy packing and unpacking, while the Rolltop has a top-opening more capacious interior with the bag adjustable to four heights. Each features dual-density padded back panel and shoulder straps plus luggage pass-through and an internal Apple AirTag slip pocket. UAG 24L Premium Tech Backpack – Tough, padded laptop bag Pros Tough, premium backpack Plenty of pockets, inc AirTag Two accessible laptop/tablet compartments Decent 24L capacity Best Prices Today: Fits: up to 16-inch Capacity: 24L UAG bags, sleeves and laptop cases always look seriously tactical, and will appeal to those desire a militia look.The company has a new backpack that is built specifically for the tech traveler, and this tough 24L backpack delivers in many ways. First, it’s robust made from rugged ballistic 1050D nylon. Your MacBook will be protected in its padded compartment that has room for not just a laptop but probably a couple of iPads if you pack that much screen tech. The front opens all the way with a clamshell main compartment opening fully flat for full access to your stuff, with two zipped compartments inside. An easy-access front pocket is more generous than most, and there’s a microfiber-lined pocket on the top. There are fewer interior organization pockets than some of the backpacks reviewed here, although there are concealed passport and AirTag pockets. We like that both sides feature handles as does the top by the laptop entrance. Airmesh cushioning, padded shoulder straps, and a sternum strap are provided for carrying comfort. One side features the obligatory water bottle pocket, while the other features a neat zipped pocket with built-in key lanyard, pen holders and maybe space for another small bottle or micro-umbrella. Just for fun, the front features a velcro strip with UAG panels and moveable three cute colored buttons that you can do with as you please, maybe adding patches from your travel adventures or corporate logos—a curiosity on such a no-nonsense-looking backpack. Waterfield Bowery Leather Backpack – Full-leather luxury Pros Premium full-leather build Two accessible laptop/tablet compartments Gorgeous gold inner liner AirTag pocket Cons Premium price Best Prices Today: WaterField Designs $549 Fits: up to 16-inch Capacity: 18.5L WaterField Designs handcrafts some of the finest leather tech bags in its San Francisco workshop. The Bowery Leather Backpack is its first-ever all-leather backpack that develops a unique patina as it ages. The main compartment zips open all the way down at an angle so your stored items can be easily retrieved even when the bag is packed. And you can see inside even when it’s dark because the inner water-resistant liner is a gold so gorgeous that you’ll be wanting to open the bag at every opportunity. There’s an AirTag slot hidden in the zippered pocket inside the main space. The double-layer leather flap is kept in place by WaterField’s clever hands-free Fidlock buckle that magnetically draws the two sides together. Waterfield What makes it stand out even further is its double padded-sleeve laptop compartments that mean you can carry your MacBook and iPad together. You don’t need to fully open the bag to gain access to these compartments. You can store your most frequently accessed items—iPhone, charger and cables, plus travel documents—in the organizational front pocket, which also opens fully through the zips reaching right down each side. There’s a keychain here, as well as three pockets and two slots for your pen or iPad stylus. To keep the clean profile of the backback, the collapsible water bottle sleeve is inside. The padded shoulder straps are comfortable and there’s a carry handle at the top, plus a wheeled suitcase passthrough at the back. It’s available in WaterField’s signature Black, Chocolate and Grizzly Leather colorways. Timbuk2 Authority Laptop Backpack Deluxe – Padded laptop bag Pros Premium backpack Plenty of pockets Decent 28L capacity Price When Reviewed: 189 € Best Prices Today: Timbuk €191 Fits: 15-inch Capacity: 28L If you have an Apple laptop and intend to take it outside the house or office from time to time, it goes without saying that you will need a good sturdy bag to carry it in. We recommend getting a well padded backpack that is designed for carrying a laptop. A well designed backpack will include lots of areas insider the bag to store things in: such as a front pocket, a large main compartment and a large side pocket. Quilted shoulder straps and a padded back should ensure the backpack is comfortable to wear. It’s pricy, but the Timbuk2 Authority Laptop Backpack Deluxe is a good option. Scapade AirPack Backpack – Includes built-in Apple Find My tracker Pros Integrated rechargeable Find My tracker Decent 28L capacity TSA lock Best Prices Today: Fits: 16-inch Capacity: 28L The AirPack Backpack, from Bacelona-based Scapade, is packed with smart features and surely the most luxurious fleece padded laptop compartment of any backpack.&nbsp;While some bags include a pocket for you to slip in an AirTag, this backpack include an integrated tracker that works with Apple’s Find My app so that users can quickly locate their backpack via iOS or macOS devices. The tracker has wireless charging (at the back of the bag) and a flashing indicator that signals active tracking for added peace of mind. You’ll need a magnetic wireless charger or power bank as the backpack doesn’t ship with one.&nbsp; The backpack’s dedicated padded compartment fits laptops up to 16-inch MacBook Pro but will nestle even a 13-inch MacBook Air within its padded section that is has an incredibly soft velvety lining.&nbsp;Below, you could also slip in an iPad. The lightweight (1.3kg) backpack opens up flat for easy packing and unpacking, with a roomy 28L of organised within its water‑resistant 29.5 x 20 x 45cm dimensions. There are two zipped side pockets and a front easy-access zipped compartment at the front, plus two zipped pockets inside, along with two flexible pockets for chargers and accessories. The AirPack Backpack is also equipped with a TSA-approved hidden zip lock at the top of the backpack, so highly secure while still compliant with airport regulations. Alpaka Bravo Backpack – Well-organized laptop bag Pros Smart organization inside and out Sustainable materials Best Prices Today: Fits: up to 16-inch Capacity: 23L Relatively plain—but available in three colors of Midnight Blue shown above, Black, and Green—the lightweight and comfortable Bravo Backpack is not flashy but is packed with storage options inside and out. Smart access points include a well-padded laptop sleeve and surprisingly capacious fold-down front section for easy access to your essentials, which is light colored to make finding those everyday items simple even in dark spaces.

Its eco-friendly, weather-resistant Axoflux fabric is made from recycled plastic bottles. Best MacBook briefcases A briefcase with laptop protection is slimmer and more traditionally business-like laptop storage than a backpack, but with less extra-stuff capacity. 1. Troubadour Apex Briefcase – Best MacBook briefcase and messenger bags Pros Can hold MacBook and iPad Pockets for tech organization Premium build Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Premium price Best Prices Today: Fits: up to 16-inch Capacity: 15L If you desire the convenience of a shoulder or messenger bag with the smartness of a modern briefcase, another part of the stylish if pricey Apex line of laptop bags is the Apex Briefcase—in black only.

On the outside there are three pockets, including at the front a hidden slip-pocket for your phone and a large zipped pocket with a key leash, elasticated pockets and an AirTag pocket. On the rear, a magnetically closing pocket can be unzipped at the bottom to create a luggage sleeve. Transform the briefcase into a hands-free shoulder bag with a robust strap. 2. Nomatic Laptop Bag – Stylish MacBook briefcase Pros Can hold MacBook and iPad Pockets for tech organization Premium build Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Premium price Best Prices Today: Fits: up to 16-inch Capacity: 13.5L Nomatic (known as Gomatic in the U.K.) has given a basic name for its Laptop Bag but it’s smart in both looks and organization. The padded compartments for laptop and tablet feel safe and secure for your most valuable tech, and there are plenty of easy-access fleece-lined front pockets for the organization of all your accessories. These include meshed and zipped sections so your stuff stays in place. You can carry the Laptop Bag like a briefcase using its comfortable padded handle or sling it over a shoulder like a messenger bag via its detachable strap. It is easy to expand the case from 11L to 13.5L for when you need to pack more than you thought. There is, of course, a luggage pass-through. 3. Incase A.R.C. Brief 12L – Best budget compact MacBook briefcase Pros Compact Pockets for tech organization Premium build Handle and detachable shoulder strap Sustainable materials Cons Not for 15- or 16-inch MacBooks Best Prices Today: Fits: 13-14-inch Capacity: 12L A more affordable but still premium laptop briefcase, the Incase A.R.C. Brief is so compact (measuring 15 x 12 x 4 inches) it almost resembles a sleeve, and makes a great compact commuter bag. Inside there are a lot of pockets for device organization, plus a soft but protective lining for your MacBook. There’s also a zipped pocket on the outside for easy access to wallet, headphones and keys. It’s made of ReSpun 100% Recycled Polyester for sustainability points. And there’s a handy but discreet AirTag pocket for Find My peace of mind. Owners of the larger 15-inch and 16-inch MacBooks must sadly look elsewhere as this is for the smaller laptops only. 4. Thule Gauntlet Attaché – Laptop briefcase-like shell Pros In-use hard-shell case Detachable shoulder strap Cons Small capacity Price When Reviewed: 70,24 € Best Prices Today: Fits: 14-inch, 16-inch Capacity: 4L If you are looking for a smart, tough-looking briefcase style bag with a solid construction, a good option is the Thule Gauntlet attaché. It’s a slim and rugged case with enhanced corner and edge protection. There is a single, removable shoulder strap as well as handles. You don’t even need to remove the Mac from the case to work, although there’s not a great deal of space for extra storage. It’s available for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. The 16-inch model is available in blue as well as black. 5. Harber London Rugged Laptop Briefcase – Luxury MacBook briefcase Pros Can hold MacBook and iPad Pockets for tech organization Premium build Made from 100% Recycled Plastic Bottles Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Expensive Best Prices Today: Fits: up to 16-inch Capacity: 5.6L or 7.5L If carrying a briefcase just reminds you of your schooldays or executives on Mad Men, think again as today’s stylish briefcases are less boxy and make a far better impression than dropping a boring backpack on the boardroom floor. While this smart and stylish, without being too formal, laptop briefcase is called Rugged, its looks and build quality are at the luxury end of the laptop bag scale—and it’s priced accordingly, although it’s not over the top for a premium business briefcase that’s handmade by expert craftsmen in Spain. And, yes, it is rugged with a water-resistant outer fabric shell made of recycled plastic bottles, so environmentally friendly too. That said, we wouldn’t take this laptop briefcase out hiking in the woods—it’s just too lovely to dump in some mud outside your tent. Available in two sizes—5.6L capacity for 13/14-inch and 7.5L for 15/16-inch laptops, it can hold a MacBook and a large iPad in its padded laptop and tablet compartments. It’s got special pockets for notebooks and your passport, as well as two clever detachable magnetic pouches for your chargers or other tech essentials. There are nine interior sections, holders for pens, and a row of card slots, as well as a dedicated integrated AirTag pocket. It can be carried by its full-grain cowhide leather handle or the detachable leather carry strap, and is available in Mocha, Black or Olive. 6. Harber London Nomad Organiser – Premium Organizer for MacBook Pros Pockets for tech organization Premium luxury leather looks Can hold MacBook and iPad Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Bulks up quickly if over-stuffed Expensive Price When Reviewed: €395,95 Best Prices Today: Harber London €395.95 Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch While a laptop seems like a self-contained unit, with keyboard, screen, trackpad, hard drive and everything all in one tidy package, it’s not quite as easy as that. You need a charger and charging cable for starters, and when you’re on the move you have to carry around your AirPods, and maybe you prefer a proper mouse to the MacBook’s trackpad. And what if you have an iPad to work on, too? A simple sleeve can’t cope with all that lot, but the Nomad Organiser certainly can. The Nomad has ten pockets: a padded one for your MacBook Pro, and another padded pocket that fits an iPad from 9.7 to 12.9 inches, and capacious enough to handle the tablet with a Smart Cover. Be warned, though, that holding both laptop and tablet, the sleeve can be tricky to close if you are stuffing in chargers and other tech too. One lower pocket is big enough for your MacBook charger, but you’ll notice a bump in the fine lines when closed. I prefer to keep my bulky stuff in a wider-opening bag—check out our favorite tech organizer bags—and use this sleeve for the thinner essentials. Two pockets are zipped for safe-keeping (for example, cash or memory cards) and there’s a handy key fob strap. There’s a couple of holders for pens or an Apple Pencil. There’s a phone pocket, too, but I’m not sure I’d want all my devices in one place, and most of us prefer our phone at hand in a pocket or more-easy-to-dip-in bag. If you do, it’s large enough for a Pro Max iPhone. Below that pocket are a couple of slots for credit or travel cards, and above it are five straps that will hold an AirPods case, cables and even an AirTag—after, all, at this price, even the sleeve on its own is definitely worth keeping tabs on at all times. I’d have preferred elasticated straps for a firmer hold but I can appreciate the all-leather design looks super lush. You can carry the Nomad Organiser under your arm, via a subtle built-in handle, or you can attach a matching strap to sling it over your shoulder like a messenger bag. It is a premium MacBook sleeve, handcrafted with full-grain Spanish leather, and really does shout cool luxury. Available in Tan, Dark Brown, Black and Navy. Best MacBook bags: laptop-friendly duffel, tote bags and more Bags comes in many shapes and sizes from backpacks to briefcases, but in between there are some fantastic laptop duffel, tote and messenger bags. 1.

Orbitkey Daily Tote – Most adaptable MacBook tote bag Pros Multiple pockets Choice of capacites Premium build Cons Crossbody strap costs extra Best Prices Today: Fits: 16L: 13-inch, 14-inch; 21L: 15-inch, 16-inch Capacity: 16L or 21L Backpacks aren’t for everyone, and one of today’s most popular types is the tote bag—a versatile large, open-top bag with two parallel side handles, designed for carrying a variety of items from shopping to everyday essentials and can make a stylish accessory for work or travel.&nbsp; If one of those everyday essentials is your laptop, then you should look for a tote outside of the ordinary canvas types and including specialized laptop storage. The weather-resistant Orbitkey Daily Tote includes a dedicated padded laptop compartment plus a topple-free structured base to prevent spills in the first place. The laptop section is accessible even when the tote is zipped shut, making extraction easy without disturbing anything else in the bag. The top of the tote is zippered so both secure and easy access as are internal twin mesh pockets for other tech or your go-to items. At the front is a magnetic quick access pocket, and at the back is a secure hidden zipped back pocket and luggage pass-through. You can buy an extra crossbody bag strap for an extra $20. Available in Black, Stone, Lilac and Olive it comes in a choice of two sizes: 16L and 21L. If you have a 15-inch or 16-inch MacBook—or carry lots of stuff around with you—choose the 21L version. 3. Troubadour Apex Everyday Tote – Best MacBook luxury tote bag Pros Super stylish Plenty of storage Smart organizer sections AirTag pocket Cons Premium price Best Prices Today: Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Capacity: 16.5L Bags come in all shapes, sizes and styles, and our favorite laptop tote bag is the from the same range as the Troubadour Apex Backpack reviewed above. There isn’t much “everyday” about the Apex Everyday Tote. It is most definitely a special tote, with zipped inside storage and nine interior mesh, zipped or open pockets and compartment, plus two on the exterior. You can pack a lot of gear in the 16.5L bag, including organized spaces for cables and chargers, power banks and passport. You can keep a water bottle tightly upright inside, and still feel confident that your laptop is safe from spills with the padded laptop pocket boasting a neoprene hood. There’s a zipped front exterior pocket that offers plenty of storage space, including a pocket for your AirPods case and a special AirTag pocket. The back exterior pocket can be unzipped at the bottom to create a luggage sleeve, allowing you to slip it over the handles of your suitcase. The waterproof FortiWeave fabric is made from recycled plastic bottles, and the zip pulls are also recycled. A vegan leather trim keep the tote looking smart. When you tire of carrying the bag by its handles, you can turn it into a shoulder bag with the included non-slip detachable strap. It available in Black, Scree (a stony color) and Basalt (grayish blue). 4. Casetify Bounce Carry On Roller Pros Super-protective hard shell 33.8L capacity AirTag pocket Optional Tech Pack Organizer TSA-approved locks Customization options Cons No special laptop compartment Expensive Best Prices Today: Casetify $699 Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Capacity: 33.8L Makers of larger luggage are finally taking tech gear into consideration, too. We wouldn’t recommend you packing your precious MacBook into an aircraft’s hold section because of the risks of damage through rough handling, extreme temperatures and potential theft during transit. But carry-on cabin luggage is a fine place to securely protect your laptop in flight. We were therefore intrigued when one of our favorite iPhone case manufacturers, Casetify, unveiled its range of hard-shell luggage, building on its expertise in tech protection and particularly its Bounce range that has integrated protective bumpers and sides that we trust to keep our phone safe through enhanced impact absorption if dropped or knocked out of our hand. Casetify has scaled its protective Bounce technology for luggage: both the cabin-sized 21-inch Bounce Carry On Roller, and 29-inch suitcase. Each case shell is made from super-durable Makrolon polycarbonate, while remaining relatively lightweight: the carry-on cabin suitcase weighs 8.23lbs (3.75kg). There is no special laptop compartment but you can buy a clip-in Tech Pack Organizer ($50) for your chargers and cables. The superbly named Hinomoto Miraclent 360° ball-bearing wheels are the best we’ve tested in a suitcase, and genuinely glide the case across the floor. There’s a robust aluminum telescoping handle and what Casetify calls a puncture-resistant YKK double racquet coil zipper. It looks and feels sturdy like the rest of the case. There’s integrated TSA-approved locks for security, and even an AirTag pocket to help you track your luggage when it leaves you at the bag-drop counter. Aside from the premium quality and ultra-protective shell, there are a raft of made-to-order customization options for the cases, on top of the choice of black, blue and red shells, including six background patterns, and a choice of fonts and colors for your initials that make finding your luggage simple in the sea of lookalike cases dropping onto the carousel. Best shells for MacBook Not strictly a bag but more a protective skin for your beloved MacBook, a shell can protect the laptop without adding bulk. 1. Incase Edge Hardshell for MacBook – Best MacBook hard shell Pros Protects in use Best Prices Today: Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Choose a hard shell if you want to wrap your precious MacBook in robust scratch and bump protection but still be able to use it in action.

It protects with raised edge bumpers in its high-impact resistant polycarbonate shell. All ports and buttons remain fully accessible.

Speck SmartShell – Simple, colorful shell Pros Protects in use Best Prices Today: Fits: 13-inch If you want to protect your laptop while you are using it you can pop a clear or tinted case on it.

There’s clear cases as well as a few different colored options, including Cosy Pink, Obsidian and Clear variant for the M2 MacBook Air, so you can pick one to suit your personality. 3. Twelve South SuitCase for MacBook – Hard shell, carry-on fabric hybrid Pros Slim but in-use hard shell Handle Cons Lack of pockets Price When Reviewed: 48,72 € Best Prices Today: Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 16-inch Laptop backpack and bags can be bulky, expecting you constantly to be travelling to airports or on trains, when sometimes you just need the convenience of a slim briefcase with the protection of a hard shell. SuitCase from Twelve South is an odd name for what is effectively a briefcase with a recessed handle, but it’s a great hybrid of sleeve, shell and carry on. There are three layers of protection: a water-resistant, quilted gray fabric exterior; underneath the twill textile is a layer of hard plastic to protect your MacBook from impacts; and inside is a soft layer of microfiber to protect the surface of your Mac. You don’t even have to remove your MacBook from the case to get working, and, when closed, dual zippers keep it securely closed, even when charging. Pros Super robust shell Cons Particular about exact MacBook model Price When Reviewed: 62,62 € Best Prices Today: €75.84 UAG $84.95 Fits: 13-inch Some shell cases are built to do more than give your MacBook a bit of color. A number of manufacturers build hard shell cases that will add an extra layer of protection to your MacBook Pro or Air. UAG (Urban Armor Gear) makes impact resistant armour for your MacBook. The Plyo series has extra strength built into the cushioning corners and cooling vents to ensure that there is adequate airflow (to stop your laptop from overheating). Make sure you buy the exact shell for your model MacBook.

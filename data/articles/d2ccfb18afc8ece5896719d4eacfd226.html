This morning, Apple sent out invitations to a “special Apple experience” on March 4 at 9am ET.</p> <p>Apple generally holds product launches at 1pm ET at its headquarters in Cupertino, so this is definitely a unique event. So far, at least three events will take place in New York, London, and Shanghai, all coordinated to occur at the same time. There does not appear to be a keynote attached to it, but Apple is known to launch new products online at around that time.</p> <p>The invitation includes a stylized Apple logo with three colors: yellow, green, and a bit of blue at the bottom. Just this week, Mark Gurman of Bloomberg <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3061517/low-cost-macbook-in-fun-colors-leads-flurry-of-upcoming-mac-releases.html">reported</a> on a new low-cost MacBook in “fun colors,” so this could be a reference to that. The new machine is expected to use an iPhone processor and cost significantly less than $1,000.</p> <p>Along with the new Macs, several products are rumored to be launching soon, including the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2881175/iphone-17e-release-date-specs-features-price.html">iPhone 17e</a>, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3055278/2026-ipad-air-design-display-specs-release-price.html">iPad Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3030272/2026-ipad-a19-design-display-specs-release-price.html">entry-level iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2655094/m5-macbook-air-design-display-specs-release-price.html">M5 MacBook Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2942089/macbook-pro-m5-pro-max-release-specs-price.html">M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro</a>.&nbsp;Some of those products could arrive in the weeks leading up to the event.</p> <p>The use of the word “experience” implies that the event will be an extended hands-on session with new products rather than a keynote. Apple recently <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3041505/next-weeks-apple-experience-event-seems-like-a-good-time-to-release-new-m5-macbook-pros.html">held a similar “experience” in Los Angeles</a> to show off its new <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3031215/apples-new-creator-studio-is-the-pro-subscription-bundle-weve-been-waiting-for.html">Creator Studio</a>, and has <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/230809/imac-pro-first-look.html">held similar events</a> over the years to promote new products. It’s possible this event will showcase several new products that have released in the days and weeks leading up to March 4.</p> <p>It’s unclear why Apple would choose to showcase new products in this way, but it’s possible there are just too many 2026 announcements to hold events for all of them. Among the products expected to arrive in early March, Apple also has a new smart home hub, a folding iPhone, and a touch-screen MacBook in the works, all rumored to arrive this year.</p> </div> <div> <h3> <a href="https://www.macworld.com/author/michael.simon"> Author: Michael Simon</a>, Executive Editor, Macworld </h3> <div> <p><img src="https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/author_photo_Michael-Simon_1654791181-27.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=110&amp;h=132&amp;crop=1"> </p> <p>Michael Simon has been covering Apple for more than 20 years.

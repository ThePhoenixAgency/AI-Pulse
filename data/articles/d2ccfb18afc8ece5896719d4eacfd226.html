  <div class="content"><p>Image: Apple Summary created by Smart Answers AIIn summary:Macworld reports Apple’s March 4 event will be a ‘special experience’ across New York, London, and Shanghai, featuring hands-on sessions rather than a traditional keynote.The colorful invitation suggests a new low-cost MacBook under $1,000 using an iPhone processor, potentially available in fun colors.Other anticipated releases include the iPhone 17e, new iPad Air models, entry-level iPad, and M5 MacBook Air/Pro variants. It might seem like there’s a new rumor every week about when Apple’s first major product launch will arrive (sorry, AirTag 2), and it looks like we may finally have a firm date. This morning, Apple sent out invitations to a “special Apple experience” on March 4 at 9am ET. Apple generally holds product launches at 1pm ET at its headquarters in Cupertino, so this is definitely a unique event. So far, at least three events will take place in New York, London, and Shanghai, all coordinated to occur at the same time. There does not appear to be a keynote attached to it, but Apple is known to launch new products online at around that time. The invitation includes a stylized Apple logo with three colors: yellow, green, and a bit of blue at the bottom. Just this week, Mark Gurman of Bloomberg reported on a new low-cost MacBook in “fun colors,” so this could be a reference to that. The new machine is expected to use an iPhone processor and cost significantly less than $1,000. Along with the new Macs, several products are rumored to be launching soon, including the iPhone 17e, iPad Air, entry-level iPad, M5 MacBook Air, and M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro.&nbsp;Some of those products could arrive in the weeks leading up to the event. The use of the word “experience” implies that the event will be an extended hands-on session with new products rather than a keynote. Apple recently held a similar “experience” in Los Angeles to show off its new Creator Studio, and has held similar events over the years to promote new products. It’s possible this event will showcase several new products that have released in the days and weeks leading up to March 4. It’s unclear why Apple would choose to showcase new products in this way, but it’s possible there are just too many 2026 announcements to hold events for all of them. Among the products expected to arrive in early March, Apple also has a new smart home hub, a folding iPhone, and a touch-screen MacBook in the works, all rumored to arrive this year.

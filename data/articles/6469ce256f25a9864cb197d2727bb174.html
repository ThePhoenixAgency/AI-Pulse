<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/4WsCOvrgqqznLMGP7prFnK1V_wQ=/400x0/article-new/2026/02/macOS-Tahoe-Finder-Bug-Underscores-Apples-Slipping-UI-Polish-Feature.jpg?lossy" alt="macOS Tahoe Finder Bug Underscores Apples Slipping UI Polish Feature" /><br />If you updated your Mac to macOS Tahoe and you prefer to work in Finder's column view, there's a good chance you've been frustrated by the glitch, which developer Jeff Johnson has been admirably tracking <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2026/2/4.html">over on his blog</a>. </p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/78lhYRtNupU24TqL86XenXzKQzI=/400x0/article-new/2026/02/macos-tahoe-finder-column-view-bug3.jpg?lossy" alt="finder" /></p><p><em>Scroll bar blocking column resize handles (Original image: Jeff Johnson)</em></p><p>At the bottom of each Finder column are handy little resize handles allowing you to expand or reduce each column as you see fit. But in macOS 26 and macOS 26.2, when scroll bars are set to "always show," the horizontal scroll bar at the bottom overlaps and covers those handles, so you can't click them to adjust column widths the way you could in earlier macOS versions like Sequoia. </p>

The vertical scrollers were shortened so the resizing widgets now sit above the horizontal bar and are technically clickable again. Unfortunately though, as Johnson points out, the horizontal scroll bar still overlaps file names in the view, causing it to regularly obscure content. Moreover, if you hide the path bar and status bar, the layout leaves a weird amount of empty space below the scrollers, making the whole thing look unfinished (see image below). </p>

<p>As <em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2026/02/12/more-macos-263-finder-column-view-silliness">points out</a>, it's an embarrassing fudge for a company that used to pride itself on pixel-perfect settings across its Mac operating system. </p>
<p>At this point, it's unclear when Apple will manage to iron out the UI irregularities introduced by Liquid Glass. macOS Tahoe‌ 26.4 is likely to be released in March or April, and could introduce some new Siri features, though at least some of the capabilities that we were expecting may have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/11/siri-features-delayed-ios-26-4/">delayed</a>, depending on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/12/siri-ios-26-launch-confirmed-apple/">who you believe</a>. The update is also expected to introduce new emoji characters.</p>

    <div><div><p>Police have called on Sydneysiders to report any “not normal activity” as they search for 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian, who investigators say <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/14/elderly-sydney-man-kidnapped-in-suspected-mistaken-identity-case">was abducted by mistake</a> in a botched underworld kidnapping.</p><p>Baghsarian was alone in his North Ryde home when he was taken and bundled into a dark-coloured SUV on Friday morning.</p><p>Police hold grave concerns for the grandfather, who needs daily medication, after they were called to the home by neighbours who heard a commotion about 5am.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p><p>Det Acting Supt Andrew Marks said on Monday that police, at this stage, believed Baghsarian was still alive.</p><p>“This is not a typical crime,” he said. “The offenders have got the wrong person. They were intending to take somebody but … they have kidnapped the wrong person.”</p><p>Marks said Baghsarian’s family hadn’t received any ransom.</p><p>“In a normal kidnapping case, we would be aware of a ransom. But because the family are not involved in this type of crime, and they’re not involved in that world, they haven’t received a ransom.”</p><p>Marks said police were “one million per cent confident” the kidnappers had taken the wrong man. He wouldn’t comment on who the intended victim might have been.</p><p>Asked why Baghsarian hadn’t been released if the offenders had the wrong man, Marks said: “Can I answer why they haven’t released him? I can’t answer on their behalf. I don’t know why they have not released him.”</p><p>The detective called on the public to report any “not normal activity” – for example, if people were coming and going to a house where there wasn’t usually such activity.</p><p>Baghsarian was wearing a red and blue flannelette shirt and grey pyjamas when he was bundled out of his house.</p><p>Marks said the fact that the kidnappers had “got it so wrong” was concerning, but others in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney">Sydney</a> “need not fear” for their elderly parents living alone.</p><p>When they arrived at the home on Friday morning, police found signs of forced entry.</p><p>Baghsarian had been in his bedroom when the men broke in.</p><figure></figure><figure></figure><p>CCTV footage published by Nine News shows a dark Toyota pulling into Northcott Street in North Ryde before Baghsarian was taken. A man in high-visibility clothing is seen emerging from the car, followed by an accomplice.</p><p>Moments later, they are seen pushing the elderly man across the landing as the car moves closer.</p><p>Police said a burnt-out vehicle matching the description of the SUV involved had been found nearby.</p><p>Marks on Monday said police had seen a video showing the 85-year-old tied up. Its public release was “not ideal”, the detective said, adding it had not been leaked by police.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales">New South Wales</a> premier, Chris Minns, urged those responsible for the abduction to return Baghsarian.</p><p>“It’s not too late to end this situation … please return him to his family,” Minns said.</p><p>“Let police know where he is currently located or, alternatively, drop Mr Baghsarian off at a shopping centre, an emergency department, or even a nursing home.”</p><p>It is believed Baghsarian is a widower who has lived alone for almost four years.</p><figure></figure></div></div>

During his first term (Jan. 20, 2017 – Jan. 20, 2021), the widely followed <strong>Dow Jones Industrial Average</strong> <span>(DJINDICES: ^DJI)</span>, broad-based <strong>S&amp;P 500 </strong><span>(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)</span>, and innovation-inspired <strong>Nasdaq Composite</strong> <span>(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC)</span> gained 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.</p>      <p>Since Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second, non-consecutive term on Jan. 20, 2025, it's been more of the same. Through the closing bell on Feb. 11, the Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have respectively risen by 15%, 16%, and 18%.</p>   <p><em><strong>Will AI create the world's first trillionaire?</strong>&nbsp;Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an "Indispensable Monopoly" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need.&nbsp;</em></p>   <figure><div> <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KRIxoJLDSm_o5PUgqxooPQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/8ac89d34a6ef4983832753c4520a36fc" alt="Donald Trump delivering remarks to reporters in the East Room of the White House."></p></div> <figcaption>President Trump delivering remarks.

Rumblings of a potential  in year two of President Trump's second term are mounting. Thankfully, several historically correlated events offer clear insight into the likelihood of a stock market crash taking shape.</p>         <p>Before going any further, it's important to note that history can't guarantee that something is going to happen on Wall Street. Although history does tend to rhyme on Wall Street, and certain correlated events have flawless track records of foreshadowing the future, nothing should be taken as a concrete guarantee.</p>   <p>Nevertheless, the following three data-backed correlations provide a historic glimpse of what to expect in year two of Donald Trump's presidency.</p>      <p>The first historical marker deserving of attention is the time-tested Shiller Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio, which is also known as the Cyclically Adjusted P/E Ratio, or CAPE Ratio. The S&amp;P 500's Shiller P/E is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the previous 10 years and has been back-tested to January 1871.</p>    <p>This valuation yardstick is particularly useful in determining the relative cheapness or priciness of Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&amp;P 500. Whereas the Shiller P/E has averaged 17.34 over the last 155 years, it ended the Feb. 11 trading session at 40.35. This is the second-priciest stock market in history, trailing only the dot-com era.</p>  </div></div> <span> </span>  </article>      <section><header> </header>  <div><ul> <li><section><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ask-advisor-1-6m-401-120000377.html"><p><img alt="Ask an Advisor: Should We Shift Assets to an Annuity or Target Date Fund?" src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/61.QNS9mLHdhXk8cOovnaw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDk7cT04MDt3PTE5NDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smartasset_475/58fa2f15c54bf3640ef094d537a69fe6.cf.webp"></p>    </a>  </section> </li> <li><section><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/suze-orman-no-1-money-210233988.html"><p><img alt="Suze Orman’s Top Money Tip Is ‘Very Different’ From Most Advice You Hear" src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/okoDVDmRizskVx0XoeydPA--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDk7cT04MDt3PTE5NDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gobankingrates_644/e123d6bd2385f1bf21b55fdb2f3d50d9.cf.webp"></p>    </a>  </section> </li><li> </li> <li><section><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worry-gift-tax-pay-30-122213443.html"><p><img alt="Will Paying $30,000 Toward My Child's Wedding Trigger the Gift Tax?" src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eH4yXhh55UcSpsTh9fUYFg--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDk7cT04MDt3PTE5NDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smartasset_475/0187c71357ff9013ed9864954bf3aef7.cf.webp"></p>    </a>  </section> </li> <li><section><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/im-62-retiring-soon-structure-115059778.html"><p><img alt="How Should a Portfolio Be Structured at 62 When Retirement Is Near?" src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/10MfVSbBCg_ByWHfbcDSKA--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDk7cT04MDt3PTE5NDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/smartasset_475/5974e6a4e9a77ceb4e678938130cf81f.cf.webp"></p>    </a>  </section> </li><li> </li>  <li><section><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-necessities-frugal-people-don-150046545.html"><p><img alt="5 ‘Necessities’ Frugal People Don’t Buy, According to Frugal Living Expert Austin Williams" src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QF2n3EyuF7FuIZLfL4xW6A--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0xMDk7cT04MDt3PTE5NDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gobankingrates_644/0a07398ea64e11e05200997322c5fa73.cf.webp"></p>    </a>  </section> </li> <li></li>  </ul></div> </section></div></div>

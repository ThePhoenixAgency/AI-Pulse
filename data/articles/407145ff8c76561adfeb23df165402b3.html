    <div><div><p>Traditional finance giant Apollo Global Management Inc. has signed a partnership agreement with decentralized lending platform Morpho to take a significant stake in the project and help support its blockchain lending infrastructure. </p><p>The move was <a href="https://morpho.org/blog/morpho-association-announces-cooperation-agreement-with-apollo/" target="_blank">announced</a> on Friday by the Morpho Association, the nonprofit organization behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. </p><p>The partnership, or “cooperation agreement,” will see Apollo or its affiliates buy up to 90 million Morpho (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/morpho-price-index">MORPHO</a>) governance tokens over the next four years, representing 9% of the total 1 billion-token supply of MORPHO. </p><p>“Under the Agreement, Apollo or its affiliates may acquire MORPHO tokens through a combination of open-market purchases, OTC transactions, and other contractual arrangements, subject to an overall ownership cap of 90 million MORPHO tokens over a 48-month period as well as transfer and trading restrictions,” the Morpho Association said.</p><p>The Morpho Association added that it will also work together to “support onchain lending markets on Morpho’s protocol,” without providing further details. </p><p>The move saw a 17.8% bump in the price of MORPHO over the weekend, rising from around $1.12 on Friday to $1.32 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/morpho" target="_blank">data</a>.</p><p>However, the asset is down 38% over the past 12 months amid a broader crypto market slump.</p><figure>    <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c643d-3196-75e7-8117-934550309229.png" /><figcaption><em>MORPHO price increased over the weekend.

The project primarily provides lending markets and curated investment vaults for investors to earn yield.  </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-enters-defi-institutional-crypto-push-finance-redefined"><em><strong>BlackRock enters DeFi as institutional crypto push accelerates: Finance Redefined</strong></em></a></p><p>The deal with Apollo, a multinational asset manager with <a href="https://alternativecreditinvestor.com/2026/02/09/apollos-aum-hits-938bn-as-origination-sees-record-quarter/" target="_blank">nearly</a> $940 billion in assets under management, marks another significant partnership secured by Morpho in recent months. </p><p>In late January, Cointelegraph reported that digital asset manager <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitwise-becomes-morpho-network-vault-curator">Bitwise had jumped on board</a> to provide curated vaults offering a 6% annual yield on Morpho. Last week, the Bitcoin DeFi project Lombard also announced that Morpho had signed on as an initial liquidity partner for its launch of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/lombard-unveils-bitcoin-smart-accounts-linking-institutional-custody-to-onchain-finance-embargo-weds-9am-et">Bitcoin Smart Accounts</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, Apollo has been gradually upping its exposure to crypto and blockchain. Last year, the firm <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/Coinbase-Asset-Management-and-Apollo-Partner-to-Develop-Stablecoin-Credit-Strategies" target="_blank">partnered</a> with Coinbase to develop stablecoin credit strategies and made an undisclosed investment in Plume to <a href="https://plume.org/blog/apollo" target="_blank">support</a> its real-world-asset tokenization infrastructure. </p><p><em><strong>Magazine: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/crypto-exchange-coinbase-ethereum-price-recovery-bitcoin-etf-hodlers-digest/"><em><strong>Coinbase misses Q4 earnings, Ethereum eyes ‘V-shaped recovery’: Hodler’s Digest, Feb. 8 – 14</strong></em></a></p></div><p>Cointelegraph is committed to independent, transparent journalism.

    <div><div><p>Traditional finance giant Apollo Global Management Inc. has signed a partnership agreement with decentralized lending platform Morpho to take a significant stake in the project and help support its blockchain lending infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>The move was <a href="https://morpho.org/blog/morpho-association-announces-cooperation-agreement-with-apollo/" target="_blank">announced</a> on Friday by the Morpho Association, the nonprofit organization behind the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform.&nbsp;</p><p>The partnership, or “cooperation agreement,” will see Apollo or its affiliates buy up to 90 million Morpho (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/morpho-price-index">MORPHO</a>) governance tokens over the next four years, representing 9% of the total 1 billion-token supply of MORPHO.&nbsp;</p><p>“Under the Agreement, Apollo or its affiliates may acquire MORPHO tokens through a combination of open-market purchases, OTC transactions, and other contractual arrangements, subject to an overall ownership cap of 90 million MORPHO tokens over a 48-month period as well as transfer and trading restrictions,” the Morpho Association said.</p><p>The Morpho Association added that it will also work together to “support onchain lending markets on Morpho’s protocol,” without providing further details.&nbsp;</p><p>The move saw a 17.8% bump in the price of MORPHO over the weekend, rising from around $1.12 on Friday to $1.32 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/morpho" target="_blank">data</a>.</p><p>However, the asset is down 38% over the past 12 months amid a broader crypto market slump.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c643d-3196-75e7-8117-934550309229.png"><figcaption><em>MORPHO price increased over the weekend.

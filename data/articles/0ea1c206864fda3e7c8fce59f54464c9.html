<p>Ubisoft will be kicking off its 11th year of support for <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> with a massive crossover. Today, during the game's latest reveal event, the company revealed that a collaboration with Konami is bringing Solid Snake as a playable character to the tactical shooter. This isn't a limited-time addition either, with him being a permanent Operator following his drop next month.</p>

<p>Solid Snake is landing equipped with the Soliton Radar MKIII gadget and the unique gadget scavenging skill, On-Site Procurement.</p>

<p>The Radar gadget is essentially a mini-map device, letting players see their surrounding map layout and any enemies. Keep in mind that Defenders are notified when they are scanned by the gadget.</p>

                            
            <p>"Solid Snake can get the most out of his Soliton Radar MKIII by switching into precision mode," adds <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/7wYca8Fw674NP93tZe9uDe/solid-snake-joins-rainbow-six-siege-in-operation-silent-hunt">the studio</a>. "When precision mode is active, the radar will display the position icon and vision cone of any enemies it detects, giving Solid Snake real-time intel on exactly where his enemies are and where they are looking."</p>

<p>Next, his On-Site Procurement ability lets him pick up secondary gadgets from downed operators, including frag grenades, stun grenades, smoke grenades, impact EMPs, and breach charges. Unlike others, he starts with only a single secondary charge, but by picking up items during matches, he can carry up to five total.</p>

<p>Outside of his PMR90A2 marksman rifle or the F2 assault rifle as primaries, Solid Snake is also landing with a brand-new secondary weapon. The new TACIT .45 pistol has an integrated suppressor and reflex sight, which is inspired by the Metal Gear Solid series.</p>

<p>The studio is also planning to release a special Metal Gear-themed event later this year. This will have Solid Snake teaming up with Sam Fisher from <em>Splinter Cell </em>for a brand-new 4v4 infiltration-themed gameplay mode.</p>

<p><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> Year 11 Operation Silent Hunt is launching on March 3 with Solid Snake, major balance changes, updates to three maps, and the final chance to play the Dual Front mode before its removal.</p>

<p>Later in the year, the studio plans to have three more major seasonal content updates that will bring a Dokkaebi remaster, a new shield-sporting defender, and another remastered character, alongside fresh weapons, mouse and keyboard support for consoles, new events, and more.</p>

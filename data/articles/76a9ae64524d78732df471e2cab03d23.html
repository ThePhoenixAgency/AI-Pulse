Red Hat's leading input expert Peter Hutterer announced the release overnight of libinput 1.31, the input handling library used by the Linux desktop on both X.Org and Wayland desktop sessions.
</p><p>
With Libinput 1.31 comes support for utilizing fast three-finger swipes when three-finger drags are enabled. Up to now the three-finger swipes were disabled when three-finger drag was enabled, due to closeness in their behavior, but now improvements have been made to try to accommodate both. Peter explained the fast three-finger swipes support in this release:
</p><blockquote>"We now support fast 3fg swipes when 3fg drag is enabled. Previously, enabling 3fg drag meant 3fg swipe was no longer available since the finger movement for both is physically identical. However, swipe gestures are tightly integrated into some desktops so we now support a "fast swipe": three fingers that move quickly and immediatley trigger a swipe, not a 3fg drag. The timeout is intentionally quite short, the drag is still the primary feature. The above applies to 4fg swipe/drag if enabled."</blockquote>
<p>Libinput 1.31 also brings configurable timeouts for the disable-while-typing and disable-while-trackpointing options with laptop touchpads.

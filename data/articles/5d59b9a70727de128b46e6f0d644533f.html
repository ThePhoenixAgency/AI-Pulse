    <div><div><p>This week, the Israeli government approved a plan to designate large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property”, shifting the burden of proof to Palestinians to establish ownership of their land.</p><p>The decision, which undermines the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination, has prompted regional <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/16/israel-to-restart-land-registration-in-west-bank-what-that-means">condemnation</a>, with many describing it as a de facto annexation which is illegal under international law.</p><p>In recent years, Israel has intensified its military incursions, expanded illegal settlements, and demolished Palestinian homes, all as part of a series of aggressive actions to steal more Palestinian land.</p><p>In total, at least 37,135 Palestinians were displaced across the occupied West Bank in 2025, a record high amid Israeli military incursions and settler attacks, according to figures compiled by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Displacemnt-across-the-occupied-West-Bank-west-bank-February-17-2026-copy-1771321245.png?quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE - Displacemnt across the occupied West Bank -west bank - February 17, 2026 copy-1771321245"><figcaption>(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><p>According to UNRWA, Israeli military incursions have forcibly displaced at least 33,362 Palestinians from three northern refugee camps: Jenin (12,557), Tulkarem(11,862) and Nur Shams (8,943).</p><p>In addition to those displaced during Israeli operations, at least 3,773 have been forced from their homes due to Israeli home demolitions, settler violence, and access restrictions.</p><p>The West Bank governorates with the largest number of forced displacements include:</p><ul>
<li>Ramallah and el-Bireh: 870</li>
<li>Jerusalem: 841</li>
<li>Hebron: 446</li>
<li>Nablus: 407</li>
<li>Bethlehem: 397</li>

<li>Jericho: 135</li>
<li>Jenin: 110</li>
<li>Tulkarem: 65</li>
<li>Qalqilya: 60</li>
</ul><h2>Why most demolitions and attacks are in Area C</h2><p>As part of the 1993 <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/13/what-were-oslo-accords-israel-palestinians">Oslo Accords</a>, signed by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel, the occupied West Bank was divided into three areas – A, B and C.</p><p>This led to the formation of the Palestinian Authority (PA) – an administrative body that would govern Palestinian internal security, administration and civilian affairs in areas of self-rule, for a five-year interim period.</p><p><strong>Area A</strong> initially comprised 3 percent of the West Bank and grew to 18 percent by 1999. In Area A, the PA controls most affairs.</p><p><strong>Area B</strong> represents about 22 percent of the West Bank. In both areas, while the PA is in charge of education, health and the economy, the Israelis have full control of external security, meaning they retain the right to enter at any time.</p><p><strong>Area C</strong> represents 60 percent of the West Bank. Under the Oslo Accords, control of this area was supposed to be handed over to the PA. Instead, Israel retains total control over all matters, including security, planning and construction. The transfer of control to the PA never happened.</p><p>Although Area C is the least populated part of the West Bank, with about 300,000 Palestinians compared with about 3 million in Areas A and B, the vast majority of home demolitions and settler attacks occur there, due to it being under full Israeli military and administrative control.</p><p>The Israeli Civil Administration rarely grants building permits to Palestinians in this area, so nearly all construction is considered illegal and subject to demolition.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/INTERACTIVE-Occupied-West-Bank-Area-A-B-C-5-Palestine-1726465625.png?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE - Occupied West Bank - Area A B C - 5 - Palestine-1726465625"><figcaption>(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2>Record number of Israeli settler attacks</h2><p>Since Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza began in October 2023, violence by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank has steadily risen.</p><p>According to data from OCHA, settlers have attacked Palestinians more than 3,700 times in the occupied West Bank over the past 28 months.</p><p>The number of settler attacks has risen sharply since 2016, with 852 recorded in 2022, 1,291 in 2023, 1,449 in 2024 and 1,828 in 2025 – an average of five attacks per day, according to data from OCHA.</p><p>Every West Bank governorate has faced settler attacks over the past year.</p><p>Data from OCHA shows that between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025, the Ramallah and el-Bireh governorate recorded the highest number of settler attacks with 523 incidents, followed by Nablus with 349 and Hebron with 309.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-Settler-attacks-across-the0Doccupied-West-Bank-2024-2025-west-bank-October-14-2025-1771321248.png?quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE - Settler attacks across theoccupied West Bank (2024-2025)-west bank - October 14, 2025-1771321248"><figcaption>(Al Jazeera)</figcaption></figure><h2>Who are Israeli settlers?</h2><p>Settlers are Israeli citizens living in illegal, Jewish-only communities, known as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/6/who-are-israeli-settlers-and-why-do-they-live-on-palestinian-lands">Israeli settlements</a>, built on Palestinian-owned land that Israel occupied in 1967.</p><p>Benjamin Netanyahu – Israel’s longest-serving prime minister – has bolstered settlement expansions since he first came to power in 1996, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/8/how-israel-backs-settlers-to-confiscate-palestinian-lands">undermining the 1993 Oslo Accords</a>, which called for the freezing of settlements and a mutually negotiated two-state solution.</p><p>Today, roughly 10 percent of Israel’s Jewish population, totalling between 600,000 and 750,000 people, live in about 250 settlements and outposts dispersed throughout the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.</p><p>Many of these settlements are located near Palestinian population centres, often leading to increased tensions and restrictions on movement for Palestinians.</p><p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/INTERACTIVE-Occupied-West-Bank-settlement-expansion-1743158479.png?resize=770%2C962&amp;quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE - Occupied West Bank - settlement expansion-1743158479"></p></div></div>

<div> <p>Computer inputs are not just limited to keyboards and mice. We can use sensors to measure light levels, acceleration, and perhaps our brain! Ildar Rakhmatulin's PiEEG project, last seen <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/control-a-raspberry-pi-with-your-mind-and-pieeg">back in 2023</a>, now comes in the form of the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pieeg-kit-bioscience-lab-in-home/coming_soon" target="_blank">PiEEG Bio Lab</a> with everything that you need to read and analyze your brain and body signals. The project is coming soon on IndieGoGo.</p><div>

These can be used to gather environmental data alongside the EEC, ECG, EMG, EOG data.</p><p>Also present on the board is a "Robot control" interface. This isn't a dedicated series of motor controllers and logic used to control an external robot. Instead it provides a serial interface from which the external robot can receive control signals. This could be a robot arm, controlled via ECG that reads the impulses of your brain and interprets them as movement for the arm. The example video shows a servo-controlled robot arm, and I believe it uses serial servos.</p><p>So what can we do with all of this? The potential applications vary from the already mentioned controlling a robot arm, to meditation, and stress control. The kit can also be used (if you have the skills and resources) to control an exoskeleton or a drone. Basically, if you can connect it up to a Raspberry Pi, then you can connect it up to PiEEG.</p><p>In the video, the kit is being used with a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-5">Raspberry Pi 5</a> (two USB 3.0 ports and the Ethernet port is on the left of the USB ports). It should also be compatible with older models, but your performance may suffer.</p><p>The kit is contained in a case that measures 27 x 17.5 x 6.5cm (10.6 x 6.9 x 2.56 inches) and looks very "medical," with a hard shell and metal clasp to protect the contents. Power comes from an external USB battery of your choosing -- there are no internal batteries supplied.</p><div><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><p><a href="https://github.com/pieeg-club/PiEEG_Kit" target="_blank">Software support</a> is via Python, with an accompanying Python module used to simplify reading and interpreting the data. There is also a supporting Python course to help the user learn more about the signals and how they can be used.</p><p>PiEG Bio Lab is coming soon to Indiegogo and right now we have no details on when it will start. Remember that funding a project on Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, etc is making an investment in a project that may or may not result in a finished product shipped to you. You are not purchasing a completed product.</p>

the largest island on the archipelago and home to the base. </p></div><div><p>Trump said "this land should not be taken away from the UK" and if it did it would be "a blight on our Great Ally", in a post on social media. </p></div><div><p>In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was "crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe".</p></div><div><p>"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base," it said in a statement.</p></div><div><p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.</p></div><div><p>Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.</p></div><div><p>Under the deal - <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9dqg3nqynlo">which was announced last May</a> - the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years at an average cost of £101m a year. </p></div><div><p>Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.</p></div><div><p>The US president's position on the issue has seen rapid U-turns in recent months - from describing the planned transfer as an "act of great stupidity" to saying the deal was <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yx1wedww2o">the "best" the prime minister could make.</a></p></div><div><p>UK ministers <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89y74pvp09o">have previously said</a> that the deal could not go ahead unless it had the support of the US.</p></div><div><p>The bill, aimed at enshrining the agreement into UK law, has been delayed and there is no date set for the next stage. </p></div><div><p>UK Minister Alex Davies-Jones said the bill would return to the House of Lords "as soon as parliamentary time allows".</p></div><div><p>Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: "I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease..."</p></div><div><p>The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was "strategically located in the Indian Ocean".</p></div><div><p>"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before," he said. </p></div><div><p>"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them."</p></div><div><p>And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: "Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the airfield located in Fairford<b> </b>in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime."</p></div><div><p>The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. </p></div><div><p>The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.</p></div><div><p>Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: "The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.</p></div><div><p>"When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies."</p></div><div><figure><p></p><figcaption>Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands deal</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>In a statement, it said it "supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago".</p></div><div><p>Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said: "It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether."</p></div><div><p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: "Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail."</p></div><div><p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: "Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history."</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dad7/live/e22593b0-37e4-11f0-96c3-cf669419a2b0.png.webp" alt="The image shows two maps.

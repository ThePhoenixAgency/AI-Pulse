<p>Two title contenders are set to go head-to-head as New Zealand take on South Africa in a Group D clash of the T20 World Cup 2026. Both teams have won their first two matches and sit on four points each. While they're both likely through to the Super 8 – with Afghanistan having lost to both – they'll be eager to win this match and secure the top spot in the group.</p><p>If you're away from home right now you can <a href="http://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=564&amp;url_id=10992&amp;aff_id=3013&amp;aff_click_id=trd-us-1013248758354122991&amp;aff_sub2=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fhow-to-watch%2Fcricket%2Fnew-zealand-vs-south-africa-t20-world-cup-2026-free" target="_blank"><strong>use a VPN to unblock your usual stream from anywhere</strong></a>.</p>

<p>New Zealand have been cruising so far, registering comfortable victories against Afghanistan and the UAE. Openers Finn Allen and Tim Seifert chased down 174 in just 15.2 overs against the UAE in their last game and will be keen to continue their good form against the South African pacers.</p><p>South Africa, on the other hand, are fresh off a nail-biting win against Afghanistan. The match went into a second Super Over, where Keshav Maharaj held his nerve to defend five off the last ball. While Ryan Rickelton and Quinton de Kock have delivered solid performances with the bat, pacer Lungi Ngidi has bagged seven wickets in just two games and will be key moving forward.</p><p>The overall head-to-head record stands in favour of the Proteas, who have won 11 of their 18 matches against the Kiwis. However, the Black Caps have won four of their last five clashes. Everything points toward this being one of the better matches of the tournament so far.</p><p>Keep reading as we explain how to watch the New Zealand vs South Africa in the T20 World Cup from anywhere in the world.</p>

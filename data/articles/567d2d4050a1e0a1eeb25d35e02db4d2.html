  The Rant
</h2>

<p>I'm a freelancer based in France. I invoice clients across the EU. This should be simple. It is not.</p>

<p>Every invoicing tool I've tried — and I've tried a lot — treats Europe as an afterthought. They'll handle USD beautifully, give you a clean American-style invoice, and then completely fall apart when you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>VAT reverse charge</strong> ("Autoliquidation de la TVA" — required for B2B services across EU borders)</li>
<li>
<strong>Intra-community VAT numbers</strong> validated and displayed correctly</li>
<li>
<strong>IBAN/BIC</strong> payment details (not "routing number")</li>
<li>
<strong>Multi-currency</strong> with proper EUR formatting (1.234,56 €, not €1,234.56)</li>
<li>
<strong>Legally compliant French invoices</strong> with all the mandatory mentions</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried Stripe Invoicing. Wave. Invoice Ninja. Zoho. They all assume you're American, or at best, British. The EU VAT system might as well not exist.</p>

<p>So I built my own.</p>

  Meet InvoiceFlow
</h2>

<p><a href="https://invoiceflow-eu.fly.dev/" target="_blank">InvoiceFlow</a> is a free, open-source invoice generator built specifically for EU freelancers. It handles the stuff that other tools ignore.</p>

  The Features That Actually Matter
</h2>

<h3>
  <a name="vat-reverse-charge-done-right" href="#vat-reverse-charge-done-right">
  </a>
  VAT Reverse Charge (Done Right)
</h3>

<p>If you invoice a business in another EU country, you don't charge VAT. Instead, you apply the <strong>reverse charge mechanism</strong> and include the magic words on your invoice. Different countries have different requirements for how this is displayed.</p>

<p>InvoiceFlow handles this automatically. Select your client's country, mark them as a business, and the correct reverse charge text appears. In French. In English. In both if you need it.</p>

<p>This alone took me weeks to get right. The EU VAT directive is... something.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="intracommunity-vat-validation" href="#intracommunity-vat-validation">
  </a>
  Intra-Community VAT Validation
</h3>

<p>You need your client's VAT number on the invoice. But you also need to verify it's valid — HMRC and the French tax authority both require this. InvoiceFlow validates EU VAT numbers against the VIES database so you're not putting garbage on your invoices.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="iban-amp-bank-details" href="#iban-amp-bank-details">
  </a>
  IBAN &amp; Bank Details
</h3>

<p>American tools give you "Bank Name" and "Routing Number" fields. In Europe, we use IBAN and BIC/SWIFT. InvoiceFlow has proper IBAN fields with formatting and basic validation. Your payment details look correct because they are correct.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="multicurrency-that-works" href="#multicurrency-that-works">
  </a>
  Multi-Currency That Works
</h3>

<p>I invoice in EUR, but some clients want GBP or CHF. InvoiceFlow supports multiple currencies with proper locale formatting:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>EUR:</strong> 1 234,56 €</li>
<li>
<strong>GBP:</strong> £1,234.56</li>
<li>
<strong>CHF:</strong> CHF 1'234.56</li>
</ul>

<p>The little things matter. A French accountant seeing $1,234.56 on an invoice will send it back.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="french-amp-english" href="#french-amp-english">
  </a>
  French &amp; English
</h3>

<p>The entire interface works in both French and English. More importantly, the <strong>invoices themselves</strong> can be generated in either language (or both). This matters when your client is German but your accountant is French.</p>

<h3>
  <a name="pdf-export" href="#pdf-export">
  </a>
  PDF Export
</h3>

<p>One-click PDF generation with proper formatting, your logo, and all the legally required mentions. The PDFs look professional — not like someone printed a webpage.</p>

  </a>
  Why This Matters (The EU Freelancer Tax Nightmare)
</h2>

<p>If you've never freelanced in the EU, let me paint the picture:</p>

<ol>
<li>You do work for a client in Germany</li>
<li>You're based in France</li>
<li>You need to issue an invoice with: your French VAT number, their German VAT number, the reverse charge mention in the correct legal language, the correct intra-community service code, no VAT charged (but displayed as 0% with explanation), your IBAN, the invoice in a format your French accountant accepts</li>
<li>You then need to declare this on your French CA3 VAT return, separately from domestic invoices</li>
<li>You might also need to file an EC Sales List (DES in France)</li>
</ol>

<p>Most invoicing tools help with exactly zero of these steps. They give you a blank invoice template and wish you luck.</p>

<p>InvoiceFlow won't file your taxes for you, but it will generate invoices that make your accountant happy and keep you compliant.</p>

<h2>
  <a name="the-tech-stack" href="#the-tech-stack">
  </a>
  The Tech Stack
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ruby on Rails 7</strong> — Server-rendered, fast, simple</li>
<li>
<strong>PostgreSQL</strong> — Invoice and client storage</li>
<li>
<strong>Prawn</strong> — PDF generation (pure Ruby, no headless Chrome needed)</li>
<li>
<strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> — Clean UI</li>
<li>
<strong>Fly.io</strong> — Deployed in Paris (CDG region, naturally)</li>
</ul>

<p>I went with server-side rendering because invoicing doesn't need a SPA. You fill out a form, you get a PDF. Rails is perfect for this.</p>

<p>Prawn for PDF generation was a deliberate choice. Most Rails apps use wkhtmltopdf or headless Chrome for PDFs, but those are heavy dependencies. Prawn generates PDFs in pure Ruby — fast, lightweight, and pixel-perfect.</p>

<h2>
  <a name="who-this-is-for" href="#who-this-is-for">
  </a>
  Who This Is For
</h2>

<p>InvoiceFlow is built for:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>EU-based freelancers</strong> who invoice across borders</li>
<li>
<strong>Solo developers</strong> tired of paying Freshbooks €15/month for features they don't need</li>
<li>
<strong>French freelancers</strong> (micro-entrepreneur or not) who need legally compliant invoices</li>
<li>
<strong>Anyone</strong> who's ever tried to explain VAT reverse charge to an American invoicing tool</li>
</ul>

<p>It's NOT trying to be a full accounting suite. No expense tracking, no bank reconciliation, no payroll. Just invoices, done right.</p>

<h2>
  <a name="whats-next" href="#whats-next">
  </a>
  What's Next
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Client management</strong> — Save client details for recurring invoices</li>
<li>
<strong>Invoice numbering sequences</strong> — Auto-increment with customizable formats (2024-001, etc.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Recurring invoices</strong> — Set it and forget it for retainer clients</li>
<li>
<strong>More EU languages</strong> — German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch</li>
<li>
<strong>E-invoicing (Factur-X)</strong> — France is mandating electronic invoicing starting 2026</li>
</ul>

<p>That last one is a big deal. France is rolling out mandatory e-invoicing for all businesses, and most tools aren't ready. I plan to have Factur-X support before the deadline.</p>

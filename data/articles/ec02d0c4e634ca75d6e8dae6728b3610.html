Terms of the settlements were not disclosed.</p></div><div><p>Lawyers for K.G.M. or Kaley, who started using Instagram and YouTube as a child, have accused social media firms of working to addict young users, despite being aware of risks to mental health. </p></div><div><p>She attended the proceedings on Wednesday, sitting directly across from Zuckerberg, who arrived at court with an entourage of security and associates. </p></div><div><p>Bereaved parents were also among those in the courtroom to watch the proceedings.</p></div><div><p>Mark Lanier, representing K.G.M., pressed Zuckerberg about his efforts to get users to spend more time on his platforms, confronting the executive with emails he had written.</p></div><div><p>In 2015, for example, Zuckerberg told a group of executives that his goals for the year included seeing "time spent increase by 12%" and the "teen trend be reversed."</p></div><div><p>A year earlier he had identified time spent as "the most concerning" metric being tracked by the company.</p></div><div><p>Gesturing to his client, Lanier noted that the emails were written when she was only nine or 10 years old, and already using Instagram.</p></div><div><p>Zuckerberg admitted that "at an earlier point in the company" he would give executives goals to increase time spent, while also insisting that was no longer how the company operated.</p></div><div><p>He also said that if something is of value, "people tend to use it more."</p></div><div><p>Lanier noted that people who are addicted to something also tend to increase their use.</p></div><div><p>"I don't know what to say to that," Zuckerberg replied. "I think that may be true but I don't know if that applies here."</p></div><div><p>In questioning last week, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, challenged the idea of social media addiction, arguing that even <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn71mgmzljlo">16-hours of Instagram use</a> in a single day did not show an addiction.</p></div><div><p>The trial is expected to last several weeks. It is also set to include testimony from former Meta employees who have since spoken out about on the company's practices.</p></div><div><p>YouTube boss Neal Mohan had also been expected to appear but is no longer being called for testimony, the BBC has learned.</p></div><div><p>The case is one of thousands of similar lawsuits brought by families, state prosecutors and school districts currently winding their way through US courts.</p></div><div><p>The lawsuits accuse Meta and other social media platforms, including TikTok, Snapchat and Youtube, of functioning in an addictive manner that ultimately has harmed many children.</p></div><div><p>In one such case, 29 state attorney generals are pushing a California federal court to demand that the platforms make a number of changes immediately, before any trial, including forcing Meta to remove all accounts known to belong to users under 13 years of age.</p></div><div><p>A growing number of countries are moving to restrict social media use by young people. Australia late last year implemented a ban on social media accounts for people under age 16. </p></div><div><p>The UK, Denmark, France and Spain are considering similar measures.</p></div></article></div></div>

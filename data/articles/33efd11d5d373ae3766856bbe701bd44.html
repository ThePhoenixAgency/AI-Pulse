It was very difficult to see as a coincidence, he said, adding that "it is a Russian way of acting that we recognise from other places".</p></div><div><p>French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, who was with Kristersson on board the aircraft carrier on Friday, praised Stockholm's handling of the incident.</p></div><div><p>"If indeed... there is a potential Russian origin for this incident, the only conclusion I would draw is that it would be a ridiculous provocation," he told reporters.</p></div><div><p>Both armed forces have played down the drone incident, and French General Staff spokesman Col Guillaume Vernet said it had demonstrated the "robustness" of the Swedish response, adding that it had no impact on the French mission.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/454d/live/35ad2980-13c2-11f1-8c68-835571867502.jpg.webp" alt="AFP via Getty Images A large ship moored at a quay in Malmo in Sweden"><span>AFP via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The Charles de Gaulle, equipped with Rafale fighter jets, has never docked in Sweden before</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>A French ex-military commander at the UN, Gen Dominique Trinquand, said if it was a Russian drone off Malmo then it was not surprising that Moscow was conducting intelligence operations in the area. </p></div><div><p>"That they would do so while the French aircraft carrier is deployed there is certainly a strategic signal," he told French media.</p></div><div><p>The Charles de Gaulle has its own naval escort and carries Rafale fighter jets and reconnaissance planes on board, but relies on a host nation for defence while in its territorial waters.</p></div><div><p>The carrier strike group's arrival in Sweden signals a change in France's military focus towards its Nato allies in Northern Europe. </p></div><div><p>Under a mission called La Fayette 26, the Charles de Gaulle will take part in several long-planned Nato exercises in the Baltic and in the Atlantic, off the coast of Norway. </p></div><div><p>Its mission is being seen as a response to Moscow after a lengthy period of Russian hybrid warfare.</p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, Sweden's coast guard has opened an investigation into a fuel spill in the port of Malmo, where two oil tankers are docked, as well as the Charles de Gaulle.</p></div><div><p>The oil spill was detected on Thursday and although the cause is not yet known, the port has told Swedish media it is not linked to the aircraft carrier.</p></div></article></div></div>

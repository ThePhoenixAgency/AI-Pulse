  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>One week ahead of the fourth anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, United States-led peace talks in Geneva ended for the day earlier than scheduled on Wednesday.</p><p>The talks, which are being mediated by Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, are just the latest of a number of attempts to end the deadliest fighting in Europe since World War II – and none have reached a breakthrough.</p><p>During his presidential campaign in 2024, Trump claimed repeatedly that he would broker a ceasefire in Ukraine within “24 hours”. However, he has been unable to fulfil this promise.</p><p>Here is a timeline of the mediation efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war, which has killed more than a million people, as it heads towards its fifth year.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/epa_6990802e39b4-1771077678.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C515&amp;quality=80" alt="epa12734009 Ukrainian rescuers work at the site of a Russian strike on a private residential building in Kramatorsk, Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, late 12 February 2026, amid the ongoing Russian invasion. At least four people died, including one child, and four others were injured as a result of that strike, according to the State Emergency Service.

Nothing came of their talks.</p><p>Then, the two sides held three rounds of direct talks in Belarus, ending on March 7, but, again, nothing was agreed.</p><h2>March-April 2022 – regional talks in Antalya</h2><p>On March 10, the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia, Dmytro Kuleba and Sergey Lavrov, met for the first time since the war started, on the sidelines of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkiye.</p><p>A second meeting between senior leaders in Istanbul towards the end of the month failed to secure a ceasefire.</p><p>Then, the withdrawal of Russian forces in early April from parts of Ukraine revealed evidence of massacres committed against the Ukrainian civilian population in Bucha and Irpin near Kyiv, in northern Ukraine.</p><p>Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this would make negotiations much more difficult, but that it was necessary to persist with the dialogue. Russian President Vladimir Putin later declared the negotiations were at a “dead end” as a result of Ukraine’s allegations of war crimes.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22T232155Z_978282776_RC2NX5AH3U48_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-BRITAIN-GRAINS-1729709077.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80" alt="Ukrainian soldier with machine gun"><figcaption>A serviceman of Ukraine’s coast guard mans a gun on a patrol boat as a cargo ship passes by in the Black Sea, amid Russia’s attack on Ukraine, February 7, 2024 [Thomas Peter/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2>July 2022 – Black Sea Grain Initiative, Istanbul</h2><p>In July 2022, the Black Sea Grain Initiative was signed by Ukraine and Russia with Turkiye and the United Nations in Istanbul. It was the most significant diplomatic breakthrough for the first year of the war.</p><p>The agreement aimed to prevent a global food crisis by designating a safe maritime humanitarian corridor through the Black Sea for cargoes of millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukrainian ports.</p><h2>November 2022 – Ukraine’s peace plan</h2><p>Ukraine’s Zelenskyy presented a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/12/28/what-is-zelenskyys-10-point-peace-plan">10-point peace proposal</a> at the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Indonesia, within which he called for Russia’s withdrawal from all Ukrainian territory as well as measures to ensure radiation and nuclear safety, food security, and protection for Ukraine’s grain exports.</p><p>He also demanded energy security and the release of all Ukrainian prisoners and deportees, including war prisoners and children deported to Russia.</p><p>Russia rejected Zelenskyy’s peace proposal, reiterating that it would not give up any territory it had taken by force, which stood at about one-fifth of Ukraine by then.</p><h2>February 2023 – China’s peace plan</h2><p>China proposed a 12-point peace plan calling for a ceasefire and the end of “unilateral sanctions” that had been imposed by Western nations on Russia. Beijing urged both sides to resume talks on the basis that “the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries must be effectively upheld”.</p><p>The proposal was criticised by Western allies of Kyiv for not acknowledging “Russia’s violation of Ukrainian sovereignty”.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ap_6990614a70e5b-1771069770.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80" alt="Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addresses the audience during a session at the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, Saturday, Feb. 14, 2026.

But Russia was not invited, and the Kremlin said the efforts would fail.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/afp_698e4a520869-1770932818.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80" alt="People walk among debris of a local market close to damaged residential building at the site of a Russian attack in Odesa on February 12, 2026, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The summit focused on nuclear safety, food security and prisoner exchanges, though Russia was not invited, and several nations, including India and Saudi Arabia, did not sign the final joint communique.</p><h2>February 2025 – Trump-Putin call</h2><p>A month after beginning his second term as US president, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he held a long phone call with his Russian counterpart, Putin, in a bid to restart direct negotiations aimed at ending the war.</p><p>On February 18, delegations from Washington and the Kremlin, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>They laid the groundwork for future negotiations, but the talks raised significant concerns in Kyiv and Brussels, as both Ukraine and the European Union had been sidelined from the meeting.</p><h2>February 2025 – Zelenskyy goes to the White House</h2><p>Ten days later, on February 28, there came a saturation point at the White House.</p><p>In one of the most <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/28/key-takeaways-from-the-fiery-white-house-meeting-with-trump-and-zelenskyy">confrontational moments</a> in modern diplomacy, President Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated President Zelenskyy in a televised meeting in the Oval Office.</p><p>Zelenskyy – called out for not wearing a suit and not expressing enough gratitude to the US – found himself cornered.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25059635058455-1740765229.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;quality=80" alt="Zelenskyy and Trump in the Oval Office surrounded by cameras"><figcaption>President Donald Trump, right, meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office at the White House, Friday, February 28, 2025, in Washington, DC [File: Mystyslav Chernov/AP]</figcaption></figure><h2>August 2025 – Witkoff goes to Moscow</h2><p>Trump envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Moscow to meet Putin on August 6. It was his third trip to Moscow and came amid renewed Western threats of sanctions on Russian oil exports and US threats of “secondary” trade tariffs.</p><p>Trump said afterwards that the meeting was “highly productive” and that “everyone agrees this war must come to a close”. Nothing more concrete came out of this meeting, however.</p><h2>August 15, 2025 – Alaska summit</h2><p>Trump dropped his sanctions threat and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/16/no-deal-at-trump-putin-meeting-key-takeaways-from-alaska-summit">met Putin in person</a> on August 15, 2025, at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska.</p><p>But no deal was reached.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-15T200532Z_2137690573_RC2R7GAT6HDG_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-SUMMIT-1755412365.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C514&amp;quality=80" alt="Week in Pictures"><figcaption>US President Donald Trump stands with Russian President Vladimir Putin as they meet to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 15, 2025 [File: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters]</figcaption></figure><h2>August 18, 2025</h2><p>Trump hosted Zelenskyy and other European leaders in Washington and said he would ask Putin to agree to a trilateral summit.</p><p>But nothing came out of this visit, either.</p><h2>November 2025 – Geneva talks</h2><p>In November 2025, the Geneva talks became a flashpoint for Western unity, as the Trump administration’s controversial <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/21/trumps-28-point-ukraine-plan-in-full-what-it-means-could-it-work">28-point plan</a> leaked to the press, reportedly involving a cap on Ukraine’s military and a freeze on NATO membership. It also suggested that Ukraine should cede territory to Russia.</p><p>Reportedly authored by US envoy Witkoff along with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, the draft sparked accusations that the US was drafting a “capitulation” for Ukraine.</p><p>No deal was reached after revisions were made to the draft proposal.</p><figure><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-11T113247Z_340113735_RC2MDIA7YESV_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-KHARKIV-REGION-1765549235.jpg?w=770&amp;resize=770%2C548&amp;quality=80" alt="Servicemen of the 13th Operative Purpose Brigade 'Khartiia' of the National Guard of Ukraine prepare targets with images depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin during shooting practice between combat missions, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kharkiv region, Ukraine December 10, 2025.

But the issues around sovereignty over Ukraine’s Donbas region and the exact line of demarcation proved impossible to bridge.</p><p>And no deal was reached.</p><h2>January 2026 – Abu Dhabi talks</h2><p>On January 23, high-level delegations from the US, Ukraine and Russia sat face to face to hold trilateral talks for the first time since the 2022 invasion.</p><p>Hosted at the Al Shati Palace in Abu Dhabi, talks were mediated by the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>Another round of talks was held on February 4, reaching an agreement on a major <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/12/30/ukraine-russia-swap-hundreds-of-pows-in-deal-mediated-by-uae">prisoner exchange</a> but leaving key political and security issues unresolved.</p><p>The delegations agreed to exchange 314 prisoners of war – 157 each – the first such swap in five months.</p><p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/INTERACTIVE-WHO-CONTROLS-WHAT-IN-UKRAINE-1771420401.png?quality=80" alt="INTERACTIVE-WHO CONTROLS WHAT IN UKRAINE-1771420401"></p><h2>February 17-18, 2026: Geneva talks</h2><p>Talks in Geneva are currently under way.</p><p>Senior military figures from both Ukraine and Russia have attended the second three-way effort, along with the US, to end the war in Ukraine. These have largely stalled so far due to Russia’s insistence on keeping territory it has seized from Ukraine.</p></div></div>

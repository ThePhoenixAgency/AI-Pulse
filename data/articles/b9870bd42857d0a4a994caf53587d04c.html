It's the Lenovo Legion 5i currently on sale as part of the official Lenovo Store's doorbuster event for $1,299 (was $2,034.99).A gaming laptop with an RTX 5070 graphics card and Ryzen 7 chipset for $1,299, what's so good about that? Well, you can currently use the codes BUYMORELENOVO and EXTRAFIVE at checkout to further knock the price down to just $1,194.99.Today's best RTX 5070 gaming laptop dealSee more: check out all of today's laptop deals at LenovoThis particular deal is just one of many available today, but it's probably my favorite from the hundreds of listings that I've checked this past week or so. It's just hitting that sweet spot in terms of value - although, admittedly, it's not the cheapest machine on the market currently.It's also a machine that we haven't personally reviewed here at TechRadar. We have reviewed the slightly higher-end Legion 7i, however, and we thought that was a great gaming laptop. Our sister site TomsGuide has also got a fantastic review of the Legion 5i that's well worth checking out if you want a full run-down of the machine.

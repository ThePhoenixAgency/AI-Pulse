<p>I think I may have just spotted the gaming laptop deal to end all gaming laptop deals this Presidents' Day. It's the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/lenovo">Lenovo</a> Legion 5i currently on sale as part of the official Lenovo Store's doorbuster event<a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=trd-us-8128968771231369475&amp;sharedId=trd-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5i-15-1-WQXGA-Laptop-Core-i9-14900HX-16GB-1TB-NVIDIA-GN22-X6-83LY0007US%2F14451162676%3FclassType%3DREGULAR%26athbdg%3DL1300%26from%3D%2Fsearch" target="_blank"> for $1,299 (was $2,034.99)</a>.</p><p>A gaming laptop with an RTX 5070 graphics card and Ryzen 7 chipset for $1,299, what's so good about that? Well, you can currently use the codes <strong>BUYMORELENOVO</strong> and <strong>EXTRAFIVE </strong>at checkout to further knock the price down to just $1,194.99.</p><h2>Today's best RTX 5070 gaming laptop deal</h2><ul><li><strong>See more:</strong> <a href="https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/221109/218864/3808?subId1=trd-us-2143758349183745820&amp;sharedId=trd-us&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fd%2Fdeals%2Fdoorbusters%2F" target="_blank">check out all of today's laptop deals at Lenovo</a></li></ul><p>This particular deal is just one of many available today, but it's probably my favorite from <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gaming-laptops/ive-looked-through-hundreds-of-gaming-laptops-today-these-are-the-8-best-deals-at-walmart-dell-lenovo-and-other-retailers">the hundreds of listings that I've checked</a> this past week or so. It's just hitting that sweet spot in terms of value - although, admittedly, it's not the cheapest machine on the market currently.</p><p>It's also a machine that we haven't personally reviewed here at TechRadar. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gaming-laptops/lenovo-legion-7i-gen-10-review">We have reviewed the slightly higher-end Legion 7i</a>, however, and we thought that was a great gaming laptop. Our sister site TomsGuide <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/gaming-laptops/lenovo-legion-5i-gen-10-review" target="_blank">has also got a fantastic review of the Legion 5i </a>that's well worth checking out if you want a full run-down of the machine.</p>

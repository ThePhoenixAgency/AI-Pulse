He gave no details, but included an image showing bodies being unloaded from a truck. </p></div><div><p>Hours later, Ukraine said it had received 1,000 bodies which, "according to prior information from the Russian side, may belong to Ukrainian defenders".</p></div><div><p>The two sides have exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the conflict that began with Putin's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. </p></div><div><p>The exchange is based on an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in June 2025. Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of up to 6,000 soldiers each, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25.</p></div><div><p>Kyiv and Moscow regularly publish estimates of the other side's losses, but do not detail their own.</p></div><div><p>And from public sources, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 186,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine. The true death toll is generally accepted to be much higher, as many deaths on the battlefield are not recorded.</p></div><div><p>So even though estimates suggest more Russians are dying every day, Moscow has returned more bodies to Ukraine overall than it has received. </p></div><div><p>No-one has explained the discrepancy, even though Russia has previously accused Ukraine of not abiding by the Istanbul agreement, and Ukraine has alleged Russian body returns were irregular and sometimes included Russians' remains - a charge Moscow has rejected.</p></div><div><p>One possible explanation is that Russia captures more Ukrainian bodies given its troops have been on the attack most of the time and, therefore, more able to retrieve them from the battlefield.</p></div><div><p>On the eve of the Geneva talks, President Zelensky had a telephone conversation with Trump and said he expected the Geneva meeting would lead to trilateral negotiations at the beginning of March - thus creating "an opportunity to move talks to the leaders' level". </p></div><div><p>"President Trump supports this sequence of steps," Zelensky said, adding: "This is the only way to resolve all the complex and sensitive issues and finally end the war." </p></div><div><p>Putin, for his part, has refused to meet Zelensky, describing him as illegitimate - an argument centring on the fact that no presidential election has been held in Ukraine, despite the expiry of Zelensky's term in March 2024.</p></div><div><p>However, Ukraine's constitution bars holding elections under martial law - imposed in the wake of Putin's invasion of his neighbour.</p></div></article></div></div>

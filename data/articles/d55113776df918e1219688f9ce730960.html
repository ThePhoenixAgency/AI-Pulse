    <div><p> PRESS REVIEW – Monday, February 16: We look at reactions in France after the death of Quentin Deranque, a French activist close to the far right. He died of his injuries after being attacked at a protest over a speech given by a far-left MEP at Lyon's political science university. Also, five countries including Britain are mulling extra sanctions on Russia over a report that a deadly frog toxin killed Alexei Navalny. Plus: Olympics records tumble for France, Norway, Italy and Great Britain at the Winter Games. </p><div> <p>We start with the death of Quentin Deranque, a young activist close to the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/far-right/" target="_self">far right</a> in France. Deranque, a 23-year-old far-right nationalist activist, was beaten by a mob on Thursday during a <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/protest/" target="_self">protest</a> against far-left politician Rima Hassan at Lyon's political science university. He died a day later of his injuries. As <strong>Le Figaro </strong>reports, the French government says ultra-left activists were behind his killing.&nbsp;The editor of Le Figaro says that in this tragedy, Quentin was "not a militant killed in a street fight but a martyr for freedom of expression." This is something that the far left wants to replace with its "hideous pack mentality", he claims. The right-wing daily accuses the far-left <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france-unbowed/" target="_self">France Unbowed</a> party of "feeding the political violence that was at the heart of this deadly event." Business paper <strong>Les Echos </strong>says February 14, the date of Quentin's death, will mark a "turning point in <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/french-politics/" target="_self">French politics</a> – that extremism kills." Also, the editor says, it will be a date to remember, 15 months before the French <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/presidential-elections/" target="_self">presidential elections</a>.</p> <p>From the left-wing papers:&nbsp;<strong>Libération </strong>condemns the "unbearable climate of intolerance in which French politics has been conducted for a long time now". Communist paper <strong>L'Humanité </strong>shares that vision. It sees Quentin's death as a "climax of political violence" and a tragedy that is "shamefully being manipulated politically".</p> <p>Also in the headlines, five European nations are considering extra sanctions against <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/russia/" target="_self">Russia</a> in the wake of new information around opposition leader <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/alexei-navalny/" target="_self">Alexei Navalny</a>'s death. British paper <strong>Metro </strong>relays a statement from the British Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper, who said the UK would likely be imposing new sanctions on Russia. A European investigation showed that the 47-year-old Russian opposition leader, who died in prison exactly two years ago today, was killed by a dart frog toxin administered to him. Russia has always maintained that he died of natural causes.</p> <p>Staying with <strong>Metro</strong>, the paper headlines on records tumbling for Great Britain at the Winter Olympics as it celebrates its most successful Winter Games campaign in history. Team GB picked up its first gold medal on snow, thanks to Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale who won the mixed team snowboard cross. But it turned out to be a legendary day, with Team GB winning a second medal of the day in the skeleton event, bringing its gold tally to three. <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france/" target="_self">France</a>, too, has beaten its medal tally record from four years ago. It stands at 15 medals, with one more week to go, <strong>L'Equipe </strong>says on its front page. Host nation <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/italy/" target="_self">Italy</a> already has its biggest medal haul of all time, with 22. Italian skier Federica Brignone picked up her second gold medal in the giant slalom three days after winning her first in the super-G.</p> <p>The Games have also cemented an all-time champion.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/norway/" target="_self">Norway</a> pays tribute to cross-country skier Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo. He picked up his fourth fold medal this weekend, helping Norway to gold in the cross-country skiing men's team relay event. With nine gold medals, he is now the all-time gold medal leader in the history of the Winter Olympics. <strong>Dagbladet, </strong>the Norwegian newspaper says: "No one stands next to him or above him."</p> <p>Finally, the <strong>Guardian</strong> has tested a new <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/fashion/" target="_self">fashion</a> trend that is less than glorious.&nbsp;Thanks to Rich Pelley, you do not have to test the new Crocs/Lego contraption. These clunky Lego shoes or Jenga towers, as he calls them, retail at £200.&nbsp;After a day in the "Jenga towers", he realised they are not shoes but a "performative art piece". Perhaps they would best be in a gallery and not a shoe shop!</p> <p><em>You can catch our press review every morning on France 24 at 7:20am and 9:20am (Paris time), from Monday to Friday.</em></p> </div></div>

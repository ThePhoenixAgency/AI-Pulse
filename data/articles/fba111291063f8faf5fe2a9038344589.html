    <pre><code>We are heading into President’s Day weekend with Amazon’s wide-ranging sale in full swing alongside ongoing price drops on AirPods Pro 3 and more. We also adding a chance to score 32GB 13-inch M4 MacBook Air at $250 off (as opposed to the 15-inch we had earlier this week), alongside a look at the best deals on M5 MacBook Pro configs – most affordable 24GB at $250 off and upgraded models at $300 off. Today has ushered in the first chance to save on the brand new AirTag 2, open-box AirPods 4 down at $60, and a giant discount on Mophie’s AirPods Max Dual Magnetic Charging Stand at $55. Scope it all out down below.&nbsp; Amazon 2026&nbsp;President’s Day sale now live! Apple Watch, AirPods, Google Pixel, Anker gear, much more The official 2026 Amazon President’s Day sale is&nbsp;now live. Giving folks a 5-day head start on President’s Day proper come Monday, Amazon has now flipped over to its&nbsp;annual sale, featuring deals on Apple Watch, Beats headphones, even deeper discounts on Google Pixel 10 gear, a host of its in-house tech – Echo gear, Ring smart, Blink – and&nbsp;much more.&nbsp; Apple’s 32GB 13-inch M4 MacBook Air also now seeing a notable $250 price drop &nbsp;We recently spotted some of the best prices ever on heavily upgraded 15-inch M4 MacBook Air models and, while those deals are now gone, B&amp;H is serving up a solid $250 price drop on this 13-inch 32GB model M4 Air for even less.
B&amp;H is now offering the 13-inch M4 MacBook Air with 32GB of RAM and the 1TB SSD down at $1,549 shipped. This is a regularly $1,799 configuration that is now $250 off the list price for the lowest price we can find online from a reputable authorized Apple dealer. This is even less than B&amp;H is charging for the 32GB/512GB model right now
This configuration, for the record, is not one Amazon sells – you can find 16GB and 24GB models at Amazon right now at$150 off the list price, but nothing with 32GB of RAM or with a deal as deep as we have here this morning. These more affordable models are $150 at Amazon right now, but they were as much as $250 off for the holidays last year: 13-inch M4 MacBook Air from $849 at Amazon ($150 off)
15-inch M4 MacBook Air from $1,049 at Amazon ($150 off) Over the last three days, B&amp;H was offering the 32GB/1TB 15-inch M4 MacBook Air with as much as $300 in savings. That’s a seriously notable, needless to say, but the 13-incher wasn’t included here.&nbsp;
Today, however, we have a relatively rare chance at a notable price drop – one on par with the best discounts we saw at Amazon over Black Friday last year when all of the models it sells were $250 off – on a 32GB model for power hungry folks not looking to spend MacBook Pro money on machine with this much RAM. Most affordable 24GB M5 MacBook Pro now $250 off, 32GB models at $300 off As we head in to President’s Day weekend, and with massive sale events now live at Amazon, Best Buy, and elsewhere, we thought we would take a look at some of the best deals live on Apple’s latest and greatest M5 MacBook Pro. While Amazon is still offering up to $200 off the configurations it offers, some of the best deals can be found over at authorized dealer B&amp;H right now with as much as $300 slashed from the list prices.
Early President’s Day M5 MacBook Pro deals 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro 16GB/512GB $1,449 (Reg. $1,599) 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro 16GB/1TB $1,599 (Reg. $1,799) 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro 24GB/512GB $1,549 (Reg. $1,799) 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro 32GB/512GB $1,699 (Reg. $1,999)
14-inch M5 MacBook Pro 32GB/1TB $1,899 (Reg. $2,199) As you can see in the list above, the first two offers in the list come by way of Amazon with $150 off the base 16GB/512GB model and $200 off the 16GB/1TB. These deals are on par with the lowest we have tracked since the big Black Friday and holiday all-time lows that had both models at $250 off.&nbsp;
The bottom three deals in the list above are from B&amp;H. If you’re looking towards an upgraded configuration, these are the best deals we can find online from a reputable authorized Apple dealer, delivering as much as $250 off the most affordable 24GB configuration you can buy and $300 off a couple of options with 32GB of RAM. The 24GB config here with the 512GB SSD is the most affordable setup you can buy with 24GB of RAM and one you cannot purchase at Amazon – its 24GB model has 1TB of storage and is now on sale at $1,825 from its regular $1,999 list price. First deal on new AirTag 2 live today: 1-pack now down at $24 (Best Buy open-box) While I personally might just prefer to spend the extra $5 and score a brand new AirTag 2, we are tracking the first chance to save on Apple’s brand new item tracker courtesy of an open-box offer at Best Buy.
We did previously see a bundle offer for five of them, but you still had to spend $99 to score it. Today, however, we are seeing the very first chance to save on a single AirTag 2 online.&nbsp; AirTag 2 $29 Or open-box at $24 AirTag 2 – 4-pack $99
AirTag 1 – 4-pack at $64 (Orig. $99) Best Buy is offering a single AirTag 2 down at $23.99 in “excellent” open-box condition. That is only $5 less than buying a brand new one at $29, which, again, may or may not even be worth it for some folks. I certainly would rather a new unit, but every penny counts around here so we wanted to make sure the first chance at some savings on the all-new Apple AirTag 2nd gen was front and center for folks.

This includes AirPods Pro 3 within $10 of the last year’s holiday price, $150 price drops on AirPods Max, and AirPods 4 discounts. But for those of you willing to take a chance on some open-box units, we just spotted the most affordable AirPods 4 selling for $60 via Walmart.
We have already detailed the early President’s Day AirPods deals for you – they are waiting below so you don’t have to go find that post: AirPods Pro 3 $210 (Reg. $249)
AirPods 4 from $100 (Reg. $139 – $179)
AirPods Max (USB-C) $449 (Reg. $549) As you can see, we are looking at straight up $150 price drops on the latest AirPods Max with USB-C alongside a solid drop on the latest and greatest AirPods Pro 3 landing within $10 of the best price we saw before Christmas last year.&nbsp;
The AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with ANC deals are not quite as deep though. We saw some wild price drops on those last year in brand new condition with the new base set at $69 and the ANC model at $99.
With that in mind, today’s open-box offer on the base model AirPods 4 might not seem all that ravishing at $60 shipped – this is only $9 better than the brand new deal last year – but the holiday offers are long gone and we are indeed talking about a set of current-gen AirPods at just $60 after all.
There are a few caveats here: This a third-party seller on Walmart – a good third-party seller with solid reviews, but a third-party nonetheless. The other thing is the warranty info – Walmart states that “most items offer a 30-day free return policy, for added peace of mind” but if you dig into the fine print it appears to be 14-days for electronics. There is also no details under the warranty tab on this listing from the specific seller.&nbsp;
But with that out of the way, we are, again, talking about just $60 for a set of current AirPods here and some folks might want to take the chance to save the $40 over Amazon’s brand new list down at $99 right now, others, not so much. Apple’s latest Blue Trail Loop is up to 30% off right now, Natural finish model at new all-time low Apple Watch Series 11 price drops roll on at $100 off ahead of President’s Day, deals from $299 42mm Apple Watch Series 11 $299 (Reg. $399) 46mm Apple Watch Series 11 $329 (Reg. $429) 42mm Apple Watch Series 11 Cell $399 (Reg. $499) 46mm Apple Watch Series 11 Cell $429 (Reg. $529) Huge price drop hits Mophie’s AirPods Max Dual Magnetic Charging Stand at $55 (Reg. $150) Back in September Mophie debuted a sleek new AirPods Max stand with magnetic charging and auto sleep-wake action at $150. But you can score one at Amazon for a whole lot less than that right now with a sale price sitting down at $54.99 shipped.&nbsp;
Amazon is now offering the Mophie Max Dual Charging Stand for AirPods Max down at $54.99 shipped.&nbsp;
Regularly $150, this is a giant 63% in savings and the lowest price we can find. There has been a few opportunities to score this same stand down at this price previously via third-party Amazon sellers, but this is the first time we have seen it sold down this low directly from Amazon.
As you might know from our launch coverage, this “premium aluminum” stand features a “soft-touch silicone cradle to protect and stabilize your devices,” alongside a magnetic charging dongle for the actual AirPods Max and a secondary wireless charging pad on the base. Magnetic USB-C dongle ensures smooth, hassle-free placement every time for quick charging…Power your AirPods Max headphones and AirPods/AirPods Pro or any Qi-enabled device simultaneously for maximum convenience. With this dongle, the stand provides magnetically-aligned charging for your Apple cans – you just drop them onto the stand to start charging – alongside a built-in sleep mode: Built-in sleep mode conserves battery life by putting your AirPods Max into low-power mode when docked Get a closer look and more details in our launch coverage right here – just make sure you don’t want too long if you’re interested here as the extremely deep sale price could jump back up at any time.

While we did see some configurations jump back up in price recently, as of the time of writing all storage configs and colors are now once again $100 off at Amazon with deals starting from $399.
iPad mini President’s Day deals iPad mini 128GB $399 (Reg. $499)
iPad mini 256GB $499 (Reg. $599)
iPad mini 512GB $699 (Reg. $799) Amazon is now offering a straight up $100 off all iPad mini configs. This includes all three storage options – 128GB, 256GB, and the 512GB – and all four colors of each.&nbsp;
These are the same deals we caught at Amazon nearer the top of the month, but after several of them jumped back up in price it appears Amazon has decided to keep the discounts rolling as part of its President’s Day event through Monday. It is unclear whether or not all of these offers will stay live that long, but appears as though they might, and they are live right now.
We have seen these configs at as much as $120 off a couple times and a one-day Cyber Monday offer at $150 off, but beyond that the offers we have today are on par with the Amazon lows.

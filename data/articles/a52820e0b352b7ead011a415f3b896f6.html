The largest cryptocurrency has lost 1.7% in the past 24 hours and 4.8% since Monday morning.</p><p>The broader CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) fell 2% in a market that, according to Bitwise research analyst Danny Nelson, is mostly driven by fear. Indeed, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has now been in “extreme fear” territory for almost two weeks.</p><p>“The market’s main driver right now is fear. Fear that we’ll go lower,” Nelson told CoinDesk. “In a market like this, good news doesn't register with investors. If they see an exit ramp, they're taking it.”</p><p>To illustrate his point, Nelson pointed to the reaction to Uniswap’s <span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/uniswap"><span><span><span>UNI</span><span></span><span>$3.5157</span></span></span></a></span> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/11/blackrock-takes-first-defi-step-lists-buidl-on-uniswap-as-uni-jumps-25">25% increase </a>after the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock (BLK), said it was making shares of its $2.2 billion tokenized U.S. treasury fund BUIDL tradable on the decentralized exchange. The token has now given back the gains made after that announcement.</p><p>“Sellers bearish on the market's short-term direction overwhelmed the bulls betting that institutional adoption will drive value long-term,” he said.</p><p>Earlier this week, stronger U.S. payroll data and a falling unemployment rate prompted traders to rethink rate-cut expectations for the year. Further guidance may come later today in the form of inflation figures for the world's largest economy.</p><p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January is forecast to show 2.5% year-over-year inflation. </p><p>Adding to that uncertainty is concern over a partial U.S. government shutdown. Odds of that occurring tomorrow are now around 90% on prediction market <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgovtshutdown/will-the-government-shut-down/kxgovtshutdown-26feb14" target="_blank">Kalshi</a>.

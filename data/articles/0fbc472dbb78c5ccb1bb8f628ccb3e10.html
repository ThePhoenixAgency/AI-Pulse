<p>JBL Clip 5</p>
</div>
<div> <p>It’s compact, cost efficient, and sounds pretty good too. Simply put, the JBL Clip 5 is a great value-for-money Bluetooth speaker, and performs well right across the board. This model's rugged design and solid battery life help it to stand among the best speakers in its class, even if its limited confines stop it from sounding the most detailed or impactful.</p>
</div>
<div><div><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Convenient carabiner design</li><li>Regularly on-sale for an unbelievably low price</li><li>Huge array of color options</li></ul></div><div><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Can’t quite compete with UE for battery life</li><li>Bass isn't as impactful as its UE rival</li><li>Wonderboom 4’s soundstage is slightly better</li></ul></div></div>
</div><div>
<div>
<p>Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4</p>
</div>
<div> <p>It almost feels impossible for a Bluetooth speaker as small as the Wonderboom 4 to sound as punchy as it does. This model packs some serious low-end weight, but doesn’t neglect the rest of the frequency range either – sure, it’s not the most nuanced-sounding model around, but it still delivers great sound quality overall. Its battery life and waterproofing aren’t half bad either. </p>
</div>
<div><div><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Incredible bass output for its size</li><li>Beautiful palm-sized build</li><li>Can get considerably louder than the Clip 5</li></ul></div><div><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Costlier than the Clip 5</li><li>Doesn’t support Auracast</li><li>Very limited EQ options</li></ul></div></div>
</div></div><p>Look, I love a hulking boombox just as much as the next person, but sometimes I need a smaller Bluetooth speaker to enjoy my tunes. Yep, whether I’m on the go or taking a shower, I always appreciate having a pocket-sized audio companion at my disposal. So, today I want to compare two of the very <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/wireless-bluetooth-speakers/best-bluetooth-speaker">best Bluetooth speakers</a> in the flyweight class.</p><p>First up, we’ve got the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/wireless-bluetooth-speakers/jbl-clip-5-review">JBL Clip 5</a>. This carabiner style Bluetooth speaker is a real stand-out, combining a practical design with surprisingly strong sonic capabilities. It’s a couple of years old now, but it remains a real favorite of mine and other colleagues here at TechRadar, with some killer features and an ultra-rugged build.</p><p>But it’s got some serious competition. That’s right, I’m pitting the Clip 5 against the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/wireless-bluetooth-speakers/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-4-review">Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4</a>, which is an astonishingly punchy Bluetooth speaker given its mini size. It’s pretty rugged as well, and I’m a huge fan of its eye-catching aesthetic. But is it actually better than the Clip 5? You can find out down below…</p><h2><span>JBL Clip 5 vs Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4: price and availability</span></h2><p>The JBL Clip 5 hit the shelves in June 2024, and came with a list price of $79.95 / £59.99 / AU$89.95. Given that it launched a fair while back, you can often grab the Clip 5 on sale now – I’ve even seen it discounted to under $50 / £40 / AU$65 before.</p><p>It’s a very similar story for the UE Wonderboom 4. It was also released in June 2024, and is regularly on offer for a tasty low price. However, due to its higher power output, it will set you back a little more than the Clip 5. It has a list price of $99.99 / £89.99 / AU$149, although I’ve spotted it going for less than $60 / £60 / AU$90 now and then.</p><h2><span>JBL Clip 5 vs Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4: specs</span></h2><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><span>Row 0 - Cell 0 </span></td><td colspan="1"><p><strong>JBL Clip 5</strong></p></td><td colspan="1"><p><strong>Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Weight</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>0.6lbs / 285g</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>0.9lbs / 420g</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Dimensions</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>3.4 x 5.3 x 1.8 inches / 86 x 134.5 x 46mm</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4.1 x 3.8 x 3.8 inches / 104 x 95.3 x 95.3mm</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Connectivity</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Bluetooth 5.2</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Battery life</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>12 hours</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>14 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Speaker drivers</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>1x 45mm full range</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>2x 40mm active drivers</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Waterproofing</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>IP67</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>IP67</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h2><span>JBL Clip 5 vs Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4: features</span></h2><p>The first category isn’t actually that close. You see, as much as I love the UE Wonderboom 4, I’d be lying if I called it a marvel in the features department.</p><p>Why? Well, above all, it leaves out companion app support – something that’s a bare minimum for speakers in this price range as far as I’m concerned. This means you can’t customize the speaker very much or remotely alter its EQ for instance. Yes, it does have a podcast mode and outdoor calibration, which can be activated with the UE’s onboard button controls, but that’s really it.</p><p>The Clip 5, however, has a nifty app that comes equipped with a custom equalizer as well as a few handy presets. This companion software also enables you to activate <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/speakers/ive-tested-tons-of-bluetooth-speakers-and-this-little-known-jbl-feature-is-a-major-reason-i-recommend-its-products-so-strongly">PlayTime Boost</a> for some extra hours of listening, and has a display for the speakers remaining battery life.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jY8znvrVVEf3CXY8N8D7NU.jpg" alt="A close up of the control buttons on the side of the JBL Clip 5, pictured leaning against a sand coloured rock against a pink background,">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of battery life, both models offer a pretty decent helping here. You get up to 12 hours with PlayTime Boost active on the Clip and 5 – 10 hours without. Meanwhile, the UE plates up 14 hours of playtime, which is very respectable indeed.</p><p>Even still, the JBL does surpass the UE Wonderboom 4 in basically every other area. For instance, both speakers support multi-speaker playback – including stereo pairing if you’ve got two of the same model. But the Clip 5 brings Auracast connectivity to the table, enabling it to seamlessly link up with a ton of other compatible JBL speakers, including the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/wireless-bluetooth-speakers/jbl-grip-review">JBL Grip</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/wireless-bluetooth-speakers/jbl-flip-7-review">JBL Flip 7</a>, and even the rear speakers on the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/televisions/soundbars/jbl-bar-1300mk2-review">JBL Bar 1300MK2</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, the Clip 5’s companion software support, better EQ controls, and Auracast connectivity make it the clear victor in the features department.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VG9yumoYwQ97JF6Wd9xi58.jpg" alt="Buttons on top of the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>JBL Clip 5 vs Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4: sound quality</span></h2><p>OK, so the features head-to-head was a bit of a blow out. But things are going to be <em>way </em>tighter from here on in. Especially because both the JBL Clip 5 and UE Wonderboom 4 are amazing sounding speakers given their limited confines.</p><p>Let’s begin with the JBL Clip 5. It uses a single, full-range 45mm active driver, and has a maximum power output. As you can imagine, this means that it’s hardly the most booming speaker out there – though it does still pack a solid punch, all things considered.</p><p>I was struck by the Clip 5’s talents when playing <em>Copricolori </em>by Marco Castello. In this track, leading vocals were incredibly clean, never smothering keys in the mid-range. The track’s funky bass was well-balanced in the mix too, and didn’t sound sluggish or muddy at mid-volume. Sure, the Clip 5 can’t reach any lower than 95Hz, so don’t expect rippling sub-bass, but mid-bass sounded decently impactful when I sifted through various house tunes.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JJUn8mvsCJPFYHNgoPrCvU.jpg" alt="The JBL Clip 5 in black is pictured leaning against a sand coloured rock against a pink background,">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The UE Wonderboom 4 is a pretty different-sounding model, but it’s also very strong. As soon as I started playing tracks on this thing, I was struck by one thing above all: its seismic low-end output. There’s more of a thump here than the Clip 5 can muster – perhaps unsurprising given the Wonderboom 4’s dual driver configuration and mightier 10W maximum power output.</p><p>Although bass is undoubtedly the main event, that doesn’t come at the cost of enjoyable mid-range or treble performance, though. Don’t get me wrong – you’re not getting the intricate mids that a speaker like the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/wireless-bluetooth-speakers/edifier-es20-review">Edifier ES20</a> can relay, but you’ll experience commendable clarity right across the frequency range.</p><p>So yes, both speakers are top performers in their weight class. But it’s worth noting that neither of these support higher-res Bluetooth codecs, and neither have a 3.5mm port or USB-C audio passthrough for wired listening. As a result, you’re not going to get the most detailed listen imaginable. You’ll also experience compression at top volumes with both the Clip 5 and Wonderboom 4 – that’s pretty common for speakers of this size, but it’s worth noting.</p><p>But which model sounds better? Well, I’d argue that the Clip 5 offers a little more balance overall, and its customizable EQ makes it easier to tailor to your preferences. But even with EQ tweaks, you won’t be able to match the pure bass weight of the Wonderboom 4. Its higher power is also a big plus, and its 360-degree wraparound design helps it to deliver a more engrossing soundstage than the Clip 5.</p><p>Even if bass is the focus on the Wonderboom 4, it still plates up sophisticated mids and highs, resulting in a fun, engaging sound. As a result, UE takes a slight edge for me here.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f5xMWHah7XtSqUvQ563p58.jpg" alt="Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 on table">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>JBL Clip 5 vs Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4: design</span></h2><p>If there was ever going to be a close category, it was going to be this one.</p><p>I think it’s safe to say that there are a fair few similarities between the Clip 5 and the Wonderboom 4 – their numerous colorful variants, their rugged fabric build, and their high standard of build. In fact, both of these models also share an IP67 rating, meaning that they’re fully dustproof and can be submerged in a meter of water without accruing damage for as long as 30 minutes. Pretty cool, right?</p><p>But still, there are a few differences worth exploring, with the most striking being their different forms. The aptly named JBL Clip 5 has a carabiner design, meaning you can attach it to just about anything – a bag strap, a shower hose, a bicycle… you name it. It’s the main thing that sets the Clip 5 apart from other small-sized rivals, and I’m a big fan.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p7EwEBUZLjU5wkausfJWjT.jpg" alt="A close up of the play, pause and volume buttons on the front of the JBL Clip 5, pictured leaning against a sand coloured rock against a pink background,">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The UE Wonderboom 4 takes up a slightly more traditional build. It’s a palm-sized, stubby cylinder that’s simple yet sleek. It has a fabric loop, which you could put on a hook, for instance, but it’s not quite as versatile as the Clip 5. Still, I’d argue that it’s a little more attractive than JBL’s model, with the rounded look and eye-catching button controls making quite the impression.</p><p>With that said, I do still like the look of the Clip 5, and it’s available in a much wider range of colors than its UE rival. Still, both can be purchased in a range of vibrant colorways – or more understated ones if that’s your style.</p><p>For me, the UE Wonderboom 4 is a bit more stylish, but it’s hard to deny the practicality of the Clip 5. As a result, we’ll call this one a tie.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X8UDDekgWY2hnVdwVXCz58.jpg" alt="Man holding the Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>JBL Clip 5 vs Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4: value</span></h2><p>Right then, it seems we’re all tied up in the approach to our fourth and final category: value for money. But before we get into things, it’s worth flagging again that the UE Wonderboom 4 is more powerful, and a little larger too. This means that it’s reasonable to pay a little more for its services.</p><p>And indeed, you’ll almost certainly have to splash a bit more to get your hands on the Wonderboom 4, which typically comes in at around $99.99 / £89.99 / AU$149. Having said that, it is often on sale, and I’ve seen it drop below $60 / £60 / AU$90, which is an excellent price given the raw power of its bass output, its attractive design, and its strong battery life.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Clip 5 comes with a list price of $79.95 / £59.99 / AU$89.95, although it’s discounted almost every time I see it on <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a>, and has been available for less than $50 / £40 / AU$65 in the past. Again, that is a ridiculously good price for such a practical model with brilliant waterproofing, well-balanced sound, and a fleshed-out feature suite.</p><p>So, is it worth spending more on the UE Wonderboom 4? I’m actually quite conflicted. I think that the answer is yes for anyone seeking out more punchy low-end sound and attractive looks. But the lower price of the Clip 5 is incredibly tempting, especially given its inclusion of a companion app and a carabiner for easy fastening.</p><p>OK, the Clip 5 hasn’t got <em>quite </em>as much power, and that low-end kick is a little less prominent. But it still sounds great, and when I look at the speaker as a whole package, I think that lower price gives it the tiniest of advantages over UE.</p><figure><div><p> <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MVUMgWoeK4F6EnpcpRBe9U.jpg" alt="A close up of the USB C charging port on the JBL Clip 5, pictured leaning against a sand coloured rock against a pink background,">
</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>JBL Clip 5 vs Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4: verdict</span></h2><p>It’s very tough to pick between these two, but as I suggested in the value section, I think the JBL Clip 5 just about stands as my overall winner. It just has a few too many one-ups on its UE rival, like a convenient companion app, a practical carabiner design, and Auracast connectivity. It’s also ultra-cheap, but still sounds great, which is no mean feat.</p><p>Having said that, I think the Wonderboom 4 sounds great too – I just wish it had a few more features. It’s an awesome mini model, and if you’re more of a bass-head, I’d perhaps pick this over the Clip 5. In truth, I expect you’ll love either of these speakers, no matter which one you opt for.</p><p>But what do you think? Did I make the right call? Do you want to share your experience with either of these models? I’d be interested to hear your thoughts, so let me know down in the comments.</p><hr><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DTWuJjkYTqwro8ocqm8Em6.jpg" alt="JBL Flip 7"></div></figure></div><hr>

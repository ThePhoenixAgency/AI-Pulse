DEF supports the FCA’s control-based approach in principle but says it must be tied to concrete operational powers, such as the ability to initiate or block transactions, modify protocol parameters or exclude users.</p><p>DEF is an organization focused on informing policymakers and regulators about the benefits of DeFi and has been <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/26/unified-crypto-lobbyists-protect-software-developers-senate-or-we-re-out">one of the prominent lobby groups</a> on the road to crypto regulatory frameworks being established in Washington in recent years.</p><p>The group also challenged the FCA’s framing of DeFi-specific risks, arguing that cybersecurity vulnerabilities are not unique to blockchain systems and that public blockchains offer transparency advantages in combating illicit finance.</p><p>Applying prudential, reporting and platform access requirements designed for centralized trading platforms to non-custodial, automated protocols would be “ill-suited,” DEF said.</p><p>The FCA is seeking to bring a broad range of crypto activities within its regulatory perimeter as the U.K. moves <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/12/20/the-uk-s-crypto-rulebook-is-finally-taking-shape">toward a comprehensive digital asset framework</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Read More: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/12/16/uk-fca-opens-consultation-for-crypto-rules-ahead-of-regulation-expected-in-2027">UK regulators start major consultation on crypto listings, DeFi, and staking</a></em></strong></p></div><div><p><span>AI Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ethics">our standards</a>. <span>For more information, see </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2023/04/14/how-coindesk-will-use-generative-ai-tools">CoinDesk's full AI Policy</a>.</p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>Crypto group counters Wall Street bankers with its own stablecoin principles for bill</p><div><p>16 hours ago</p></div><figure><img alt="The White House, the executive office of the U.S. President (Jesse Hamilton/CoinDesk)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F89b4d3e4c46b2fb171d451be500537464847337a-1920x1080.jpg%3Fw%3D1920%26h%3D1080%26auto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75" /></figure><p>After the bankers shared a document at the White House demanding a total ban on stablecoin yield, the crypto side answers that it needs some stablecoin rewards.</p><div><p>What to know: </p><div><ul><li>The U.S. Senate's crypto market structure bill has been waylaid by a dispute over something that's not related to market structure: yield on stablecoins. </li><li>The Digital Chamber is offering a response to a position paper circulated earlier this week by bankers who oppose stablecoin yield. </li><li>The crypto group's own principles documents argues that certain rewards are needed on stablecoin acvitity, but that the industry doesn't need to pursue products that directly threaten bank deposits business. </li></ul></div></div><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2026/02/13/crypto-group-counters-wall-street-bankers-with-its-own-stablecoin-principles-for-bill">Read full story</a></p></div></div></div>

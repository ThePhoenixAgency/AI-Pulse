<p>Sony WF-1000XM6</p>
</div>
<div> <p>I'll get this in early: if the discussion is purely about sound-per-pound audio quality, the newer Sony WF-1000XM6 new flagship earbuds win things, and that's not easy since the XM5 were also sonically special. They're cheaper than other contemporaneous audiophile-adjacent wireless options and fan-favorite features (Quick Attention, I'm looking at you) remain, which makes them worthy of the Sony branding. But for noise-cancelling efficacy, super clear calls, a truly secure fit and device agnostic spatial audio support, Sony's being somewhat outdone these days. That said, the sound is <em>good…&nbsp;</em></p>
</div>
<div><div><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Sonically expansive and neutral</li><li>Much more secure to grab from the case</li><li>Relatively humbly priced compared to other audiophile buds</li></ul></div><div><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Noise cancelling is better, but still not elite </li><li>Fit can be an issue, and no hearing tests</li><li>360 Reality Audio support is waning</li></ul></div></div>
</div><div>
<div>
<p>Sony WF-1000XM5</p>
</div>
<div> <p>Sony threw everything it could into these bijou earbuds in July 2023, and gave us an extra set of foam tips to make 'em fit – and on this, I prefer the shape of the XM5 to the XM6. LDAC support and the firm's top-tier DSEE upscaler are both here (as they are in the newer set) and the sound is 100% bona fide Sony quality. That said, we experienced a few connectivity drop-outs, average ANC performance, and an app that looks a little busy at this flagship level. And sadly it's those last two elements that haven't really been addressed in the newer set –&nbsp;so a deal on these? Might be the ones. </p>
</div>
<div><div><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Agile, meaty and fun listen</li><li>Very comfortable and secure earpieces – when they're in</li><li>Battery life is the same in XM6</li></ul></div><div><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>ANC can be beaten</li><li>Occasional connectivity issues</li><li>On-ear volume control is a tad hit and miss</li></ul></div></div>
</div></div><p>Historically, that answer has been ‘yes,’ with a rare slight dip in form for the WF-1000XM5. But this time around, due to regional pricing, a smaller-than-expected improvement in key features, and a new shape that could create fit issues, the answer is ‘it depends.’</p><p>To be clear, as TechRadar’s <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/earbuds-airpods/sony-wf-1000xm6-review">review of the WF-1000XM6</a> demonstrates, they’re a great set of earbuds. If you decide to take the plunge, you’ll likely be thrilled with them. But if you already own their predecessors, the Sony WF-1000XM5, or you were about to buy them, read on for a better sense of which model is right for you.</p><h2><span>Sony WF-1000XM6 vs WF-1000XM5: price &amp; availability</span></h2><p>Sony has priced the WF-1000XM6 at $329 / £250 / (about AU$480), and they’re available globally as of February 12, 2026, in Sony’s favorite flagship colors: black and ‘silver’ (which looks more like greige to me). Depending on where you live, this is either good or bad news.</p><p>In the UK and Australia, it’s a small but welcome decrease from the WF-1000XM5’s 2023 launch price of £259 / AU$499. American buyers, on the other hand, aren’t getting any relief from the 2025 price bump that saw the XM5 increase by $30 from their $299.99 launch price.</p><p>However, now that the XM6 are here, we’re seeing discounts on the older model. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> US has them listed as low as $239, and Amazon UK’s current lowest price is £189. That’s a substantial saving if you’re trying to decide between the two models.</p><p>How long do you have to buy the XM5 before they go away for good? Hard to say, but Sony tells me both models will continue to be sold “until further notice.”</p><h2><span>Sony WF-1000XM6 vs WF-1000XM5: specs</span></h2><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><thead><tr><th colspan="1"><p>Spec</p></th><th colspan="1"><p>Sony WF-1000XM6</p></th><th colspan="1"><p>Sony WF-1000XM5</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Drivers </p></td><td colspan="1"><p>8.4mm dynamic with 'soft edge, hard center'</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>8.4mm dynamic driver X: new unique structure combining 'super soft parts within a rigid frame'</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Weight (per earbud, case)</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>6.5 grams, 47 grams</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>5.9 grams, 39 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Number of mics</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>4 per earbud, 8 total</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>3 per earbud, 6 total</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Bluetooth version</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>5.3</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Bluetooth codecs</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>SBC, AAC, LDAC, LC3</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>SBC, AAC, LDAC, LC3</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Battery life per charge, total</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Up to 8 hours (with ANC), up to 24 hours</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Up to 8 hours (with ANC), up to 24 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Fast charging</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>LE Audio</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Auracast</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Wireless charging</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Water/dust resistance (IP rating)</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>IPX4 (earbuds only)</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>IPX4 (earbuds only)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><p>Spatial audio with head-tracking</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes, Android only</p></td><td colspan="1"><p>Yes, Android only</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h2><span>Sony WF-1000XM6 vs WF-1000XM5: features</span></h2><p>As you can see in the specs list above, Sony hasn’t exactly reinvented the wireless earbud with the new WF-1000XM6. In fact, the biggest, most noticeable changes from the XM5 are largely physical — we’ll get to that in a moment.</p><p>All of the features XM5 users have come to appreciate, like wireless charging, speak-to-chat, head gestures, quick attention, and capture voice, have been preserved on the XM6. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been much in the way of innovation. The most notable change is the new Background Music Effect, which first showed up on the headphone version (WH-1000XM6). It gives you three modes: 'My room', 'Living room', or 'Cafe', which spreads and pushes your music just a little further away from your ears each time.</p><p>Far from being a gimmick, our audio editor and reviewer Becky Scarrott found it really enjoyable, noting that it’s an ideal feature for someone who turns the TV on for a bit of background noise, or simply can't concentrate if lyrics are too prominent in their ears.</p><p>Owners of Android phones with support for Gemini can also access this AI hands-free just by saying “Hey <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/google">Google</a>.”</p><p>With an extra mic on each earbud plus new calling and ANC algorithms, you should expect small but noticeable improvements in both noise cancelling and call quality when compared to the previous model. In my testing, I found ANC was better (though still not industry-leading), especially during air travel. Call quality, however, felt about the same.</p><p>Sony says it has also used a new Bluetooth antenna on the XM6, which should create a more reliable connection to your smartphone or laptop (though I personally never had any issues with the XM5, others did).</p><p>More features, in my opinion, are always welcome, but I don’t think any of the XM6’s additions are reason enough to buy the new model.</p><ul><li><strong>Features winner: Sony WF-1000XM6</strong></li></ul><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>3</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R6RDZ7etMvaMxYXL3PBZ8G.jpg" alt="The Sony WF-1000XM6 and WF-1000XM5 side by side in a comparison, on a light wood table "></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Simon Cohen / Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><h2><span>Sony WF-1000XM6 vs WF-1000XM5: sound quality</span></h2><p>Sony says it has done a lot to improve sound quality on the WF-1000XM6, like the addition of 32-bit processing, an enhanced digital-to-analog converter (DAC) amplifier, and a set of newly developed dynamic drivers that use rigid domes combined with soft edge suspension — despite these drivers sounding relatively similar to the older set's on paper, Sony tells me they have been reworked.</p><p>That said, if these new components make a meaningful difference to the sound, it’s beyond my ability to appreciate. The XM6 deliver the same superb sound as the XM5, with powerful and resonant bass, and plenty of clarity and detail in the mids and highs.</p><p>If I were to credit the XM6 with any improvement, it would be in the soundstage, which might just be a tad more defined and slightly wider.</p><p>If you do a lot of critical listening with wireless earbuds and you’re sensitive to even the slightest differences in audio quality, you may want to favour the WF-1000XM6. For everyone else, the XM5 remains a fantastic choice.</p><ul><li><strong>Sound quality winner: (by the thinnest of margins) Sony WF-1000XM6</strong></li></ul><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>3</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipTC9HEaib2zdusTgzRrmF.jpg" alt="The Sony WF-1000XM6 and WF-1000XM5 side by side in a comparison, on a light wood table "></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Simon Cohen / Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><h2><span>Sony WF-1000XM6 vs WF-1000XM5: design</span></h2><p>Say what you will about Sony, but the company is not afraid to shake things up when it thinks change is needed. Each version of the X1000 series has marked a fairly radical departure from the previous generation, and the WF-1000XM6 continue that tradition.</p><p>Size-wise, the XM6 are something of a throwback. Where the XM5 debuted with smaller dimensions than the XM4 (which were criticized for being too big), the XM6 split the difference. The charging case has grown and is less rounded (so slightly less pocketable), but it also feels more robust as a result, with a much sturdier hinge.</p><p>The earbuds are also a little thinner, but taller (though thankfully not as massive as the XM4), and Sony has ditched the XM5’s glossy (and slippery!) plastic in favour of a stone-like matte finish. The combination makes them way easier to remove from their case and less likely to slip from your fingers.</p><p>The new shape isn’t as sleek, but the bigger concern is that Sony’s choice of a lozenge-like oval profile sits differently in your ear, and maybe not in a good way. Strangely, I found the XM6 more comfortable in my left ear than in my right.</p><p>The XM6 are now the third generation to use foam ear-tips. Foam has undeniable acoustic and fit benefits, but foam tips tend to require a deeper insertion into the ear canal than silicone. The XM6’s thinner but longer shape can make this difficult without creating pressure points in the concha.</p><p>Our reviewer speculated that these fit issues may have contributed to her lackluster experience with the XM6’s ANC, which didn’t perform as well as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/earbuds-airpods/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-review">Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2)</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/earbuds-airpods/apple-airpods-pro-3-review">Apple’s AirPods Pro 3</a>.</p><p>Despite the XM6’s beefier overall dimensions, the fact that they’re easier to grab and come in a much sturdier case gives them the edge.</p><ul><li><strong>Design winner: Sony WF-1000XM6</strong></li></ul><h2><span>Sony WF-1000XM6 vs WF-1000XM5: value</span></h2><p>This is where the rubber hits the road. Now that the WF-1000XM5 are priced at a serious discount, Sony needs to justify the XM6’s higher price with a significantly better overall experience, and I’m not sure that’s the case.</p><p>The challenge is that the XM5 were already great. And while it’s true that the XM6 have improved sound quality, ANC, and call quality, each is a small change over what came before. Meanwhile, other key attributes like battery life, water resistance, and spatial audio haven’t improved at all.</p><p>The one entirely new feature — Background Music Effect — is fun and might help you study or focus, but it’s hardly a must-have.</p><p>Then there’s the question of fit. I’m sure there will be those who prefer the XM6’s shape, but I suspect many will find them less comfortable.</p><p>If Sony keeps the WF-1000XM5’s current discount (or deepens it), I think it represents a better overall value than the WF-1000XM6.</p><ul><li><strong>Value winner: Sony WF-1000XM5</strong></li></ul><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>3</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aKyUUbKFQDG3hXnnjA8cxF.jpg" alt="The Sony WF-1000XM6 and WF-1000XM5 side by side in a comparison, on a light wood table "></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Simon Cohen / Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><h2><span>Sony WF-1000XM6 vs WF-1000XM5: verdict</span></h2><p>According to their category wins, the WF-1000XM6 come out on top. And if the WF-1000XM5 and WF-1000XM6 were the same price, I’d feel very comfortable encouraging you to go with the XM6. Though their improvements over the XM5 may be small, they’re real, and for some folks, they may make a big difference (particularly if you had trouble getting a good fit with the XM5).</p><p>However, they aren’t the same price. With savings of up to $80 or £55 over the price of the XM6, Sony’s three-year-old WF-1000XM5 feature almost all of the same perks, sound just as good, and are going to be the better buy for most people.</p><p>So who should spend the extra money on the XM6? Anyone who insists on the improved ANC (even if that might only amount to about a 10% improvement over the prior model), wants that Background Music addition, or hates the idea of dropping a shiny rounded earbud from its case — and I doubt those last two are deal-breakers for many.</p><hr>

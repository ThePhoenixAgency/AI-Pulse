  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <figure> <img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/01/iphone-17-pro-dark.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""> </figure> <p>Apple is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/17/iphone-fold-and-iphone-18-pro-set-to-get-faster-mobile-data/">rumored</a> to have a next-generation C2 chip coming to iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max, shifting away from the Qualcomm 5G modem found in iPhone 17 Pro. Here are three new advantages the Apple-designed modem will bring.</p> <h2>#1: Improved battery efficiency</h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/10/battery-life-iphone-event.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all" alt="Battery life"></figure> <p>Power efficiency has been a consistent advantage of Apple’s C1 and C1X cellular modems. And we’re expecting that trend to continue with the new C2 chip.</p> <p>Because of the tight integration between iOS and Apple silicon, Apple is able to extend battery life over cellular beyond what Qualcomm’s modems offer.</p> <p>How big of gains could C2 enable? It’s hard to know. While Apple credits C1 and C1X with battery life gains across iPhone 16e, iPhone Air, and M5 iPad Pro, the company hasn’t shared specific numbers to date.</p> <p>iPhone 18 Pro is already expected to have an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/06/iphone-18-pro-maxs-new-battery-gains-revealed-by-leaker/">even bigger battery</a> this year than iPhone 17 Pro, and the C2 chip should push gains even further.</p> <h2>#2: ‘Limit Precise Location’ privacy feature</h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/Many-Gen-Z-use-Find-My-and-other-apps-to-share-their-location-with-friend-groups-24-7.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all" alt="Many Gen Z use Find My and other apps to share their location with friend groups 24/7 | Photo shows a hand placing a pin in a map"></figure> <p>iOS 26.3 just <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/11/apple-releases-ios-26-3-for-iphone-heres-whats-new/">launched</a>, and while it’s fairly light on new features, one addition is exclusive to devices with an Apple-designed modem.</p> <p>’Limit precise location’ is a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/26/ios-26-3-adds-new-feature-to-limit-location-data-shared-with-your-carrier/">new setting</a> that allows you to keep your location a bit more private from your cellular carrier.</p> <p>From Apple’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/126101#ntf">official documentation</a>:</p> <blockquote>
<p>Cellular networks can determine your location based on which cell towers your device connects to. The limit precise location setting enhances your location privacy by reducing the precision of location data available to cellular networks.</p> <p>With this setting turned on, some information made available to cellular networks is limited. As a result, they might be able to determine only a less precise location — for example, the neighborhood where your device is located, rather than a more precise location (such as a street address). The setting doesn’t impact signal quality or user experience.</p>
</blockquote> <p>Currently, only iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro with M5 support the feature. But since the iPhone 18 Pro will add an Apple C2 modem, it will join that list.</p> <h2>#3: Better performance in tough data spots</h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/T-Mobile-and-Starlink-team-up-to-offer-satellite-texting-in-LA-where-cellular-service-is-out.webp" alt="T-Mobile and Starlink team up to offer satellite texting in LA where cellular service is out | Wildfires seen from satellite"></figure> <p>Another advantage offered by Apple-designed modems like the forthcoming C2 is that they can offer improved performance when you’re in a spotty coverage situation.</p> <p>For example, Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/14/apples-new-c1-brings-two-killer-features-and-its-just-the-start/">told <em>Reuters</em></a> that “if an iPhone encounters congested data networks, the phone’s processor can signal to the modem which traffic is the most time sensitive and put it ahead of other data transfers.”</p> <p>What’s the benefit? From a user’s standpoint, the iPhone is able to feel more responsive and less impacted by the congestion. This is only possible thanks to tight integration between Apple’s A-class processor and its C-class modem.</p> <p>Which of the C2 advantages in iPhone 18 Pro are you most looking forward to? Let us know in the comments.</p> <h3>Best iPhone accessories</h3> <ul>

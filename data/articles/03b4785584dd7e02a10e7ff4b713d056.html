"We knew that our son did not simply die in prison, he was murdered."</p></div><div><p>Russia has firmly rejected the accusations.</p></div><div><p>"Of course, we do not accept such accusations. We disagree with them, we consider them biased and unfounded. And, in fact, we resolutely reject them," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. </p></div><div><p>Navalny's widow Yulia has also marked the two-year anniversary of his death, writing in a social media post: "We have achieved truth and we will achieve justice one day too." </p></div><div><p>The Kremlin did not comment on her statements at the time. </p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6749/live/aeb0d500-0b36-11f1-89e7-89779f9c687a.jpg.webp" alt="Reuters Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny takes part in a rally to mark the 5th anniversary of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov's murder and to protest against proposed amendments to the country's constitution, in Moscow, Russia February 29, 2020.

He returned to Russia the following year, saying he did not want to "give up either my country or my beliefs". </p></div><div><p>Police arrested him on arrival. Just over a year later, he died in the Polar Wolf penal colony above the Arctic Circle.</p></div><div><p>At the time, the Kremlin said Navalny had died of natural causes. Although the authorities initially refused to release his body, he was eventually buried in Moscow in March 2024.</p></div><div><p>His funeral, which was attended by thousands of mourners who defied fears of a police crackdown, was the last time like-minded Russians gathered publicly. </p></div><div><p>Repression in Russia has steadily intensified over the years, ramping up following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Punitive new laws have been introduced and displays of anti-government stance – whether in the form of street protests or online posts – are routinely met with long prison sentences.</p></div><div><p>Many associates of Navalny have been jailed or have fled Russia.</p></div><div><p>His widow Yulia – who has since taken the helm of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation – also faces arrest, and lives abroad alongside their two children.</p></div><div><p>The Russian opposition in exile is politically fragmented and has struggled to present a united front, with different factions publicly falling out.</p></div></article></div></div>

    <div><div> <p>Two more suspects, a man and a woman arrested this week over the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/a-week-in-france/20251025-search-for-stolen-crown-jewels-as-investigators-piece-together-timeline-of-louvre-break-in" target="_self">jewel heist at the Louvre</a>, were on Saturday charged and remanded in custody, prosecutors said.</p> <p>That brings to four the number of people now charged over the spectacular robbery.</p> <p>The latest to be charged, a 38-year-old woman and a 37-year-old man, were arrested on Wednesday along with three other individuals, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/paris/" target="_self">Paris</a> prosecutor Laure Beccuau said. The other three have now been released without charge.</p> <p>The woman was in tears as she appeared at a Paris court, saying she feared for her children and for herself, an AFP reporter witnessed.</p> <div> <div> <p>To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.</p> </div>

<time>07:32</time> </p> </figure> </div> <p>She has been charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to preparing a crime.</p> <p>The magistrate justified the detention of the woman, who lives in the French capital's northern suburb of La Courneuve, on the grounds of a "risk of collusion" and "disturbance of public order".</p> <p>The man was charged with organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to preparing a crime, the Paris prosecutor said.</p> <p>The individual was known to the judicial authorities for previous theft offences, she said.</p> <p>He has been placed in pre-trial detention pending a hearing to take place in the coming days, the prosecutor added.</p> <p>"Both individuals denied any involvement in the events," Beccuau said.</p> <h2>'Like drift nets'</h2> <p>Last month, thieves wielding power tools raided the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/louvre/" target="_self">Louvre</a>, the world's most visited art museum, in broad daylight, taking just seven minutes to steal jewellery worth an estimated $102 million.</p> <p>French authorities initially announced the arrest of two male suspects over the Louvre robbery, and this week prosecutors said that police had arrested five more people including a main suspect.</p> <p>Adrien Sorrentino, a lawyer for the woman who was remanded in custody, said his client "vehemently" denied the charges against her.</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/video/20251022-louvre-heist-turns-into-political-quagmire-over-museum-s-security-measures" target="_self">Louvre heist turns into political quagmire over museum's security measures</a></p> <p>"She is devastated," he told reporters.</p> <p>"This is a spectacular heist, and the decision that has just been made is a spectacular one: a young woman has just been placed in detention despite being presumed innocent."</p> <p>Sofia Bougrine, a lawyer for one of the people arrested this week but later released, pointed to what she said was the indiscriminate nature of some of the arrests.</p> <p>"In these serious crime cases, we find that waves of arrests look more like drift nets," Bougrine told AFP.</p> <h2>Minister still 'confident'</h2> <p>The first two men arrested earlier were charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after "partially admitting to the charges", Beccuau said earlier this week.</p> <p>They are suspected of being the two who broke into the gallery while two accomplices waited outside.</p> <p>Both lived in the northeastern Paris suburb of Aubervilliers.</p> <p>One is a 34-year-old Algerian national living in France, who was identified by DNA traces found on one of the scooters used to flee the heist. The second man is a 39-year-old unlicensed taxi driver.</p> <p>Both were known to the police for having committed thefts.</p> <p>The first was arrested as he was about to board a plane for Algeria at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.</p> </div></div>

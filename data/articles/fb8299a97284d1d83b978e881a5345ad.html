<p>Much has changed for Jenny Wang, the founder who’s bringing “Clueless” fashion tech to life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Last year, her company, Alta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/alta-raises-11m-to-bring-clueless-fashion-tech-to-life-with-all-star-investors/">raised $11 million in a round</a> led by Menlo Ventures to let users create digital closets and try on their clothes with their own virtual avatars. It’s a tech once seen only in movies, most notably in “Clueless,” where Cher styles and plans her outfits using computer technology. Alta is similar to that, allowing users to plan and style outfits using the latest AI innovations. </p> <p>A slew of big names participated in Atla’s round last year, including models Jasmine Tookes and Karlie Kloss, Anthropic’s VC arm Anthology Fund, and Rent the Runway cofounder Jenny Fleiss.&nbsp;</p> <p>TechCrunch caught up with Wang during New York Fashion Week to talk about <a href="https://www.altadaily.com/">how the company</a> has expanded since that round.</p> <p>For starters, the product is officially in the app store; <em>Time</em> and <em>Vogue</em> named it one of the best innovations of last year, and Wang said more than 100 million outfits have been generated on the platform since its launch in 2023.&nbsp; It has partnerships with Poshmark and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, with more partnerships to be announced soon.</p> <p>“Alta’s own app also features thousands of brands that users can shop from,” Wang said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Right now, the company is focused on building app and website integration experiences for brands, she said, where customers can try on a designer’s clothing using a personalized Alta Avatar. This week, the company unveiled its first integration collaboration, <a href="https://www.publicschoolnewyork.com/">teaming up with Public School</a>, a storied New York City brand.&nbsp;</p>
<div> <p>Techcrunch event</p> <div> <p><span>Boston, MA</span> <span>|</span> <span>June 23, 2026</span> </p> </div> </div> <p>“Shoppers can style looks from the new collection on their own Alta avatar,” Wang said.&nbsp;</p> <p>She met the Public School team — Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne — through the founder of Poshmak, who is also an angel investor in both companies.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Public School designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne had been looking for an AI partner and virtual try-on avatar solution, and Dao-Yi has been an Alta app user himself,” Wang said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Public School actually went on hiatus for a few years, with this NYFW marking its grand re-debut. When asked, the founders of the brand said they rediscovered their voices and what they wanted to say. </p> <p>“We have to look at tech as a partner in the business today,” Chow told TechCrunch, adding, “It’s not 2015 anymore,” so the team wants to take advantage of the latest technological developments. “We want to be thoughtful on how we use tech and AI,” he continued, “not as a design tool but as a tool to extend our storytelling and a tool to interact with the consumer and have them experience the brand even if they can’t do so in person.”</p> <figure><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Public-School.png?w=680" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Alta</span></figcaption></figure> <p>Wang said this is one of the first instances of a designer embedding personal avatar and styling technology into its own website. Near the bottom of Public School’s product page, there is an icon that says <a href="https://www.publicschoolnewyork.com/products/linden-jacket?variant=48139461656831">Style by Alta</a>. Clicking that takes the customer to Alta for them to then style their avatars and test out how Public School clothing would look on them, should they purchase.&nbsp;</p> <p>Users on Alta’s standalone app can also access Public School through Alta’s app. Wang said the goal is for Alta to integrate more experiences like this into other brands and websites, so Alta users can try on clothes on other websites even while outside the Alta app.&nbsp;</p> <p>“Right now, a user would have to add a potential purchase into their Alta wishlist, then style outfits and try on their avatar, versus being able to do that directly on the brand website.” (For every site but Public School, that is.) “The goal is to bring their community on a new journey to engage with and shop the brand.”&nbsp;</p> <p>Many major fashion brands, like Zara and Balmain, have already experimented <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/declaneytan/2018/08/31/balmain-unveils-latest-campaign-starring-cast-of-digital-supermodels/">with digital avatars</a>. Wang said what makes Alta different here, especially compared to Zara, is that Alta avatars can put on at least 8 items within seconds, whereas Zara avatars can wear only four and often take around two minutes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Overall, demand for virtual avatars has increased. Wang considers Alta both still the “Cluless”&nbsp; technology that it started out with, and a digital avatar business.&nbsp;</p> <p>“The consumer Alta app is the ‘Clueless’ closet, while the enterprise Alta experience allows shoppers to style pieces and try the outfits on their pre-existing Alta avatar,” he said. Eventually,&nbsp;Wang said she wants Alta to be the “personal identity layer for the future of consumer AI and shopping.”</p> <p>For agentic commerce to truly work, she said, “We need a data layer that understands the shopper’s style preferences, such as their closet, past purchases, and their avatar, likeness, and body, which is Alta.”</p>

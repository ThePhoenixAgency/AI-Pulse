Apple Watch, AirPods, Google Pixel, Anker gear, much more</a></h2> <p>The official 2026 Amazon President’s Day sale is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/presidentsdaysale?tag=toysj-20">now live</a>. Giving folks a 5-day head start on President’s Day proper come Monday, Amazon has now flipped over to its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/presidentsdaysale?tag=toysj-20">annual sale</a>, featuring deals on Apple Watch, Beats headphones, even deeper discounts on Google Pixel 10 gear, a host of its in-house tech – Echo gear, Ring smart, Blink – and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/presidentsdaysale?tag=toysj-20">much more</a>.&nbsp;</p> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/AirPods-Presidents-Day-deals-01.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1500" alt=""></figure> <h2>Early President’s Day AirPods deals up to $140 off: AirPods Pro 3, USB-C AirPods Max, more</h2> <p>Amazon’s <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">2026 President’s Day sale is now live</a> as of this morning, and Best Buy has now <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">updated its event</a> that launched earlier this week, so we thought it was time to take a look at the best AirPods deals to take advantage of this weekend. The latest <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">USB-C AirPods Max are</a><strong><a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">$100 off</a> </strong>(or as much as $140 off in open-box condition) alongside deals on <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">AirPods Pro 3</a> and more.</p> <h3>Early President’s Day AirPods deals</h3> <ul>
<li>AirPods Pro 3 <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/"><strong>$210</strong> (Reg. $249)</a></li> <li>AirPods 4 <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">from $100 (Reg. $139 – $179)</a></li> <li>AirPods Max (USB-C) <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/"><strong>$450</strong> (Reg. $550)</a></li>
</ul> <p>While prices aren’t quite as low as we were tracking on the latest lineup of AirPods for Black Friday and the holidays last year, there are discounts to be had across the lineup in the lead up to President’s Day 2026.&nbsp;</p> <p>Folks looking to land a set of the latest Apple <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">AirPods Pro 3 can do so down at <strong>$209.99 shipped</strong></a> via Amazon right now. Again, not the lowest we have tracked, but the $185 deal a couple weeks ago came and went extremely fast and today’s offer is within $10 of the holiday Amazon all-time low.</p> <p>Much of the same goes for the AirPods Max – they were as much as $150 off over the holidays last year and we did see some more recent offers on select colors at $130 off, but if you’re looking to land a set this week/weekend, you can grab all five colors at <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">$100 off the list price right now</a> – if <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">Amazon</a> doesn’t have the color you’re after on sale, check <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">Best Buy</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>But for the lowest possible price on the latest AirPods Max, scope out the Best Buy open-box listing in “excellent” condition that has the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/early-airpods-presidents-day-deals/">Midnight set down at<strong> $408.99 shipped</strong></a>, or $140 off the list price right now. They ship with a 1-year Apple warranty, which is the best we can find right now from a reputable source with an Apple warranty.</p> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/Anker-2025-Prime-25W-MagSafe-charging-gear.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1500" alt=""></figure> <h2>Anker’s impressive Qi2 25W 3-in-1 Prime MagSafe Charger w/ Smart Display hits all-time low at $100 off</h2> <p>We recently spotted <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/anke-qi2-25w-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-lowest-price/">Amazon</a> dropping Anker latest feature-packed <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/anke-qi2-25w-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-lowest-price/">Qi2 25W Prime MagSafe Charger</a> down to $160, but Best Buy has now updated its President’s Day sale with the lowest price we have tracked yet at <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/anke-qi2-25w-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-lowest-price/"><strong>$129.99 shipped</strong></a> – that’s <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/anke-qi2-25w-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-lowest-price/">$100 off</a>.</p>
<p>The official Anker store at Best Buy is now offering its latest <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/anke-qi2-25w-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-lowest-price/">Qi2 25W Prime MagSafe Charger with the onboard Smart Display down at <strong>$129.99 shipped</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regularly $230, this is a major $100 price drop, undercutting the current Amazon price drop by $30 to deliver the lowest price we have tracked to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This unit dropped to $150 at Amazon and elsewhere during the massive Black Friday festivities last year, which, up until now, was the best we had tracked online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Amazon is still charging <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/anke-qi2-25w-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-lowest-price/">$160 and $161</a> for this unit in the black and white colorways.&nbsp;</p> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Apple-Sport-Band-Starlight.jpeg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1500" alt=""></figure> <h2>Official Apple Sport Bands/Loops <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/official-apple-sport-band-loop-deals/">up to 41% off right now from $29</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/12/Sport-Loop-Anchor-Blue.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Apple’s Anchor Blue Sport Loop <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/apple-anchor-blue-sport-loop-deal/">deal now live again down at $39 (One size ‘fits most’)</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Apple-Gold-Milanese-Loop-for-46mm.jpeg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Official <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/11/official-apple-gold-milanese-loop-lowest-price/">Apple Gold Milanese Loop hits Amazon all-time low at $60 (39% off)</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Apple-40W-Dynamic-Power-Adapter-deal.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Apple’s 40W <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-40w-dynamic-power-adapter-amazon-deal/">Dynamic Power Adapter delivers ‘50% charge in 20 minutes’ – now at $27 Amazon low</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/iPad-Pro-M5.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Apple’s 11-inch 1TB M5 iPad Pro hits Amazon all-time low today at $150 off</h2> <p>We have caught a couple of opportunities to land the more affordable 13-inch M5 iPad Pro models at $150 off in new condition, however the 11-inch models have rarely sold for better than $100 off. While that remains the case on the 256GB and 512GB storage options at the moment, Amazon is serving up a new all-time low on the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-best-price-amazon/">11-inch 1TB model today at $150 off the list price</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon is now offering <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-best-price-amazon/">Apple’s latest 11-inch M5 iPad Pro in Space Black at <strong>$1,449 shipped</strong></a>. This is a regularly $1,599 configuration that has now dropped to its best price to date at Amazon with $150 in savings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, we have seen the 13-inch models in brand new condition hit the $150 mark more than a few times now, but it has been much more rare on the 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB 11-inch models until today. You will still find the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-best-price-amazon/">256GB starting down at <strong>$899</strong></a>, or $100 off, much like the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-best-price-amazon/">512GB</a>, but the 1TB has now hit its best price ever on Amazon in new condition.</p> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/iPhone-16-deals-2026.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Apple charges $869 for a 512GB iPhone 16 refurb, <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-512gb-iphone-16-refurb-amazon-deals/">Amazon has them at $679 today ($420 off orig. price)</a></h2> <figure><img src="https://9to5toys.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Apple-Watch-Series-11-deals-best-prices-2026.png?w=1600" alt=""></figure> <h2>Still live: <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/upgrade-apple-watch-series-11-2026-best-prices/">Upgrade to Apple Watch Series 11 for 2026 – all GPS models at best prices ever from $299</a></h2> <ul>

While early President’s Day sales have delivered some <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-32gb-m4-macbook-air-best-prices/">$150 price drops</a> on the more affordable lower-storage and RAM tier configs, B&amp;H as a couple of special offers live on <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-32gb-m4-macbook-air-best-prices/">15-inch models at some of the lowest prices</a> to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most notable option here is the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-32gb-m4-macbook-air-best-prices/">15-inch M4 MacBook Air in Sky Blue</a> with 32GB of RAM and the 1TB internal SSD <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-32gb-m4-macbook-air-best-prices/">down at <strong>$1,699 shipped</strong></a>. This is a regularly $1,999 configuration if you purchase it from Apple and it is now $300 off the list price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also find a notable deal on the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-32gb-m4-macbook-air-best-prices/">Midnight black 32GB model</a>right now at <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-32gb-m4-macbook-air-best-prices/"><strong>$1,729 shipped</strong></a> from the usual $1,999 list price. This the same configuration is the one detailed above, just with the Midnight paint job at $270 off the sticker price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the base 16GB and 24GB models you’ll find at Amazon are now <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-32gb-m4-macbook-air-best-prices/"><strong>$150 off</strong></a> ahead of President’s Day <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2026/02/10/apple-32gb-m4-macbook-air-best-prices/">starting from <strong>$849</strong></a>. These are the same deals you’ll find as part of Best Buy sale that launched yesterday, but they are not nearly as good as the $250 off we featured over the holidays last year. Amazon does carry a 32GB M4 MacBook Air at all.</p>
<p>These 32GB offers from B&amp;H, on the other hand, are very good. They are clearly far more niche configs at prices like this, but if you are looking towards a powerful M4 machine it will likely be the better part of year or more after Apple’s debuts the next-generation models before we see price drops like this. Black Friday pricing on the more affordable models maxed out at just over $250 off, a price we have not seen since.</p>

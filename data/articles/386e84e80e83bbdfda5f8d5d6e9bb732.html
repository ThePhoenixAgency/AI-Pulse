    <div><div><article><div><p>Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-18/">iPhone 18</a> Pro and ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max models "won't be a big update," according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27">Mark Gurman</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/o8WxUsBVThZ0ypMkbRoBGPicLSg=/400x0/article-new/2025/09/iphone-17-pro-dark-blue-1.jpg?lossy" alt="iphone 17 pro dark blue 1" /><br />In the latest edition of his "<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27">Power On</a>" newsletter, Gurman said that the ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro models will "represent minor tweaks from last year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and 17 Pro Max." He compared the upgrade to Apple's past practice of appending the letter "S" to its more minor generational <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> releases.</p>
<p>There will still apparently be several important internal changes, such as a new camera system with a variable aperture, the A20 chip, and the custom C2 modem. Nevertheless, the new Pro models likely won't be "the star of Apple's ‌iPhone‌ launch this fall," with the company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">first foldable</a> claiming the spotlight instead.</p>

						<p>Blizzard have released Diablo II: Resurrected – Infernal Edition on Steam, a newly upgraded version of the classic action RPG and it's Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>Oh what joy, I had to grab this as soon as possible as I have such fond memories of playing through it when I was a lot younger. Diablo 2 really is an absolute classic, and holds up really well today. With a few enhancements to it in this new addition like the new Warlock class, an expanded end-game, new items, and various quality of life updates like a loot filter perhaps now it's better than ever?</p>

<p>One thing that should be noted a lot clearer, which is buried in the small-print at the very bottom of the Steam page, is this rather important little notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internet connection, Battle.net Account, and Battle.net desktop app required to play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can hear your groaning from here - but actually, this doesn't seem to be quite correct. The game directly launches with no third-party launcher ever touched. It does note it's signing into Battle.net when you launch to the menu, but other than that it works just fine with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/valve-released-proton-10-0-4-bringing-more-game-compatibility-to-steamos-linux/" target="_blank">the latest Proton 10</a> on Linux.</p>
<p>Even controller support worked <em>perfectly</em> without issues with my PowerA OPS v1, and for someone like me who nowadays prefers the controller but hasn't played Diablo 2 since probably the early 2000s this is just incredible. A real nostalgia trip.</p>

<p>The super easy access via Steam with all the new bits, and it working great on Linux with Proton made it easily worth the purchase for me.</p>
<p>You can see the main changes in the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/article/24243863/rain-annihilation-in-reign-of-the-warlock" target="_blank">Blizzard news post</a>.</p>

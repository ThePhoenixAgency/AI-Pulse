<div><p>Viltrox's fresh take on one of the most popular full-frame portrait lenses is a win for Sony and Nikon photographers. It delivers a level of optical excellence and low-light versatility equivalent to Sony's superb 85mm F1.4 GM II and Sigma's well-regarded 85mm f1.4 Art DG DN lenses, for a fraction of the cost, while Nikon is yet to launch an f/1.4 lens at this focal length. As with its rivals, I wish close-focusing was better, but the major drawback is the Viltrox lens's weight – at 800g it's around 25% heavier. Ultimately, the key choice is between a light weight or maximum value – and given the general use-case for such a lens, I'd err towards the later. </p> </div>

<h3><span>Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro: one-minute review</span></h3><p>I've had a busy time reviewing Viltrox lenses this year – including a range of primes such as the cheap and characterful <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/camera-lenses/viltrox-af-28mm-f-4-5-review">'body cap' 28mm f/4.5 lens</a>, my dream reportage photography <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/camera-lenses/i-tested-the-viltrox-35mm-f-1-2-lab-for-two-months-photo-assignments-will-never-be-the-same-again">35mm f/1.2 lens</a>, the buttery bokeh-delivering <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/camera-lenses/i-tried-the-stunning-viltrox-135mm-f-1-8-lab-lens-for-nikon-and-its-my-new-favorite-portrait-lens-except-for-this-one-drawback">135mm f/1.8 LAB</a> and the lightweight <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/camera-lenses/viltrox-af-50mm-f2-air-review">50mm f/2 Air</a>. Now, it's the turn of the AF 85mm F1.4 Pro.</p><figure><div><p> 

<img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dn3y9Kp8auuJaVJofhJ5uA.jpg" alt="Side barrel of the Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro lens in photographer&amp;#039;s hand, outdoors and with bronze-colored ferns in the background" />
</p></div><figcaption><span>Just 15mm in length – Viltrox AF 28mm f/4.5 is a true body-cap lens, with a much faster f/4.5 aperture than other such optics, including the Panasonic 26mm f/8. If you don't mind something a little larger and pricier, there are f/2.8 alternatives </span><span>(Image credit: Tim Coleman)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the hand, the Viltrox 85mm F1.4 Pro's rugged build quality is immediately evident – this is a weather-sealed metal lens, with a range of external controls for photo and video work, even if it lacks the digital display found in Viltrox's flagship 'LAB' lenses.</p><p>Image quality is top drawer in every regard, too, demonstrating everything you'd hope for in a portrait lens; detail is sharp, bokeh is smooth, lens distortions are minimal. And then comes the mic drop: this lens costs just $589 / £569 / AU$919 – that's a third of the price of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/camera-lenses/sony-fe-85mm-f14-gm-ii-review">Sony's 85mm F1.4 GM II</a>, and almost half the price of Sigma's 85mm f1.4 Art DG DN. It's regularly on sale for less, too.</p><p>Surely we can forget these rival lenses then, and save a packet with the Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro instead? Not quite. At 800g and measuring 108.5mm in length, this is a hefty lens that's a fair bit heavier than rivals. If an 85mm f/1.4 lens is your workhorse optic, it could be well worth forking out extra for a lighter alternative.</p><h3><span>Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro: price and availability</span></h3><ul><li><strong>Available in Sony E and Nikon Z-mount versions</strong></li><li><strong>It costs $598 / £569 / AU$919</strong></li><li><strong>Viltrox regularly discounts its lenses – there's 15% off the AF 85mm F1.4 Pro at the time of writing</strong></li></ul><p>Viltrox's 'Pro' series, which includes the 85mm F1.4 lens, sits between its flagship 'LAB' series, and above its lightweight 'EVO' in terms of both price and quality. At $598 / £569 / AU$919, it's not a cheap lens by any means, and is the priciest of a trio of Viltrox 85mm lenses, with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/camera-lenses/i-took-the-best-pictures-of-my-life-with-a-third-party-lens-that-only-costs-399-usd">an f/1.8</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/camera-lenses/lightweight-razor-sharp-and-budget-friendly-why-im-not-taking-the-viltrox-85mm-f-2-evo-off-my-camera">f/2 EVO</a> also available. That said, the f/1.4 aperture is a better option, especially for pros who work in challenging situations, including indoors and low light.</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><p>The lens is currently available in Sony E and Nikon Z versions, but not L-mount or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/canon">Canon</a> RF (don't expect the latter – Canon has locked Viltrox out. But for reference, Canon's own 85mm F1.4L VCM costs 3x the price of Viltrox's, and for me is <em>very</em> similar).</p><div><p>A fairer comparison for value, then, is against Nikon and Sony's own 85mm lenses, plus lenses from other third parties such as Sigma. Nikon doesn't have a f/1.4 version in its range yet.</p><p>Here's how the Sony and Nikon-mount 85mm lenses stack up (spoiler alert – the Viltrox wins on value):</p></div><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><span>Row 0 - Cell 0 </span></td><td><p>Sony E mount</p></td><td><p>Nikon Z mount</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro</p></td><td><p>$598 / £569 / AU$919</p></td><td><p>$598 / £569 / AU$919</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nikon Z 85mm F1.2 S</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>$2,999 / £2,799 / AU$4,749</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NIKKOR Z 85mm f/1.8 S</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>$849 / £789 / AU$1,399</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sigma 85mm F1.4 DG DN Art</p></td><td><p>$1,319 / £979 / AU$1,596</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sony FE 85mm F1.4 GM II</p></td><td><p>$2,049 / £1,799 / AU$2,499</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sony FE 85mm F1.8</p></td><td><p>$649 / £499 / AU$949</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h3><span>Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro: specs</span></h3><div><div><p>Swipe to scroll horizontally</p></div><div><table><caption>Viltrox AF 28mm f/4.5 specs</caption><tbody><tr><td><p>Type: </p></td><td><p>Mid-telephoto prime</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mount:</p></td><td><p>Sony E, Nikon Z</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sensor: </p></td><td><p>Full-frame</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Focal length: </p></td><td><p>85mm</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Max aperture: </p></td><td><p>f/1.4</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Minimum focus: </p></td><td><p>0.79m, 0.13x max magnification</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Filter size: </p></td><td><p>77mm</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dimensions: </p></td><td><p>84.5 x 108.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Weight: </p></td><td><p>28.2oz / 800g (lens only)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h3><span>Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro: design</span></h3><ul><li><strong>Durable, weather-sealed design, but prone to scratches</strong></li><li><strong>Around 25% heavier than alternatives</strong></li><li><strong>External controls suit photo and video work</strong></li></ul><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>4</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yhSjXApzAgXav97LZyvkVB.jpg" alt="Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro lens attached to a Nikon camera, mounted to a tripod outdoors and with bronze-colored ferns in the background" /></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Tim Coleman)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>The Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro's build quality and design are clearly excellent, and remind me of Sony's current standard-focal-length GM lenses – and even more so of Canon's new range of hybrid 'VCM' lenses, which includes a triple-the-price <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cameras/camera-lenses/canons-new-rf-85mm-f1-4-vcm-is-a-pin-sharp-and-dreamy-portrait-lens-for-a-much-lower-price-tag-than-the-85mm-f1-2">85mm F1.4L VCM</a>. As mentioned, Viltrox isn't permitted to make Canon RF lenses, but I've used both the Canon RF 85mm F1.4L VCM and Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro, and I'm having a hard time spotting any meaningful differences, besides the Canon lens being 25% lighter.</p><p>There's a ridged aperture ring that can be set to clicked or smooth adjustments between aperture values, and which could host a follow-focus mechanism for cinematic manual focusing, equipping the Viltrox 85mm lens well for photo and video work. Elsewhere, there's an AF/MF switch, a custom button, plus a large focus ring – every control is beautifully dampened / smooth in operation.</p><p>A rear rubber seal confirms the weather-sealing, and you'll find a USB-C port within the metal rear mount, through which future firmware upgrades can be installed.</p><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>2</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JgUSxtZPRk8oBn4njpjtPB.jpg" alt="Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro lens attached to a Nikon camera, mounted to a tripod outdoors and with bronze-colored ferns in the background" /></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Tim Coleman)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Viltrox supplies a chunky lens hood which easily screws on and off, while the lens accepts the common 77mm size of threaded filters.</p><p>There's a reassuring weight to the metal lens, although it's perhaps a little too weighty for its own good; at 800g it's around 25% heavier than the aforementioned Sony, Sigma and Canon equivalents. Measuring 108mm in length, it's similar in size to the Sony lens but bigger than Sigma's.</p><p>Despite its weight, I thought the balance between the Viltrox lens and mid-range Nikon camera, with which I was testing the lens, felt pretty good. I wouldn't want it any heavier or longer, but it just about sits within comfortable limits – and it would be an even better match with chunkier a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nikon-z8-review">Nikon Z8</a>.</p><p>Over the course of two months with the lens I've managed to look after it, and it still looks pristine. However, I've tested other Viltrox lenses in other scenarios with less care, including the AF 35mm F1.2 LAB which has a similar finish, and they've proved to be prone to scratches. I'm not going to test that theory for the sake of it, but that's my word of warning.</p><h3><span>Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro: Performance</span></h3><ul><li><strong>11-blade rounded aperture with f/1.4 to f/16 range, capable of smooth bokeh</strong></li><li><strong>Speedy and reliable VCM autofocus</strong></li><li><strong>Extremely sharp between f/2 and f/8</strong></li></ul><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>5</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnAkPJ5gMf9mZKbab5DfPB.jpg" alt="Close-up of the Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro lens attached to a Nikon camera, mounted to a tripod outdoors and with bronze-colored ferns in the background, emphasis on the lens aperture blades" /></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Tim Coleman)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>That big f/1.4 aperture is for sure a major selling point of the lens, especially when you consider that Viltrox already has two 85mm lenses for full-frame cameras in its range: the original 85mm f/1.8 and an 85mm f/2 EVO – the latter is the lightweight and affordable choice.</p><p>You can see how chunky the diameter of the lens is in the product gallery above, plus how big the lens aperture is through the range, with a generous 11-blades creating a circular aperture for attractive bokeh.</p><p>Like Canon's range of hybrid lenses, the Viltrox 85mm lens employs a Voice Coil Motor (VCM) which drives autofocus, and the result is snappy autofocus – it's quicker in my experience than Viltrox's pricier 135mm f/1.8 LAB.</p><p>Focusing is internal, meaning the lens size remains unchanged as it focuses, and that there are 'floating' lens elements inside. That means there's an unsettling rattling noise when moving the lens when it's not on the camera, or when the camera is not turned on. There's nothing to worry about here – that's totally normal, and it's the same with all such lenses. Those elements 'lock', and are ready to go for focusing when paired with a camera that's turned on.</p><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>9</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVdL5LJRBzCbYrRVSJ2jY9.jpg" alt="Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro lens sample gallery: man in a blue beanie, with blurry bronze-colored ferns in the background" /></div><figcaption><span>f/1.4</span><span>(Image credit: Tim Coleman)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Image quality impresses, truly. Detail is incredibly sharp, especially between f/2 and f/8, where lens distortion is also pretty much non-existent. Open the lens to f/1.4 and there's vignetting (darkening in the corners), but that's gone by somewhere between f/2 and f/2.8.</p><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>8</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rd3Zpnma2JqbC8kwmPkVgX.jpg" alt="Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro lens sample gallery: man holding the Fujifilm Instax Mini Evo Cinema camera" /></div><figcaption><span>An 85mm f/1.4 lens is a good option for product photography – I used it for my Instax Mini Evo Cinema shots</span><span>(Image credit: Tim Coleman)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Only in the most extreme scenarios, and with all lens corrections turned off, have I seen chromatic aberrations in my photos. One example was an image that included dew drops on a backlit cobweb.</p><p>Bokeh is super-smooth. Provided you're relatively close to your subject and shooting between f/1.4 and f/2.8, you'll typically get smooth and big bokeh that's rounded in shape – no ugly onion-ring effect in sight.</p><p>Increase focus distance and, as bokeh consequently gets smaller, it can go a little cats-eye in shape. Overall, however, bokeh looks lovely, and is a real reason to opt for this 85mm lens over Viltrox's other offerings.</p><div><div><p>Image </p><p>1</p><p> of </p><p>5</p></div><div><figure><div><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dm7wbVjg3KeNJu2nBfzK4b.jpg" alt="Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro lens sample gallery: moss and autumn leaves at the base of a tree" /></div><figcaption><span>At f/5, detail is staggeringly sharp across the entire frame</span><span>(Image credit: Tim Coleman)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>As is the case with other 85mm f/1.4 full-frame lenses, macro photography is not the Viltrox lens's forte. Minimum focus distance is 0.79m, making for a modest 0.13x maximum magnification. To be clear, the Sony and Sigma alternatives are no better.</p><p>Close focusing beyond the lens's capabilities is hardly the regular concern of a portrait photographer, but for me I like mixing up what I photograph, and would appreciate more versatile close focusing – it would make for a more complete lens.</p><h3><span>Should you buy the Viltrox AF 85mm F1.4 Pro?</span></h3><figure><div><p>

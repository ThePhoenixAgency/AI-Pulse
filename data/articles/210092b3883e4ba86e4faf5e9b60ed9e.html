    <pre><code>The official Presidents Day sales are now live through today and we have now added even more Apple deals to the collection. Alongside Apple Watch Series 11 models at $100 off starting from $299 (prices are starting to jump, get in there while you can), we are also tracking $150 off AirPods Max, deals on AirPods Pro 3, and a host of discounts on official Apple Watch bands. From there, we have $100 off the most affordable Mac mini with 24GB of RAM, iPhone 16 Pro/Max units at up to $630 off, loads of accessories, and more waiting below.&nbsp; All of the best Apple Presidents Day deals now live: AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, Macs, accessories, more from $18 LAST DAY – Amazon 2026 Presidents Day sale: Apple Watch, iPad, Galaxy gear, kitchen, more Most affordable 24GB Mac mini is $100 off for Presidents Day ($300 less than Amazon’s 24GB) While we already put together a sizable collection of Apple deals live for Presidents Day 2026, B&amp;H is landing again this morning with a compelling discount on the most affordable 24GB M4 Mac mini you can buy at $100 off – you can’t get this particular configuration at Amazon.
B&amp;H is now offering the M4 Mac mini with 256GB of storage and 24GB of RAM down at $699 shipped. This is a regularly $799 configuration if you bought it straight from Apple and not one you can even get at major retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.&nbsp;
You can land the most affordable model overall with the 16GB/256GB setup at $50 off via Amazon right now, but we have seen that model down at $499 many times at this point.&nbsp;
This B&amp;H configuration we have here today though, which by the way is a completely legit setup that just happens to be one Amazon doesn’t sell, is the most affordable you can buy that has 24GB of RAM. The 256GB of storage might not be all too exciting, but it is generally easy to supplement that with the external storage, portable SSDs, and so on you might already have – the RAM, not so much.
For more Apple President’s Day deals, you’ll find all of the early offers still live organized for you right here.&nbsp; iPhone 16 Pro/Max now up to $630 off orig. prices for Presidents Day (Amazon Renewed Premium) Joining a host of other Apple gear on sale today for Presidents Day 2026, we are also tracking a series of major discounts on iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max units at up to $630 off the original new prices. These deals come by way of the Amazon Renewed Premium program to deliver its highest-quality units and a 1-year warranty. Details below.
iPhone 16 Pro Presidents Day deals&nbsp; iPhone 16 256GB $649 (Orig. $899)
iPhone 16 Pro 512GB $819 (Orig. $1,299)
iPhone 16 Pro 1TB $869 (Orig. $1,499)
iPhone 16 Pro Max 512GB $929 (Orig. $1,399)
iPhone 16 Pro Max 1TB $989 (Orig. $1,599) You will find various colors for each of the configurations above now marked and shipping/sold straight from Amazon – this is key as it provides the best quality control and warranty policy for these units.&nbsp;
While there are deals on the 512GB models above, some of which are at the lowest prices we have tracked to date and sitting well below the original lists/the costs of the comparable unlocked iPhone 17 models, the prices aren’t all that much lower than the far more valuable 1TB models. They are less, but we just wanted to make sure we highlighted the fact that you drop an additional $50 or so for double the storage (an upgrade that would typically cost you $200).&nbsp; AirPods Presidents Day deals: AirPods Max $150 off, AirPods Pro 3, more The official 2026 Presidents Day sales are now upon on us for a final 24 hours, and the AirPods deals are still flowing. Amazon now has all five colors of the latest USB-C AirPods Max down at $150 off alongside the ongoing AirPods Pro 3 discount and some AirPods 4 offers as well.
Much of these deals went live last week as part of early sale events at Best Buy and Amazon, but Amazon has now refreshed its stock of the latest AirPods Max (USB-C) with all five colors now sitting down at the holiday pricing – that’s $449 shipped, or $150 off the $549 list price on all five models. AirPods Pro 3 $210 (Reg. $249)
AirPods 4 from $100 (Reg. $139 – $179)
AirPods Max (USB-C) $449 (Reg. $550) As for the rest of the current-generation lineup, the deal pricing from last week appears as though it will remain stable throughout the day (it is this morning anyway).&nbsp; Now live again: Official Anchor Blue Apple Sport Loop now down at $39, more from $29 Latest Neon Green Ocean Band adds a pop of color to Apple Watch Ultra at one of its best prices ever today (35% off) Apple Watch Presidents Day deals: Series 11 $100 off from $299, up to $150 off Ultra 3, more The clock is now ticking on the major Presidents Day events at Best Buy and Amazon, which might very well mean some of the best Apple Watch deals yet will be gone sooner than later. Not only are we still seeing the entire lineup of Series 11 models at$100 off and starting from $299, but there are also Ultra 2 models at $250 off and a solid chance to score a deep deal on the new Apple Watch Ultra 3 at up to $150 off. Details below.
Apple Watch Presidents Day deals
We have featured the ongoing Apple Watch Series 11 deals already, but considering we are talking about the most sought-after models sitting down at the lowest prices we have tracked since release, and the fact that these deals might be gone by day’s end, we wanted to make sure they were front and center: 42mm Apple Watch Series 11 $299 (Reg. $399)
46mm Apple Watch Series 11 $329 (Reg. $429)
42mm Apple Watch Series 11 Cell $399 (Reg. $499)
46mm Apple Watch Series 11 Cell $429 (Reg. $529) Those are perhaps the most popular of the Apple Watch deals live for Presidents Day 2026, but there are also some notable deals live on Apple Watch Ultra 2 and 3 right now:
Apple Watch Ultra 2 – $250 off in brand new condition: Black Apple Watch Ultra 2 – Ocean Band $549 (Reg. $799)

While Amazon is still offering up to $200 off the configurations it offers, some of the best deals can be found over at authorized dealer B&amp;H right now with as much as $300 slashed from the list prices. Early President’s Day M5 MacBook Pro deals 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro 16GB/512GB $1,449 (Reg. $1,599) 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro 16GB/1TB $1,599 (Reg. $1,799) 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro 24GB/512GB $1,549 (Reg. $1,799) 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro 32GB/512GB $1,699 (Reg. $1,999)
14-inch M5 MacBook Pro 32GB/1TB $1,899 (Reg. $2,199) As you can see in the list above, the first two offers in the list come by way of Amazon with $150 off the base 16GB/512GB model and $200 off the 16GB/1TB. These deals are on par with the lowest we have tracked since the big Black Friday and holiday all-time lows that had both models at $250 off.&nbsp;
The bottom three deals in the list above are from B&amp;H. If you’re looking towards an upgraded configuration, these are the best deals we can find online from a reputable authorized Apple dealer, delivering as much as $250 off the most affordable 24GB configuration you can buy and $300 off a couple of options with 32GB of RAM. The 24GB config here with the 512GB SSD is the most affordable setup you can buy with 24GB of RAM and one you cannot purchase at Amazon – its 24GB model has 1TB of storage and is now on sale at $1,825 from its regular $1,999 list price.

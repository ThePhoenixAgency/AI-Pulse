<p>Apple plans a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-reportedly-working-on-a-budget-macbook-powered-by-iphone-chip/">cheaper MacBook</a> aimed at students and first-time buyers, and the most noticeable change is not the chip or the price but the palette, because the company wants this model to stand out visually while still keeping the familiar Mac identity.</p>



<p>The laptop will sit below the MacBook Air and use an iPhone-class processor, which signals a shift in strategy where Apple focuses on accessibility and volume sales rather than peak performance, and that also explains why design and color choices matter more than raw specifications for this product category.</p>



<p>According to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-15/tesla-carplay-delays-related-to-ios-26-and-fsd-apple-s-new-siri-delays-ios-27">new report</a> from <em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Mark Gurman, the company will unveil the device at a March event and test several playful finishes, noting the machine will arrive in “a slew of fun colors” meant to attract younger buyers and schools.</p>



<h2>Low-cost MacBook colors</h2>



<p>Apple reportedly tested these shades:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Light yellow</strong></li>



<li><strong>Light green</strong></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pink</strong></li>



<li><strong>Classic silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dark gray</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Not all options will ship, but the direction is clear. Apple wants the entry MacBook to feel closer to the iPad lineup than the professional laptop range, which traditionally sticks to muted tones.</p>



<h2>Hardware direction</h2>



<p>Instead of a Mac-optimized M-series chip, the laptop uses an A18 Pro processor derived from the iPhone 16 family. Performance lands below a MacBook Air but remains competitive with early Apple silicon Macs, which keeps everyday tasks smooth while lowering production costs.</p>



<p>The display measures just under 13 inches, previously rumored to be around 12.9 inches, and the company refused to switch to plastic even at a lower price tier. Instead, engineers created a faster aluminum shell manufacturing process that keeps the premium feel while reducing production time.</p>



<p>The report describes the strategy clearly, saying Apple wants to keep “build quality” intact while trimming costs in other areas rather than changing materials.</p>



<h2>Position in Apple lineup</h2>



<p>The laptop targets education and enterprise deployments where price matters more than power, and the colorful exterior works as a visual signal that this is a different class of Mac.</p>



<p>If Apple launches it near the expected sub-$1000 range, the low-cost MacBook colors become a key selling point because they separate the model from the conservative MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lines while helping the company expand market share in entry computing under Apple Inc.</p>

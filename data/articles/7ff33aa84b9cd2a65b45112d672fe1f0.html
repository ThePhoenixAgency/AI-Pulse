    <div><div>   <p>​Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADSK">ADSK</a>) is one of the <strong><a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/10-profitable-saas-companies-for-2026-1694242/" target="_blank">Profitable SaaS Companies for 2026</a></strong>. On February 9, Reuters reported that Autodesk has sued Google over alleged “Flow” trademark infringement to market competing AI tools used for making film, TV, and gaming production.</p>   <p>​Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) highlighted in the complaint it filed with the San Francisco federal court that the company started using Flow in 2022 for visual effects and was surprised to see Google launching Flow software in 2025 for the same customers. The complaint also notes that despite assurances, Google filed a secretive trademark application in Tonga to support US claims and later marketed the software at events, including the Sundance Film Festival. The complaint said,</p>   <blockquote><p>​”Google’s false representation that it would always use a combination of its house mark and Flow was intended to buy time to allow it to swamp Autodesk’s place in the market.”</p> </blockquote>   <figure><div> <p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eoJFT1x0GaZE7bwH9TdZww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUzOA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insidermonkey.com/1cf4137236bb3577f03b158e2081f2f7" alt=""></p></div>  </figure>   <p>​That said, Wall Street is bullish on Autodesk. Recently, on February 2, Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy without disclosing any price targets. On the same day, J.P. Morgan also upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy and maintained the $319 price target.</p>   <p>​Autodesk develops 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software for industries like architecture, construction, manufacturing, and media. Some of its key products include AutoCAD, Revit, Inventor, Maya, and 3ds Max.</p>        <p>While we acknowledge the potential of ADSK as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

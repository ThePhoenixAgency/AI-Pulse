<p><strong>The US cybersecurity agency CISA on Thursday warned that recently disclosed SolarWinds, Notepad++, and Apple vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild.</strong>



</p><p>Tracked as CVE-2025-40536 (CVSS score of 8.1) and <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/solarwinds-patches-critical-web-help-desk-vulnerabilities/">disclosed</a> at the end of January, the SolarWinds flaw is described as a security control bypass in Web Help Desk (WHD) that could allow unauthenticated attackers to access restricted functionality.



</p><p>The security defect was found and reported by Horizon3.ai, which warned that it could be exploited to create a valid AjaxProxy instance, allowing attackers to exploit additional bugs to achieve remote code execution (RCE).



</p><p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2026/02/12/cisa-adds-four-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">CISA added</a> CVE-2025-40536 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list, urging federal agencies to patch it within three days.



</p><p>The agency has not shared details on the observed exploitation, but its warning comes a week after Microsoft said that CVE-2025-40536 might have been <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/recent-solarwinds-flaws-potentially-exploited-as-zero-days/">exploited as a zero-day</a> in an attack observed in December 2025.



</p><p>The tech giant said that CVE-2025-40551, another fresh WHD issue that was <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/fresh-solarwinds-vulnerability-exploited-in-attacks/">added to CISA’s KEV list</a> last week, might have been targeted as a zero-day as well, in the same attack.</p>



<p>Another zero-day added to CISA’s KEV list on Thursday is CVE-2026-20700, a buffer overflow vulnerability that Apple has just patched, warning <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/apple-patches-ios-zero-day-exploited-in-extremely-sophisticated-attack/">it has been exploited</a> in an extremely sophisticated attack.



</p><p>Another newly disclosed vulnerability that has made it to CISA’s KEV list is CVE-2025-15556, an update integrity verification flaw in Notepad++ patched in early February.



</p><p>Rooted in the lack of cryptographic verification of downloaded update metadata and installers, the issue affects Notepad++ deployments using the WinGUp updater and could allow attackers to intercept update traffic and supply modified installers, achieving arbitrary code execution.



</p><p>China-linked hackers were seen <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/notepad-supply-chain-hack-conducted-by-china-via-hosting-provider/">exploiting the flaw for initial access</a> in attacks that likely started in June 2025. Rapid7 has attributed the campaign to the cyberespionage group tracked as Lotus Blossom.



</p><p>The fourth CVE added to CISA’s KEV list on Thursday is CVE-2024-43468, a critical-severity RCE flaw in Microsoft Configuration Manager that was <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/patch-tuesday-microsoft-confirms-exploited-zero-day-in-windows-management-console/">resolved in October 2024</a>. 



</p><p>It is described as an SQL injection bug that can be exploited without authentication or user interaction via specially crafted requests. 



</p><p>Proof-of-concept (PoC) code targeting CVE-2024-43468 has been publicly available for over a year, but there appear to have been no reports of it being exploited in attacks prior to CISA’s warning.



</p><p>CISA has given federal agencies three weeks to apply patches for the Apple, Microsoft, and Notepad++ vulnerabilities.

And Adam, there’s always something, some sort of outage around our conversations, some sort of big event… There’s something in open source, there’s a debacle, there’s an outage in the case of AWS recently… And I actually was at my son’s ninja training last night, and overheard a parent discuss the AWS outage. So it permeated, normal folks would just say; everyone was hit by this.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. It’s got big.</p> </div> <div> <p>What’s the juice? What are your thoughts on this? Is it just one machine in Ashburn, Virginia that’s running this thing? What’s the state of our cloud?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, that’s a good question. This was an interesting one to watch as an old guy.</p> </div> <div> <p>Okay…</p> </div> <div> <p>You know, I feel an old guy, in that I helped build the early internet, and then… You know, I went through these waves… And we spent a long time in the sort of early part of the DevOps movement trying to figure out how people should react when these outages happen, and sort of the HugOps movement, and trying to be “Hey, you should have some empathy”, And there was just none that I saw in this outage. It went to brutality. It was a –</p> </div> <div> <p>“Someone must die…”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. It was we were playing Mortal Kombat, man…</p> </div> <div> <p>“Finish him!”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, totally. Corey Quinn wrote this article that was “Basically, this happened because all the smart people left.” That was my TL;DR of his article.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, yeah…</p> </div> <div> <p>And I was like, a) I couldn’t imagine writing that article. All love to Corey as a person or whatever, but I was just like, if I worked at AWS and it was “All the smart people left, and so now the outages are coming…”</p> </div> <div> <p>That one hurts.</p> </div> <div> <p>You’re “Oh. Uh. Oh. Brutal.” Also, who do you think built those old systems that are failing? It was the smart people that you’re lamenting having left, It’s not the new guy… The new guy didn’t put that together, It was the old timers who put that together, and that’s what failed you now.</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s right. They’re duct-taping.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, they’re just trying to keep it going, you know?</p> </div> <div> <p>The other take was they’re cutting over to their AI SREs, or whatever.</p> </div> <div> <p>Sure… [laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>“It’s AI’s fault” was the other take.</p> </div> <div> <p>“It was all AI slop”, or whatever. And I don’t know, all of that feels crazy to me. Obviously, we have no idea. Not really. I mean, they’ve said some things, I think –</p> </div> <div> <p>I’m sure it was DNS, you know…</p> </div> <div> <p>I’m sure it was DNS. We’re all pretty sure it was DNS. That feels an easy bet, you know?</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs]</p> </div> <div>
<p>So I was just struck by – I was struck by a couple of things. One was the brutality, which - I think we could bring a little more of the empathy and humility back into the equation, of just like… You know, if today you weren’t affected by the outage… We saw a lot of people who were like “Well, we were smart, so we weren’t in USS East one, because that’s where all the outages happen. And we use GCP.” And I’m like “Well, what about all the tiny outages for the global backplane in Google that keep happening to you all the time?” And they’re were like “You know…” But they don’t talk about those, because “It’s our moment to bag on the dummies”, who are, whatever, “people who didn’t make the choices I made.” And I don’t know, my experience in all of these things is that even when you’d really try hard to design for resilience – you can build systems that are very resilient to failure. And it is hard to do. And that’s awesome. And even when you do that, they will fail, in ways that you did not expect, and they will by definition be difficult to deal with… Because otherwise you would have expected them.</p>
<p>I had a conversation with someone who sort of got mad at me because I said that. I was like “You should have some empathy, because your day is coming. If today wasn’t your outage day, congratulations. Tomorrow will be your outage day, so get ready for that one.”</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s right.</p> </div> <div> <p>And they were like “We’re good engineers.” And I’m like “Man, you cannot good-engineer your way out of this.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Is that your best Kermit the frog impression?</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] Is that what that was, Kermit? I don’t think so.</p> </div> <div> <p>I can do Kermit the – I can do a reasonably good Kermit frog. Yeah. “Your outage day will come. You will not enjoy what happens when your site goes down. What you will need is rainbows and hugs.”</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] We do best/worst at dinner, and that’s been my best today. Adam Jacob impersonated Kermit the frog. That was the best.</p> </div> <div> <p>That was pretty good.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, I once did an entire – a scene from Romeo and Juliet as Kermit the frog.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, wow. [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:07:27.07">00:07:27.07</a>] on video.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, the next time you have a company-wide announcement, pull it out then.</p> </div> <div> <p>Do that as Kermit the frog? Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>There you go. Psychoanalyzing, if you will, the public response to this. I was trying to figure out why it was so gnarly this time around, and I feel like maybe it’s because at this point AWS is kind of the man. They’re like the Darth Vader of cloud services. I mean, maybe not that evil, but that important and scary, and… You know, if Darth Vader loses, you’re like “Awesome.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. It’s easy. Like, when somebody shows up and goes “You should have empathy for AMOS, for AWS.” It’s easy to be like [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:08:08.15">00:08:08.15</a>]</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, exactly.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:08:12.01">00:08:12.01</a>] It’s not like AWS has empathy for me, AWS is a shark. They’re out there eating to live, man… I don’t know. I appreciate that about AWS, actually. I appreciate the part where they’re very transparent about the fact that what they’re in it for is the dollar bills. I know where I stand… [laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>You know what they’re all about. Sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. No one’s pretending that we’re doing something we’re not.</p> </div> <div> <p>And they’re so good at it. I mean, there’s a reason why they’re the big dog, it’s because they are very good at it.</p> </div> <div>
<p>And it’s not because they’re bad at it. So yeah, I think some of it is just that AWS for sure is there. I think some of it is that everything does actually move in cycles, and the cycle that brought us HugOps, and the cycle that brought us a lot of the first generation of root cause analysis, and more empathy for outages, and all those sorts of things… That generation came out of an era where it was really hard to build these sorts of systems and stay resilient on the internet. When we were telling you those stories, it was like “How do you build a data center that doesn’t go down? How do you think about scale?” Those were all new concepts. Now they’re not. And people have been trying to implement them, and trying to do those things, and trying to put those good practices into place, and it’s become a very corporate sort of piece of the story… And so now you’ve got people who are second, third, fourth generation maybe even, of trying to build these scalable, resilient systems… And so they don’t remember what it was before those things happened. Like, they don’t actually have empathy for the guy who built the system kind of wrong… Because either they’re new, and they’ve just never experienced it, or because they came up in a different way and they were just told “This is how you do it.” So if you started your career being like “Well, you can always deploy to multiple availability zones, and across clouds, and you can stream the blah, blah, blahs.” I put all my stuff in a CDN. I remember when there weren’t CDNs, so you just had to be like “Do you have enough web servers?” And now you have those things. So I think there’s a shifting of the technology landscape that also shifts people’s perspective on what those outages are, and what those problems are like, and what the expectations are…</p>
<p>And then, you know, Amazon’s laying people off, they’re also growing, AI fear, slop… All those things are in the air, too. Sometimes the AI marketing feels… Tawdry, is the word I’ll use for it. And it’s tough.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>I think all of that comes together to be like “Okay, AWS has an outage, and now it’s Mortal Kombat time.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Right. Finish him.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, it’s also just fun. It’s fun to finish people. [laughs] Rip the heart out, and [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:10:53.13">00:10:53.13</a>]</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. The finish him’s kind of been a slow burn too, in terms of the cloud exodus. You’ve got those who have to be on-prem, those who want to be on-prem, those who desire to only have their two racks, paid for by themselves, and manage the two machines – and maybe it is two racks, I don’t know. I mean, that’s not that hard to manage with a decent team, versus paying the cloud millions over years… Using the DHH argument, so to speak.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>So it hasn’t been this – I think maybe now is the finishing moment for some folks, but is the finishing moment coming from non-technical folks, or technical folks and non-technical folks?</p> </div> <div> <p>I think both, maybe.</p> </div> <div> <p>Just everybody…</p> </div> <div>
<p>Yeah, I think it’s everybody. I think everybody’s ready for it to change. On a technical front, there’s a bunch of really interesting things happening. If you’re building new AI data centers, you need all these GPUs. That’s where our focus is. But you also need high-performance compute, because the agents that are running in those situations, they’re running on normal CPUs. They’re not running on the GPUs. But the data center design there pushes you toward on-prem, low-latency networks, it pushes you towards simpler compute…</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:12:11.24">00:12:11.24</a>] I was having a conversation with some people who build those data centers, and they were like “Yeah, all our customers want is tons of GPUs, super-fast networking, and bare metal compute. They don’t want any layers in between.” They’re just gonna bootstrap that, giant high-performance compute clusters, and they’re just going to knock out all the stuff in the middle. And it’s interesting when you think about those workloads causing their own kind of gravity, where as soon as you start to have a data center, you start to have bare metal compute, you start to have fast networks, then suddenly you start to ask questions, like “Well, hey, what else could we run on that compute?”</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s right.</p> </div> <div> <p>“We do have this fast network right here. What else could we do?” And it starts to push you in this very strange direction where it’s like “Oh, actually, for the workloads we were running, it kind of did make a lot of sense to be like “Well, let’s just go to AWS, and I can get burst capacity, and I can do all this stuff…” And now you’re like “Well, actually… Hold on a second. If I have to pack this data center filled with compute anyway, and it needs its own little nuclear power reactor sitting next to it…” You know, suddenly it’s not so crazy person talk to imagine running all your gear in a different way; or even building your applications in a different way. And the AI thing feels like it’s – it already feels like it’s in late innings, because it’s been moving so fast… But it’s not. It’s absolutely in the earliest of innings, where we’re just trying to figure out what even is this technology, how even will we think about it, what even are the implications? And yeah, the cloud repatriation thing I think is actually a bigger deal than people are giving it credit for, because the dynamics are pushing you toward being on prem, fast networks, slumber compute.</p> </div> <div> <p>My exposure to this world is really through the lens of home lab, which is why I sort of get on this soapbox and preach it a bit… But I recently went to the Linux Fest here in Austin, Texas. It was awesome. Really cool, just homegrown bunch, real just kind of regional feeling; didn’t feel overwhelming at all. And I forget the fellow’s name, but he gave a class, essentially, a workshop on Bootc. And I was just thinking how easy it is now to instantiate images that was once really hard to kind of make your own distro…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah…!</p> </div> <div> <p>You know, Bootc has opened up so much windows for me. I’m just thinking about it in like Proxmox in my home lab scenario, but…</p> </div> <div> <p>Totally.</p> </div> <div> <p>…you’ve got so much more power in the hands of folks at that level to really run your own bare metal now.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yes. And that’s going to come back around again. That’s happening because people are doing it. Once you start doing it, and the macro trend starts pushing you in that direction, people are going to start being like “You know what sucks? Trying to find the SSM parameter for what the right revision of Amazon Linux is.” The only way I do that anymore is with the little AI agent for System Initiative, by saying “Figure it out.”</p> </div> <div> <p>“Tell me.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Because - I don’t know, I’ve done it a hundred times; I still don’t remember. But when you think about that loop of “Oh, so much of the technology layers - they have been moving forward.” They weren’t stagnant. And yeah, I think there’s more afoot here. There’s a lot afoot here.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, people want control back, too. The original idea was – maybe for some it was like “Hey, there’s a cloud here I can launch today. I don’t have to build the infrastructure, pay for the infrastructure, even understand how to run the infrastructure necessarily…”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:15:45.28">00:15:45.28</a>] You can sort of level up. And then you have this new world where you’re like - well, fine, we’ve sort of either… The choice initially was let’s move fast, so let’s use somebody else’s investment. Cloud. Now it’s like, now we have proven our model, our product, or whatever, and we’re matured. Now we’re just burning cash, because we have no idea what our bill is even. There’s so many servers out there, maybe three or four different accounts floating around… We’ve got bills going out the wazoo to AWS… And there becomes a lack of clarity. And there’s even a cottage industry of - I don’t know what they’re called. Like bill analyzers, essentially, for AWS…</p> </div> <div> <p>Totally. Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>You know what I mean? So, I mean, that shows there’s a problem.</p> </div> <div> <p>Cost optimization. Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. Cost optimization. And then now you’ve got this pushback to say “Let’s actually reexamine, first principles of this problem set. Do we really need to be in their cloud? We need a cloud… Why not our cloud?”</p> </div> <div>
<p>Yeah. And what’s going to happen - all of those trends are happening all at the same time. So we’re going to figure out, okay, AI brings a new interaction model to the table. It brings capabilities that didn’t exist before to every layer of this stack. A good example was we’re building a continuous delivery example of just taking a complex application, deploying that thing up to AWS, and then showing how all the pieces fit together with System Initiative. And it’s been really interesting to work with this AI agent where you’re working with the source code and the infrastructure at the exact same time, in the same context window… And the things that it figures out how to do - like, I needed to add ElastiCache in order to figure out how to do session storage, basically. Because we’re just reinventing legacy problems… And to show how you would solve it. And it solved that problem for me by analyzing the source code, looking at how we implemented it, I said I was going to use ElastiCache, I wanted to use IAM for auth… It wrote the weird signing code to figure out how to do the right thing… It cycles the key every 10 minutes automatically, so that it will always have a fresh connection… And then it deployed the infrastructure and wrote the application code, and then we pushed it up and it worked.</p>
<p>And that loop is the loop that the people who are going to be building those internal infrastructures have now. So when you think about it as “Oh, they’re going to go back–” There’s a version of the story where they’re going backwards, where what’s happening is “We’re putting my backpack on, and I’m going back to data centers, and I’m going to rack the servers, and I’m going to put the operating systems on them, and I’m going to configure them by hand.” And like, no. No. That’s not actually what’s going to happen at all. What’s going to happen is these new capabilities are going to show up, along with the ability to run high-performance compute. People are going to start to realize how much power comes out of that high-performance compute, and that new style of deployment and of software development is going to get applied to that problem. It’s not going to look like it looked in 1996. It’s not going to be like “Well, I set up my BOOTP server.” No. Somebody’s going to figure out how to put the new loop into that system, at which point it’s going to make the cloud look slow. You’re going to be like “Why am I dealing with all this legacy cloud? [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:19:03.15">00:19:03.15</a>] stuff’s garbage. Ugh. Look how much harder it is.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, the black boxes are actually the bug, not the feature. You wanted the magic for a bit there, right?</p> </div> <div> <p>You needed it.</p> </div> <div> <p>You’re like “Great. We need magic. We need it right now, because we don’t have the money or the talent to do the magic. We need the magic.”</p> </div> <div>
<p>I have friends who started this company called iLike. You won’t remember iLike, but iLike was one of the first music services on Facebook. It was one of the first Facebook apps, and it was a music sharing Facebook app. And they were the first viral Facebook app. And they literally had to beg our friends - the guys who ran it, I’d worked with for a decade. And they literally were begging us for gear. They were just like “Can you give us servers…?!” They couldn’t rack them enough to keep the site up. And then within a month, AWS launched EC2, and we helped them just automate running that burst load into EC2, and it was good. They didn’t have that problem anymore. That problem disappeared for the entire internet. Amazing. And also, boy, computers are a lot faster now. Boy, caching’s a lot better. Boy, the architecture has fundamentally shifted.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:20:08.22">00:20:08.22</a>] We used to have to deliver the web tier to you. I don’t have to deliver web tiers very much anymore. I just throw it to a CDN and I move on with my life. So if it’s talking to my data center in the backend, a lot of that bursty load doesn’t actually happen the same way it used to. Right? And we just haven’t quite caught up yet as an industry - of course, because it’s happening in real time - to the fact that all of these new capabilities, they’re going to create a new wave of innovation, that will actually change the way we work.</p>
<p>So yeah, I don’t think the cloud repatriation thing is going to happen by going back to the way we’ve been doing it. It’s going to happen because we’re literally going to invent a new way of working, and we’re going to be like “This thing’s sick, and it works with gear, and it has a totally different, new loop.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Who’s going to build it? Is it the people who are going back to the old way, but don’t want the old way anymore, and so they’re doing it for themselves, and now they’re going to abstract tooling, because they want the new way of life on their own stack? I’m thinking of Rail, and –</p> </div> <div> <p>DHH?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, that’s what I’m thinking of in particular, but I don’t know if he’s necessarily going to build it, but… Is it going to be someone like that, or is it going to be somebody who is trying to just solve that one problem?</p> </div> <div>
<p>I don’t know, it’s hard to say. If it happens like the old school happened, it’ll happen because the practitioners will do it. And they’ll do it inside their houses kind of quietly, and then eventually they’ll all meet up in some kind of weird Cambrian explosion of realizing that they all do it this same, interesting, new, different way, and then they’ll productize that. I don’t know that that’s the same arc, because the industry has grown so much, venture capital has grown so much, access – you know, so much of that is different. But I would argue that the size of the opportunity is big enough, because the amount of open field running that it creates, in terms of - you know, the first wave of it is always just like “Well, there’s this new technology. How do we apply that new technology to what already exists?” It turns out it’s fine when you do that. The results are fine. They’re fine. They’re fine. They’re probably not great, but they’re fine. But if you design systems to do it, if you’re like “A-ha! Now I know that I have this capability. I’m going to design the whole stack around the fact that this capability exists. How would that change what I engineer, and how would it change the end user experience?” That’s dramatic. So I think the people that are going to build that for you, they’re going to be the people who figure that part out. They’re going to be like “Okay, I’m open to what the changes are in the technology. I’m open to the possibilities that there’s a different way of doing it.” That’s either going to be because they’re young and they don’t know any better, and they’re going to build it, and then our reaction is going to be like “Well, that was dumb.”</p>
<p>I was talking to somebody who built Docker, and they used to go into Solaris shops, and the Solaris heads would be like “I’m never using Docker. I have zones. Miss me with your subpar technology.”</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>And you know, we’ll do that to them. We’ll be like “I don’t need Docker. I’ve got zones.” And eventually, your zones are just running Docker instances.</p> </div> <div> <p>You still have Docker file syntax, you still have container file syntax… Docker’s not going to go – it’s embedded forever into the fabric of ops.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, but we all had that – I had that argument, too. I was like “Why would you do that? You need configuration management.” And they’re like “Nah… Sure, grandpa…”</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] “We don’t need configs…”</p> </div> <div> <p>If it’s going to be like that, you know… And so maybe it’ll be some of us, some of the people who have come before, who still have the spark in us, and we go figure out how to innovate in this way… Or it’s going to be people who don’t, and they’ll do it… I don’t know which one it’ll be, but… You can make good bets that it’ll be fueled by venture capital dollars.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. I was thinking, like, what if there was a brand new Digital Ocean that was starting in 2026, and –</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>…that might be the kind of entity that produces something like this.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:24:00.06">00:24:00.06</a>] Totally. It would. But think about Oxide, who’s close to this already, in that they took the cloud paradigm and they stuck it in the data center.</p> </div> <div> <p>Right.</p> </div> <div> <p>I wouldn’t put it past them to ratchet it one notch further, and go “Wait, why are we stuck trying to give you the clouds paradigm if we could deliver you a better one? What if we delivered you a better user experience than the cloud?”</p> </div> <div> <p>They’re already first-principaling everything, so why not?</p> </div> <div> <p>Right. So why not just keep going? And I don’t know the answer to that, I don’t have any secret inside Oxide knowledge or whatever, but…</p> </div> <div> <p>We don’t either.</p> </div> <div>
<p>…but it’s a good example of how – I would argue those guys are the old school. Nobody would look at Bryan and be like “Bryan’s not old school engineering at this point.” But I wouldn’t put it past them. They’ve shown a remarkable capacity to change… So I don’t know where it’s going to come from.</p>
<p>What I’ve become is more convinced that it’s more real than people are giving it credit for, and it’s also worse than most people think in terms of its capabilities. Most of us are just not getting good results out of the AI work that we’re doing, because we fundamentally misunderstand how it works kind of as a technology. And so then when we talk about how to apply it to our problems, we’re doing that badly, too. And so we’re still in the phase where it’s like 10% at best of everything that’s using AI is actually good, or is pointing the way at a pattern that’s going to be good. And then 90% of it is noise. And it’s incredibly difficult to tell the difference if you haven’t just decided to immerse yourself in it, because it’s moving so quickly that you’re like “I don’t know.” At some point it just overwhelms you.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, or even build something new, and then Anthropic or OpenAI releases a new thing on top of the kind of base frontier models most people are using, and it changes the game anyways. It’s constantly in motion in some sort of – we were just talking this morning about skills. And I’m like “Gosh, I just caught up with MCP servers, and then now they’ve launched skills.” And sure, skills are just Markdown files, basically .md versus .sh, but in plain English… So it’s sort of interesting to see how they’ve gone from a TypeScript-based SDK MCP server that you install via the command line, to something different that’s just simply adding a Markdown file.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, it has slightly different use cases, has slightly different capabilities… This is back to it being early innings. It feels late. There’s so much noise, there’s so much money, everybody’s like “There’s a bubble…” I saw a very convincing presentation from a bunch of investment bankers that there is not an AI bubble. It was very convincing.</p> </div> <div> <p>What’s their central premise?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. I was going to say, give us the TL;DR.</p> </div> <div> <p>Give us the central premise.</p> </div> <div> <p>What’s the juice? Give us the juice…!</p> </div> <div> <p>The central juice was that if you look at the forward multiple the market is paying for the growth numbers that are being put up, the actual revenue growth numbers, that they’re actually relatively modest in historic terms. Like, they’re actually not giving them growth multiples that are beyond mortal man. And so when you actually look at the fundamentals of the companies that we’re discussing, their fundamentals are actually pretty good, and getting better. And typically, when things are bubbles, that’s not what you see. What you see is dramatically higher growth multiples that don’t make any sense. And we’ve seen that in private investments –</p> </div> <div> <p>Like in ’22. 2022, things were crazy.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. 2009, 2001… 1999… It’s not pets.com.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>Sure.</p> </div> <div>
<p>It’s not InfoSpace, where the emperor literally had no clothes except hype, but we hyped ourselves to a market cap bigger than Microsoft. That was a bubble; that was going to explode. In this case there’s a lot of money moving into it, a lot of venture capital cash moving into it. That’s all true. Private valuations - it’s easy to talk about them as if they were public market valuations. They’re not. So the resiliency of private markets to paying those multiples is way different than regular people…</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:28:08.23">00:28:08.23</a>] So their analysis was basically “Look, in the main, the way the market’s reacting is in line with the actual growth curve that’s happening, and it’s being relatively modest around the values that they’re paying in multiples.” And then everywhere else is depressed.</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s true…</p> </div> <div> <p>So if you’re not in those sectors, then your value multiples are down. And so it doesn’t feel great, and so you look at it emotionally and you’re like “It’s a bubble.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, and that sends more money into that particular space as well, right? Because there’s less –</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, their argument then was also what it does is drive investors to find alpha.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, exactly.</p> </div> <div> <p>So now what they’re going to do - they have to find growth somewhere, and so that’s what’s driving IPOs, that’s what’s driving M&amp;A. All of those things are happening because yes, those AI stocks are outperforming. Also, you can’t beat them… So there is no better alpha than those. So if you want to do better than just betting all your money on the magnificent seven, the only way to do that is to find other unseen growth stocks and put your money there.</p> </div> <div> <p>And those are all embedded with the magnificent seven. Yeah, so the weird part to me is the circular deals. I mean, that’s the part that is just crazy.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, that’s crazy. I agree.</p> </div> <div> <p>I just don’t get it. I don’t understand how it all makes sense, but apparently it might.</p> </div> <div> <p>I mean, I understand how the deals get done, for sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yes, how they get done. But do they make any sense? I don’t know about that.</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] I don’t know. I don’t know if they make sense either.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>I don’t know that they do. But by their argument, which was very convincing, was that that’s not a structural threat to the economy.</p> </div> <div> <p>Sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>Like, yup, that could be bad. And… Meh. And whatever, I’m not sophisticated enough to make an argument one way or the other.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, I’m not either. I just think, when one of those organizations is Nvidia, which happens to be the darling of our economy right now… If they have a big correction, I think everything does… But maybe not.</p> </div> <div> <p>If the magnificent seven corrects, the economy corrects, for sure. I don’t know that that would mean that it’s a bubble. I think it would – do you know what I’m saying?</p> </div> <div> <p>Sure.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s different. We’re perhaps parsing –</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, we are. The demand is there, that’s the overall premise is there.</p> </div> <div> <p>The demand is there. We’re not building ahead of demand.</p> </div> <div> <p>We are not going to be over-provisioned in 2028 and have way too many data centers.</p> </div> <div> <p>In AI data centers. We are not. We’re not. And there’s a lot of people who are hoping that’s true, who are probably listening to this podcast, who are like “I f****n hate AI”, and I cross my arms, and I’m like “The whole thing’s stupid” and “You shouldn’t use it”, and whatever. They show up every time I talk about AI on LinkedIn being like “It’s all lies.” And they’re just wrong.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. They’re way wrong.</p> </div> <div>
<p>They’re just wrong. And whether they know they’re wrong now, or they know they’re wrong in six months, they will learn that they are wrong. Because it is actually transformative technology, it actually can make a difference right now… And yes, 99% of what’s being built is not a good use of that technology. Just like 99% of the early uses of search engines weren’t better.</p>
<p>We’ve got to figure out how it works, we’ve got to figure out how to build technology around it… We’re in the beginnings of doing all of that work… And what we got caught up in was this hype cycle that was like “Oh, it’s going to be AGI. The magic robots are going to take over. They’re going to just run everybody’s jobs. It’s going to become super-intelligent. It’s Terminator.” And none of that’s what’s happening. If you’ve actually used these systems, the idea that they’re going to turn to the Terminator is laughable. Laughable.</p>
<p><strong>Break</strong>: [<a href="#t=00:31:49.15">00:31:49.15</a>]</p> </div> <div> <p>There was a recent Anthropic research document that was a little scary, that I can put in the show notes and that I can paraphrase… It tried to protect itself when being threatened with being replaced, or something else, essentially. It was like self-preservation… But then they said in production, they didn’t see that happening… It was pretty wild.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s wild, but like –</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s recent. That’s on their homepage recent, too.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, the Anthropic CEO is one of the most bullish bulls in the –</p> </div> <div> <p>And it’s in their best interest. I was giving a talk to an unnamed organization in the federal government, and –</p> </div> <div> <p>Agentic misalignment, sorry. This is what they call it, agentic misalignment.</p> </div> <div> <p>That sounds scary.</p> </div> <div> <p>So just so we’re clear, it wasn’t the LLM that got misaligned. It was the agent in the control loop… And if you just think about how LLMs work, you’re like “Sure, what’s the probability that what I should respond to –” How many human beings have written “I don’t want to die”? A lot of people put that into the world. They’re like “I’m scared of that. Dying is bad. Don’t die.” So then you’re like “Okay, what are the odds that the right next word for the LLM to say is “Don’t die”? And then that emerges as making tool calls to preserve itself. That’s not crazy person talk. It’s not even magic. You’re like “Sure.” It’s kind of predictable. But it doesn’t make for a super-great blog post… Right? The great blog post is like “The agent tried to keep itself alive…! It found an instinct to self-preservation.” And you’re like “It didn’t find an instinct to self-preservation…”</p> </div> <div> <p>Listen, it said blackmail. The word blackmail is in this research document.</p> </div> <div> <p>Because they gave it access to tools like email, and they were like “Oh, you know what I should do?” and it went off the rails.</p> </div> <div> <p>“Get that CEO…! Finish him!”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, exactly. I get how it happens. My point isn’t that it didn’t happen. Of course it happened. Of course it happened. It’s just, if you know how the technology works, you’re like “Yup. Okay. That’s funny. But I can see how it gets into that loop. And I don’t think it’s magic. I don’t think it’s threatening. I don’t think we’re all going to die.” It’s a good case for why you shouldn’t give it a nuclear bomb.</p> </div> <div> <p>Let’s bring it back down to bare metal, or practicality… My usage of generating a lot of software, lately, mostly around CLIs and useful tools for me in my own lab, or as Jerod says – what did you say, Jerod? Home cooked meals?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>Home cooked software.</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s right.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:35:56.18">00:35:56.18</a>] I have full faith that this is only going to give more jobs to developers, and not replace… Because it is smart, but it doesn’t have taste. It doesn’t have direction. It doesn’t have the problem set. It just wants to be useful, and solve problems, even if it’s totally the wrong way.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yes, absolutely.</p> </div> <div> <p>I was trying to make an MCP server the other day for this thing I’m working on… And I’m like “The docs. Have you read the docs yet? I don’t want to go read the docs, that’s why I’m talking to you. You’re the agent. You go read the docs and tell me how it should work.” It was like “That’s a great idea.” No joke.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. Oh, good call. Yeah. Exactly. And back to just basic economics - what is the demand for software systems? And will those software systems demand become met? …at which point now there’s fewer of us. As far as I can tell, the demand remains uncapped. As far as I can tell, I have no idea – when people go, “That’s enough software. I don’t need more software in the world. I’m done. We’re cool. Enough software.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, useful software creates more useful software. You just come up with more ideas. “You’re you know what I want to do next? This. And then after that, I’m going to do the next thing.” You have a list. We all have backlogs out there…</p> </div> <div>
<p>Yeah. And so this whole story – the only part of this story where it gets rid of humans is the story where we’re not talking about the technology we have now, we’re talking about some other technology, that is some distant future, where between us and that distant future is the invention of fantastically new techniques that are roughly on par with the technique that brought you the one we just got, or more… And it’s probably not one of them, it’s probably dozens. And then once you think about that and you’re like “Okay, now maybe that turns into some kind of unrecognizable super-intelligence”, sure. Maybe at that point it’s Star Trek. Maybe at that point there’s replicators, and we’re post-economic… But that’s not a useful conversation when it comes down to like “I was building stuff in my home lab, and I was thinking… Could there be a great agent loop in the data center?” And you’re like “Hell yeah, there could.”</p>
<p>“You know what sucks in the data center? What sucks is trying to figure out how to look at the logs to understand what’s going on. And so maybe what I’ll do is build an agent that knows how to log into all the servers, and run journalctl, and then bring all the data down, and then do the analysis for me and tell me what’s wrong. That’d be sick.” And we could write that right now before we get off this podcast. We just do it. And it would just work, and it would be sick. And you’d be like “That was amazing!” And like, okay, that’s the thing. That’s what it i</p>
<p>I was thinking the other day about Kubernetes, and the control loop, and the bin packing, and all of those things… How would you have written Kubernetes differently if you had LLMs to drive an agent loop? I think it would be different. I think there’s a bunch of the decision-making that you would have put into a different part of the loop of the system. And I don’t know that it would be better or worse, but it’s an interesting thought experiment, to be like “Where would I put the LLM? Where would I put the deterministic side of what it does? How would that change the user experience and the user loop of what I want to do?” Like, sick. Sick. Right?</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>I don’t know what it would be, but I want that.</p> </div> <div> <p>Is that what you’re building? Are you building that?</p> </div> <div> <p>No, I’m building System Initiative [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:39:18.28">00:39:18.28</a>] I was just thinking about it.</p> </div> <div> <p>But you seemed like you were pretty passionate about that problem, so you might –</p> </div> <div> <p>I’m passionate about all these problems. I want to build all these things. I want to build the journalctl bot. I’m into all of it.</p> </div> <div> <p>I’m with you on that, I think a lot of the consternation, I’ll call it, out there, and that Adam is humanizing for us in human form here, is that the same people that have brought us the current technique and techniques are saying they have AGI techniques basically locked in their basements until Q1 of ‘26. And then they’re going to be unleashed on the world, and all hell’s going to break loose.</p> </div> <div> <p>They don’t.</p> </div> <div> <p>I mean, aren’t they, though? I mean, that’s pretty much what Anthropic’s CEO, and Sam Altman is talking about…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. They’re all talking about it, because it’s really good business to talk about it.</p> </div> <div> <p>And they just keeping those deals done, you know?</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:40:03.11">00:40:03.11</a>] They keep getting those deals done… We keep paying for those growth multiples…</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] Right.</p> </div> <div> <p>You know what I mean? And do I think it’s a dangerous game to be promising AGI? I do. I do. I do. And I think that could go bad. And also, I don’t know… Is it – it’s probably fine. [laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, I just think that these two things juxtaposed, is “It’s not a bubble”, and the people in the people non-bubble are promising a thing that you don’t think they can deliver on. I mean, to me that sounds like –</p> </div> <div> <p>I think most of what people are buying isn’t that right now. No one’s buying AGI… No one’s going to –</p> </div> <div> <p>Superintelligence. They changed the word.</p> </div> <div> <p>You’re not buying superintelligence either…</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>There’s no superintelligence to buy.</p> </div> <div> <p>I’m buying a – what do you call it…?</p> </div> <div> <p>Right now you’re buying access to the LLMs. That’s what you’re buying. And not having to run the inference on your own.</p> </div> <div> <p>A genius golden retriever on acid. That’s what I’m paying for.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, that’s basically what you’re buying now. That’s right.</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] That’s good enough for me, by the way.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, what’s amazing is the genius golden retriever on acid, if you build the system around its existence, will dramatically outperform. It’s crazy. We had somebody, they had a production outage. They had no data in System Initiative. The prompt they put in was “I’m having a production outage. Here’s the data, here’s the evidence. Go discover the infrastructure and System Initiative you need to troubleshoot it, and tell me what’s wrong.” And 15 minutes and 700 components of discovery later, it told them the bug. Ta-da! And that’s bananas. That’s crazy person talk. And it happens all the time now. It’s just not evenly distributed. Not everybody’s seen it, not everybody knows… And the ways that those systems compose - you know, if you have a big Terraform repo or whatever right now, and you try to do that same trick, it doesn’t work as well. And so you’re like “Oh, this thing… Maybe it’s the AI that’s bad. The AI didn’t figure out to go read the docs”, you know? And you’re like “Oh, I don’t think that means the AI is bad. I think it means that Adam is bad at prompting.” Adam probably should have said “Read the docs plan one, plan two, plan three.” And he’ll get better. He won’t make that mistake twice.</p> </div> <div> <p>Never again. Never again.</p> </div> <div> <p>Never again.</p> </div> <div> <p>Never make the same mistake twice. But when I talk about it not being a bubble - and I’m not defending one way or the other, the bubbly position, but I think the argument that says it isn’t is the one that says “Look, are we in a hype cycle?” Yes. Is that hype cycle reaching beyond its abilities? Yes. But we’ve had lots of hype cycles. I mean, going back to Kubernetes… Kubernetes was supposed to be the operating system now. But we’re not installing Kubernetes in these AI data centers, no matter how hard they try to convince you that you should. What people actually want is bare metal compute.</p> </div> <div> <p>Here’s the thing, though. Here’s the thing. We just went from the horse to the car. That’s what we did in our time. We’re living through the invention of the car.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s going to be crazy.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s going to be crazy.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s going to change everything.</p> </div> <div> <p>And of course, we don’t know –</p> </div> <div> <p>And there’ll be hype everywhere. Of course.</p> </div> <div> <p>And we don’t know what to do with it. We’re like “There’ll be flying cars. There’ll be space cars. What if all the cars were underground, in car tunnels, and then the whole world could be a park?” I don’t know. I’m sure we had crazy ideas. Ad yeah, what I’m ready for as a practical technologist… You know, I’m not a researcher. I don’t hang out writing papers. I build stuff, and that’s what I like to do. And what I can say as a practical technologist is “Whoa, building stuff with this kit is fun. It’s so fun!” Because it can do things that are really freaking cool, and that you could not do a year ago. And that’s epic. And I don’t know what that means, in the macro. Nobody knows really, right? But it is real. It’s not an illusion.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:44:12.16">00:44:12.16</a>] Unless you have AGI in your basement, locked up, like Sam Altman does. Then he knows.</p> </div> <div> <p>If Sam Altman had AGI locked up in his basement, Sam Altman would be doing better at delivering LLMs to us. Right?</p> </div> <div> <p>Well said.</p> </div> <div> <p>If Sam Altman had a secret AGI, ChatGPT 5 would have been a lot better.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, that’s the other thing, that people are saying on the other side, is like “Well, they aren’t getting that much better, that much faster.” But they are stinking good, I’ll tell you that much.</p> </div> <div> <p>But you also don’t need them to. Because what we’re learning about these systems is that the less you use them, the better you are.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, you build the software systems around them.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yes. It’s what you plug into them that matters.</p> </div> <div> <p>Right.</p> </div> <div> <p>And so the first stage of this was make the LLM do everything. That’s why we were all like “Make it do math.” What a ridiculous thing to ask it to do. It’s always going to be awful at f****n math. The technology is anti-math. It’s like “Oh, what am I? Random and non-deterministic.” So why do I care about whether it can do math for me when I have calculators? Why don’t I just plug in a tool that does math, and then I’m guaranteed that the math is right all the time.</p> </div> <div> <p>Brilliant.</p> </div> <div> <p>Because you know what it doesn’t do? Hallucinate numbers that it received after it received them from a tool. I’ve never seen that happen. I’ve never seen it be like “Oh, here’s the number”, and then it’s like “Oh, I changed it for you. It’s actually 72.” I’m sure it happens, but it’s not very often. But that was our first pass. Our first pass was just like “Oh, we’re going to feed everything in the world to this magical robot, and the magical robot is going to do it.” And that’s clearly dumb. It was clearly not playing to the technology strengths. And now we’re learning how to play to its strengths, but… I mean, just now learning. The last couple of months I think as an industry we’re starting to be like “Oh, that could be the way.” It might actually come together that.</p> </div> <div> <p>How has this changed how you think of things, Adam? Is there a fundamental paradigm shift in your brain?</p> </div> <div> <p>I think it’s convinced me that more of the systems that we architect around the LLM will change. So if you think about the interfaces that we provide to those systems, they’re like weird anti APIs. So the API that I would give to you as a software developer, that you would be pleased with, is not the API that I should give to an LLM, because the LLM is trained on human language and behavior… And so it dramatically outperforms when you give it these really wide interfaces, and let it explore… Who does that? That would be a terrible API design. If I told you that my API to my service was one big function call, and I was just like “Whatever…”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. “Send me some stuff.”</p> </div> <div>
<p>“Send me junk and I’ll run it for you.” You’d be like “No.” That’s a terrible design. But it turns out with AI it’s kind of a good design. And those layers are dramatic… And I think the thing that’s changed for me is that now I can’t look at problems without thinking “Well, where can I insert that essentially plain language compiler, and turn it into a loop where I’m working interactively alongside something that can help me move through this problem space?” And that’s just a dramatically different way of thinking about everything, to some degree. And that’s not how I felt about it for the first, I don’t know, year and a half of this journey, where I was just “Uhm, I don’t know.” I try it every now and again, it’s not very good… The results are mediocre… The hype cycle’s crazy… But the last six months or so - it’s tough. And it really has fundamentally changed the way I think about it.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:47:53.21">00:47:53.21</a>] With System Initiative - I mean, we took this UI that we had spent five years building, trying to be like “Here’s a better way to compose these resources”, and I just deleted it. It’s just gone. Because it turns out –</p> </div> <div> <p>[unintelligible <a href="#t=00:48:05.00">00:48:05.00</a>] stupid…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. It turns out –</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, smart with your knowledge, you know…</p> </div> <div>
<p>It turns out that what’s great is the models. What’s great is that I built these one-to-one abstractions. That was awesome. But the actual way you want to work with them is just in an AI. I just want to say to Claude Code “I need to deploy Valkey to make this session thing work. Can you update the code and then build a change set for me that does it?” And it’s like “Yeah, I got you, bro.” And then it goes and does it, and then I review its work, and I’m like “Oh yup, that was pretty right. Oh, this security group’s a little wrong. Oh, yeah, no, you got the size wrong. I want it to be a little bigger.” And we work together in this reactive loop to do it, and then it all just happens. And it turns out that whole composition UI was in the way, because it was designed not for that loop with the agent. It was designed for a human to be like “Here’s how I compose things.” And that broke my heart. I’d spent five years doing R&amp;D where I was like “Okay, crack your knuckles. I’m going to finally figure out how to give people this incredible UI to let people compose complex infrastructure.” And then as soon as I figured out the right shape of how to work with an agent, I had to delete it all, because I was like “Oh, never again.” Why would anyone work that way? You just wouldn’t. It’s so much easier to just ask the system to do it, and it just works.</p>
<p>And so the UI now is about radiating information back to you more than it is making changes. It’s like “Show me the map. Show me the review. Show me the changes. Let me dive into the details and play around.” But it’s fundamentally altered the way I think about everything, including the last six years of my life.</p> </div> <div> <p>It had to require some humility…</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh…</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, Jerod… I mean –</p> </div> <div> <p>Take us back to that moment. Take us back…</p> </div> <div> <p>So these are Buddhist prayer beads, and I’m holding onto them, doing this while I’m talking to because of that. Because I’m just like “Oh… Oh, that was awful.”</p> </div> <div> <p>You’re still in PTSD from it?</p> </div> <div> <p>I’m sorry to laugh at your pain, but it is hilarious.</p> </div> <div> <p>I’m just being honest.</p> </div> <div> <p>I love it.</p> </div> <div> <p>It was awful, man.</p> </div> <div> <p>How far away from it are you? When did you make this decision?</p> </div> <div>
<p>We started building the prototypes of working this way less than six months ago, and then shipped it maybe two months ago… So we’re just in the very beginnings of trying to get people to understand “Here’s what we’ve built, and here’s how it works.” And the humility runs in a bunch of different directions. It runs in the humility to look at what you’ve built and be like “No, it’s not right anymore. It’s not good enough anymore.” Which is really hard. It’s also that most people – you have to take people on a journey about why it would work, and why they should try it, and what that experiential loop would be like…</p>
<p>And the people I love most are infrastructure people, and those are not the people that are highest on the AI supply train. Do you know what I mean? Those people tend to be the grumpy Luddites, who are like “Never been useful to me…” So that’s also been humiliating a little bit, to go out to my people and be like “Look at what you can do if you think differently about it”, and they’re like “I don’t know.” Not only do I not want to look at it, I reject the premise that it could work at all. And that is humbling, because the right reaction to that is not for me to go sit in my tower and be like “Well, I’m just smarter than you.” It’s to figure out how to explain it better. It’s to figure out how to be like “Okay, I’ve got to get all the way down to the ground again, and just be like “Look, I know. I know, I get it.” I have to find that path of empathy to be like “Here’s–” Like, I do have to explain it to you from first principles. I do have to work you back from the very foundations of how we think about this problem. There’s just no shortcuts, and I really want there to be, because I want to put it out into the world and have everybody just fawn all over me. Because wouldn’t that be easier for me? [laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>But it’s not what happens.</p> </div> <div> <p>You can’t just manifest that, you know?</p> </div> <div> <p>You can try.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, of course.</p> </div> <div> <p>And every now and again it does. It’s every once in a while landing in a bottle, but…</p> </div> <div> <p>So that’s interesting, because the infra people are some of the most resistant to the new tech. But you couldn’t possibly continue building it the previous way.</p> </div> <div> <p>No. Because once you’ve seen it –</p> </div> <div> <p>Because the world has changed.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. It’s irresponsible. I have investors, I have my own dreams and my own hopes… I wasn’t building it – my job is to try to build something great. And that’s where the greatness is. So you’ve gotta go there. And it doesn’t matter what the risks are, because you’re guaranteed to lose the other way. You know what I mean?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it’s a losing proposition. Like, this is the only way you could win. It doesn’t mean you will, but at least you’ve got a fighting chance.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. And it’s so fun. You know, we built a policy engine that uses the MCP server to let you write policy and Markdown that describes “Hey, check my infrastructure to make sure that this policy is always applied, and then give it a search query that tells it what infrastructure to pull in.” And then the bot will go grab that infrastructure, apply the thing, and then write you a report about whether you’re compliant with your policy. And we wrote it in three hours. And that’s crazy person talk.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s such crazy person talk.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s bananas. But you know, who’s experienced that so far in industry? Me. Paul Stack who works with me. A small handful of people who are listening to this podcast who don’t work for me, who have done it themselves, and they’re like “Whoa…!”</p> </div> <div> <p>Some of them that listen to this show dream of working for you.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. Well, if you want to work for me, the first step is to buy my software. [laughter]</p> </div> <div> <p>Wasn’t it Don McKinnon, Jerod? The voicemail was for Don McKinnon, where it was that he’d [unintelligible <a href="#t=00:54:12.07">00:54:12.07</a>]</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, yeah, yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>That’s what I’m referring to. Drop a note, Jason. Give us a little tease of that.</p> </div> <div>
<p>Did you ever hear that, Adam? Don McKinnon, a Changelog listener, and now a guest - he was on the show this year - who’s a fan of yours… And he confessed his fandom to Breakmaster Cylinder for our State of the ‘log annual episode where BMC will remix people’s voicemails… And so BMC remixed a voicemail that Don left us, in which he mentioned he enjoys your episodes in particular.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:54:47.14">00:54:47.14</a>]</p>
<p><em>Hey, Jerod, Adam, and everyone at Changelog. My favorite episode of 2024 was the Changelog &amp; Friends episode “From Chef to System Initiative. I’ve been following Adam Jacob on social media for a while, and he’s always a great guest. So it was interesting to hear more about his career journey that led him to where he is now with his new company. And I did have to go back and watch Any Given Sunday after hearing that episode. I’d never seen it before.</em></p>
<p><em>I also got a kick out of the “Rails is having a moment again” episode. A lot of times I disagree with DHH, but regardless, he is always entertaining to listen to. Thank you for all the work you guys do on the podcast. It’s one of my favorites.”</em></p> </div> <div>
<p>And the BMC remix has basically Don confessing that he stalked you, and you had him thrown out of your office.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=00:55:32.12">00:55:32.12</a>]</p>
<p><em>“My favorite episode was from Chef to System Initiative. I’ve been following Adam Jacob on social media for a while… I’ve been also following Adam Jacob to work. And I got kicked out of his company. So it was interesting to hear more about his career journey that led him to kick me out of his company. And I disagree with him, but regardless, he’s always entertaining, and he’s always kicking me out.”</em></p> </div> <div> <p>It was hilarious. We’ll have to let you listen to that.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, I really do wanna listen to that.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, you should. I mean, if you want the ego boost, this is a good one for you.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=00:56:11.14">00:56:11.14</a>] Oh, that’s so fun. Yeah, I could use it after my after my humble pie of realizing I had to delete years of effort because the interface was wrong.</p> </div> <div> <p>Can we get into the practicality of - they say AI slop, right? And so you said you just did this feature in three hours, which is mind-blowing…</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>And that means that you’ve got code generated by the LLM, that you didn’t write, but you’re probably code reviewing. So I’m assuming you’re generating a lot more code, maybe a lot more prose even too around what you’re building… Because documentation - why not? When you can just generate it. Do it.</p> </div> <div> <p>To some degree, yeah</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, for sure. But what is what is it like to generate that kind of feature in that kind of timeframe, and do it well in terms of code? Do you code-review it? What’s your engineering change of practice as a result of generating so much code?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, yeah. I don’t know… It’s interesting. So that example is happening in a vacuum, where we’re basically running a little spike to be like, okay, very few people have actually built end-to-end, complicated, full lifecycle application deployments using this kind of technology, because it just is too new. And so we’re doing it ourselves, to be like “Are we right about how the best practices work? Are we are we right that this flow is better?” Those sorts of questions. And so the code quality that’s necessary on this policy bot, for example, is pretty low, because I just need it to work to see “Is this cool? Is this directionally the kind of thing you want it to be?” And so in that case, the loop is much more about just “Does it meet requirements?”</p> </div> <div> <p>Right.</p> </div> <div>
<p>And that I tend to also use AI to do. I’m like “Hey, here’s the list of requirements.” Like Playwright, or those sorts of things are great at just being like “Go prove this thing. Write me some tests.” And its purpose is really just to meet the requirements. When it comes to the actual System Initiative codebase, which is quite large - it’s a big monorepo; probably over 100,000 lines of code by now, easy… The utilization is more embedded, in that the engineers are using it in places where it makes sense, or where it will accelerate them… Sometimes they’re using it to help understand the codebase, sometimes they’re using it to write features… They’ve had great luck using it to refactor… Like, write a bigger plan, have it refactor, move in those stepwise directions…</p>
<p>I think in general what we’ve all kind of learned is that the more specific we can be, the better the outcomes are. So in the early stages of this you were trying to feed it as little as possible, and then hoping it would do magic, and then judging it when it doesn’t perform… And I think now we’ve sort of transitioned into the world where it’s more about saying “Hey, here’s this problem. I understand the problem as a person, to some degree. Here’s what I know. Now tell me what you know that confirms or disproves that hypothesis. Then we’re going to use that information to go write a plan…”</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s a dance.</p> </div> <div>
<p>And then I’m going to read the plan, and then we’re going to talk about the plan, and then you’re going to go execute on this plan, and then I’m going to see if I like what you did… And if I don’t, maybe I throw it away. And I would have never done that historically… Like, just open a branch and then have a bunch of code get written, and then be like “Nah, I didn’t like that direction. Let’s go the other way.” I do that all the time now.</p>
<p>And so that stuff has changed… But the fundamental question of like “How do you apply taste? How do you apply the right level of engineering?”, that really hasn’t changed. So a good example is the first MCP server for System Initiative actually a customer built, and had showed it to me, and I wasn’t very enthusiastic… Because quite frankly, it was bad. It was just a one-to-one mapping of the API, and it didn’t perform very well, and I was like [unintelligible <a href="#t=01:00:10.26">01:00:10.26</a>] It’s just like all the other AI stuff I’ve ever done.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=01:00:15.05">01:00:15.05</a>] And then when I started really reading about how to build them well, and what their abstractions were, suddenly it started to perform. And that’s the difference between the one that we just – you gave a prompt like “Here’s an API spec. Make me an MCP server”, which it will go do, versus saying “As a person, I understand what the interface is, and I’m going to craft this thing in a direction that is going to return better results.” And so that part of the loop is still all people. And then depending on the engineer, they’re using more or less AI in the building… But we don’t talk about it that much. And there’s certainly not a mandate one way or the other.</p> </div> <div> <p>Is there a known freedom? Like “Hey, do what you want.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>Sweet.</p> </div> <div> <p>Like, I’m just going to give you a license to Claude Code, or you want to use VS Code and run Copilot, what I’m going to do is pay you the same way that when you come work for me I’ll buy you whatever keyboard you want…</p> </div> <div> <p>Right.</p> </div> <div> <p>Like, I don’t care. And people are often like “Oh, any keyboard?” And I’m like “Yeah, any keyboard.” And they’re like “Well, what if it’s this really expensive keyboard, and I want custom key caps from Japan, with little emoji apples on them?” And I’m like “Any keyboard. I don’t care.” Because what I want you to have is the thing you’re going to put your fingers on it all day, and every time you put your fingers on it, I want you to be like “Oh, I love being here, doing this thing.” And so if me spending an extra a hundred bucks on a keyboard makes you feel great about your job, I want to spend a hundred bucks, so you feel great about your job, and stay longer.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah… There’s this custom keyboard, Adam, that I want… Well, I don’t really want it. It just looks beautiful… I would never spend the money on it. I’m just kind of curious –</p> </div> <div> <p>Which one is that?</p> </div> <div> <p>I can’t remember the name of it, but it’s… I’m past my research of it, but…</p> </div> <div> <p>I see.</p> </div> <div> <p>It’s not in my brain space anymore.</p> </div> <div> <p>He already denied himself and moved on.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, he already said no.</p> </div> <div> <p>[unintelligible <a href="#t=01:02:01.09">01:02:01.09</a>]</p> </div> <div> <p>When I tell you the number you’re gonna know why. It was like over $400 to build this custom keyboard.</p> </div> <div> <p>Hey man, I’ve been running it Kinesis Advantage keyboards since the early 2000s, and easy 300 bucks, 400 bucks. Saved my wrists, changed my life…</p> </div> <div> <p>Right. Some things you don’t want to go cheap on.</p> </div> <div> <p>I think in this case though it wasn’t about ergonomics, though. It was about look. It was about aesthetics more so.</p> </div> <div> <p>Oh, you like the look of it.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, it was like a Lamborghini.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. It was about how it looked, not how it functioned.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, you were like “That looks awesome. And I want mine.”</p> </div> <div> <p>It looks cool.</p> </div> <div>
<p>It has spinning rims.</p>
<p><strong>Break</strong>: [<a href="#t=01:02:41.28">01:02:41.28</a>]</p> </div> <div> <p>Do you feel like a babysitter of this AI? Because I’ve had this idea that we don’t have enough babysitters. Or we get to a point where we need taste… You need the LLM to generate, you need the speed at which it knows and can learn, the collaborative fabric that you just described… But then you’ve got a limit of people who got an understanding of how to direct that thing, and then babysit that thing. Because that takes human time, not human effort necessarily.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah…</p> </div> <div> <p>You need to have that tasteful babysitting mentality… And I just wonder if we’re going to run out of babysitters anytime soon.</p> </div> <div> <p>I don’t think so… My experience is it’s a different kind of flow. The kind of flow where I’m sitting down and writing code, and I’m just going to write code for eight hours a day, which now that I’m saying it I kind of miss… And so I’m like “Oh, I wonder when I could – maybe I’ll go back to that.” But the flow state is there as well when working with AI tooling… But it’s a different flow state, because what’s happening is the bounce between the conversation, the source code, the decision-making process… You know, the loop is a little different. But it doesn’t feel like babysitting, because babysitting sort of implies –</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, it’s babysitting once it starts going. Making the plan is fun. But the plan being baked and then it doing, and then you confirming that is totally babysitting.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, but what’s changed is that now I don’t watch.</p> </div> <div> <p>Okay… [laughs] YOLO.</p> </div> <div>
<p>But it’s not even YOLO. What it’s opening up is that there’s multiple avenues at once, and the agent will tell me when it needs my attention. And so I’m not waiting around, waiting for the agent to finish… I’m off doing other stuff. And that flows is very weird. In one part of the flow what I’m doing is working on that policy feature, and the other I’m working on a different feature, and I’m doing it at the same time, because there’s multiple things that I’m driving all at once. And then I have code open, because there’s another piece of the system where I need it to be really specific… And so the context switching I’m doing is different.</p>
<p>But yeah, when I started using these tools, I did a lot more babysitting than I do now. I did a lot of just like “Oh… Will it?” And I’m waiting for the drop. And now I’m not. I’m just expecting the drop. And I’m like [unintelligible <a href="#t=01:06:50.21">01:06:50.21</a>] Like, okay, it’s off doing its thing. What am I going to do now? Oh, I guess I’ll go do this. And then a little pop-up happens in the corner of my desktop, and it’s like “Claude needs your attention.” And I’m like “Okay, which one?” And then away we go.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah.</p> </div> <div> <p>But I don’t feel like I’m doing a lot of babysitting. I feel like I’m doing a lot of – it feels like engineering. It’s different, but it definitely feels like engineering to me.</p> </div> <div> <p>I would agree, and maybe it’s because I don’t like to plan very much, and so I feel more like I’m iterating with it doing the work, and me just… I don’t want to use the word “babysitting”, because then Adam will be right…</p> </div> <div> <p>Ha-hah!</p> </div> <div> <p>[laughs] I’m not babysitting so much as I’m just directing. I’m directing the work. And I’m waiting for it to be ready for the next direction, or the review…</p> </div> <div> <p>Traffic cop maybe is a better analogy.</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. Well –</p> </div> <div> <p>You need more traffic cops.</p> </div> <div>
<p>The volume of parallelism that you can get out of this is crazy high. It’s another way that all the systems that we drive will have to change. Source code is a great example. You know what sucks in the current model? It can hallucinate syntax. And there’s no way to know until late in the game, until I run a compiler loop, or I run a lint. So how long before somebody takes a good idea that was something like Unison, where when you’re programming, the source code itself gets translated into an underlying data structure that then you can perform transformations on… Where now when the LLM proposes a line of code, it gets automatically linted, it gets automatically vetted at the moment of injection, as opposed to writing to a file.</p>
<p>[<a href="#t=01:08:27.16">01:08:27.16</a>] And how much more efficient will that make that loop? …because instead of it waiting for the compile loop and the AI wrote bad code, the AI will know it wrote bad code immediately, at the moment it wrote bad code, then get corrected by the compiler. The compiler would be like “Oh, you did it wrong”, and then it will just loop around. Like, no one’s ever built that loop yet, but someone’s building it. I’m not like the first person who’s thought of this…</p> </div> <div> <p>No.</p> </div> <div> <p>And that loop - that’s what I mean when I’m like “Oh, it’s going to change a lot about how we think about how these systems are constructed.” Because once you start designing the system to make that loop delicious, it’s going to be real different than, like, I’m going to crank off 10,000 lines of source code, run the compiler, hope it works, see if the linter functions… You know what I mean? That’s working, which is amazing. But if you want to make the user experience an order of magnitude better, you have to get crazier with the fundamentals… And so what’s the first postmodern programming language look like that was built with LLMs in mind? I have no idea, but it’s different than Python, you know?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah, how would you – can you think about that a little bit? I didn’t even think about a new language, post AI, and being AI-native, really, to use a popular term out there.</p> </div> <div>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I haven’t thought about it a ton, but the first example was one I’ll go back to, which is when the AI agents perform better, they perform better when the feedback loops are closer at hand. So when they hallucinate, which you know they will do, you have to correct the hallucination. And so right now, the hallucination loop gets corrected when you run lint, or when you run the compiler, or when you run tests. And so what would change if instead of having the interface “Write to a file and put in some words”, instead it was like “Write these lines of code”, that gets turned into structured information that gets fed to another structured data source, and now you’re doing a transformation to the underlying codebase, which can then automatically understand the context in which the change was made, and then evaluate whether or not it fits on some set of policy about how the system would work, and then feed back to the LLM immediately, “That was terrible code. Don’t do that.” And that loop - that’s the loop. That’s how these systems are going to get better.</p>
<p>And what do you have to do in programming language land to make that loop be good? I don’t know, because I’m not a programming language guy, I’m a practical technology guy. But Unison, for example, does this with a database, where when you write code in Unison, it synchronizes up to this big database that makes a hash of every function and every variable, and then builds a big Merkle tree of all of those things… And if I was building AI around Unison, I would use the hell out of that to make it so when it writes new Unison code, it immediately tells me whether my code was good or bad, whether it worked, knew how to revert… You know? You could do crazy things, that are just not even feasible in the current model. But most of us aren’t thinking at that level yet, because we have more practical things in front of us.</p> </div> <div> <p>Well, I think some are because of the AI slop, right? Like, that kind of prevents – if you could perfect that world, even if you didn’t go AI-native, which is to rebuild from the ground up with AI mind… Even if you took like Rust, or Python, and said “Look, let’s bolt on that kind of world.”</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. If you could figure it out…</p> </div> <div> <p>When you run Cargo, it does that job. There’s a better feedback loop. Assuming the build is being run by an agent being led or directed by a human - if that assumption is true, yeah.</p> </div> <div>
<p>[<a href="#t=01:12:16.25">01:12:16.25</a>] Yeah. Yeah. And that’s what I mean when I say that it’s all – the technology we have now… I don’t need AGI for that. I don’t need the bubble to pop. I don’t need any more technology than the one I already have. We could build that right now. The only thing that’s in our way is that we haven’t been willing to reimagine those parts of the system yet, because there’s a bunch of practical reasons you shouldn’t. Oh, you’re going to invent a new programming language? “Pry Python from my cold dead hand…”</p>
<p>I talk to people all day who hate infrastructure as code. That’s their opening gambit when they talk to me, and they’re still a little hesitant to get rid of it. You know what I mean? So it would be even harder in those cases. But that doesn’t mean anything… You do it anyway, because doing it anyway is the way we figure it out. It’s the way we move forward. It’s the way that we get to the other side of like “What is –” That’s the fun part of being able to build technology from scratch.</p>
<p>And yeah, I don’t know – I think that conversation we just had about programming languages, we could have it in every piece of the stack. We could have it in every industry, and every vertical… Essentially everywhere. And we don’t need any new technology at all to do it. None. We have all of it right now.</p> </div> <div> <p>Does that just feed into the obvious beast of OpenAI, Anthropic, those folks having – I said tollbooth before, in a different podcast… This idea that we now have to pay the piper to play the game of software development, essentially. It’s like, okay, if an LLM or some sort of agentic tool is par for the course when it comes to being an engineer, and if that’s true, if we’re building everything around that paradigm, then that means that their moat gets thicker, better, more awesome, potentially… Certainly their pockets get deeper, because we’re giving them even more reasons to give them more money.</p> </div> <div>
<p>For sure. But that’ll create new incentives for us to be like “Well, wouldn’t it be better if we didn’t have to pay Anthropic all this money? Wouldn’t it be better if you could run it on your desktop?” Because the loop would be better… The reason we’re building AI data centers to do inference is because we need high bandwidth to the inference mechanisms. So what are we – like, we’ll start thinking about how do we build a hybrid inference models that use my local resources, but then also move to the other side. How will the PC change because of the shape of that need of inference?</p>
<p>So yes, I think it’ll grow their moat, it’ll do all those things… But then what it’ll do is create a new opportunity, which is “Why am I paying all this money to Anthropic all the time? Wouldn’t it be better if - blah, blah, blah, blah?” And around the cycle will go. It won’t be like an end game state, where it’s like “Oh, and –” But like, will they be big? Yeah, I think they will, and I think it’s going to be even more – I think they’ll own more real estate than people are giving them credit for. Right now, people are kind of convinced that the agent part is going to live outside of the Anthropics or the Open AIs… And I think if you’ve tried to build an agent from scratch in the last six months or less, you’ve had a pretty good time. If it was before then, if you were like using Langchain or something, it was less good… And I think if you look at the – like, Anthropic has a Claude SDK, which basically just wraps up Claude Code and then lets you program that as the agent loop, instead of writing your own agent loop… That thing is crazy good. You just include it as an Npm library, and then you don’t write any of the loop. You’re just like “Here’s my system prompt, here’s the query, here’s the tools I want, plug in some MCP, run.” And then it does, and then you’re done, and it took you no time at all… Crazy good.</p> </div> <div> <p>[<a href="#t=01:15:59.13">01:15:59.13</a>] Yeah, so the agent client protocol that Zed came out with, and is starting to get deployed out there is basically leaning into that, where it’s like “We’re making an awesome editor. We don’t want to write the agent, we just want somebody who’s putting all this effort into the agent, make the agent awesome, and we’ll plug into that.” So they’re basically seeding that real estate back to Anthropic.</p> </div> <div> <p>I think everybody should. The way we should think about the agent is glue. That’s the thing I’ve been – that’s my pithy sentence that I’m trying to get everyone to repeat, is “The agent is glue.” Think of it like a Perl script that you wrote. See, I’ve aged myself again.</p> </div> <div> <p>What’s that again? What’s Perl? [laughter]</p> </div> <div> <p>Perl used to run the internet. We all had the – I’m so sorry. Anyway… Think of it like the script that you write. That’s more what agents are going to be. But the first generation of this, we were all like “Oh, we’ll build custom embedded agents. They’ll be on autopilot.” There’s all these startups that are like “I built autopilot agents, and our special value prop is that our secret agent can do this thing that your stuff can’t do, because of all of our whiz-bangy hoo-ha stuff. That’s why it’s trapped inside of our platform walls.” All that’s going to get obliterated is my prediction, because the agent is glue. And it turns out that your closed wall agent is actually terrible… Because if you expose the capabilities to my agent, now I could use it to orchestrate my problem, which is exactly what I’m going to do. It’s glue. What I want is CPAN. I want Ruby gems. I want Npm. And then I want to write my own agent that uses those things to orchestrate my problem, which it’s really good at. And so yeah, the agent is glue, that’s the future. And so when you see people –</p> </div> <div> <p>So how does that show itself in System Init today? Is it just using Claude Code, or…?</p> </div> <div> <p>Yeah. It shows itself by me not embedding the agent, and not trying to build a wall.</p> </div> <div> <p>Right.</p> </div> <div> <p>So my moat is that I build – I have the best deterministic system to be driven by an agent. If what you want to do right now is manage infrastructure in AWS, or in Azure soon, or in other places, what you’re going to do is use System Initiative within an agent and you’re going to have it do stuff like “Go discover your infrastructure. Propose changes. Do it in safe change sets.” All of that stuff that we do, that’s the magical sauce. And when you connect it up to the agent loop - incredible. But you don’t want me to hand you a proprietary agent that tries to do all of the things. What you want to do is build an agent that plugs into your ServiceNow help desk that closes the loop for your compliance structure, that says when that change set gets merged, you’re compliant with SOC-2. And I couldn’t possibly build that feature for you, because I have no idea how you did it. But you know, and the agent is glue.</p> </div> <div> <p>Mm-hm. So how much sauce is there in System Initiative that’s not the agent doing things?</p> </div> <div> <p>A ridiculous amount of sauce. Like six years of R&amp;D sauce. Hundreds of thousands of lines of source code… [laughs]</p> </div> <div> <p>What kind of stuff are you doing – what are you bringing to the table that I couldn’t get by plugging Claude into EC2, or something?</p> </div> </div> </section> </div></div>

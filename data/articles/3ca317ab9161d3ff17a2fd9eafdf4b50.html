						<p>Another chance for you to score a whole lot of games, while also supporting charity in the "No ICE in Minnesota" <a href="https://itch.io/b/3484/no-ice-in-minnesota" target="_blank">bundle on itch.io</a>. They're hoping to raise at least $500,000, with $238,575.59 raised at time of writing this little bit.</p>
<p>From the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We created this bundle to raise funds for <a href="https://www.ilcm.org/">Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota</a> in response to the Trump administration sending ICE agents to the Minneapolis area and the reckless murder of an innocent people by ICE agents. ILCM provides free immigration legal representation to low-income immigrants and refugees in Minnesota and North Dakota. They also work to educate the community about immigration matters and advocates for public policies which respect the universal human rights of immigrants. ILCM provides services based on capacity and has a generally high demand for services. The more we are able to fundraise, the more people they will be able to assist."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire bundle costs $10, which is quite the steal for what's included. Honestly it's worth it alone for <em>Baba Is You</em>, which remains as one of my all-time favourite puzzle games for its brilliant design.</p>
<p>Some other fun picks in the bundle include <em>A Good Snowman is Hard To Build</em>, <em>APICO</em> and <em>Mudborne.</em> </p>

<p>See the bundle on <a href="https://itch.io/b/3484/no-ice-in-minnesota" target="_blank">the itch.io store</a>.</p>

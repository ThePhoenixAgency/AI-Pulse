<p><strong>Key Insights (AI-assisted):</strong><br>
Telecare’s expansion to 24.2 million users by 2030 signals that connected care is becoming a core mainstream IoT vertical, not a niche assistive segment. As platforms shift from panic-button alerts to AI-driven behavioural analytics, value creation moves from hardware margins to data, algorithms and recurring services. This favours vendors with cloud, interoperability and integration capabilities over pure device makers. The pivot toward preventive, person-centric care aligns telecare with broader IoT trends in ambient intelligence and outcome-based healthcare models.
</p>
<h2>Telecare Market Shifts Toward AI-Enabled, Preventive and Person-Centric Connected Care Solutions</h2>
<p>Berg Insight has found in its latest research that around 9.7 million people in Europe and 6.5 million people in North America were using <strong>telecare</strong> or <strong>medical alert solutions</strong> at the end of 2025. The figures include users of both in-home and mobile systems.</p>
<p>Until 2030, Berg Insight forecasts that the number of telecare users will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4 percent to reach 24.2 million in the two regions. The market value of telecare solutions in Europe reached at the same time € 3.9 billion in 2025. The market value is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.6 percent in the next five years to reach € 5.6 billion at the end of the forecast period. The market value for medical alert solutions in North America is expected to grow from € 3.4 billion (US$ 3.7 billion) in 2025 to € 5.1 billion (US$ 5.6 billion) in 2030.</p>
<p>Berg Insight’s definition of <strong>telecare solutions</strong>, also known as <strong>medical alert systems</strong> or <strong>PERS (personal emergency response systems)</strong>, is a service aimed for elderly, disabled and vulnerable people to seek help from home in the event of an emergency. These solutions can trigger an alarm when the user presses a button or when a passive sensor detects activity that deviates from the normal. These systems provide continuous in-home or completely mobile monitoring services and can consist of a range of electronic devices such as personal alarm buttons, motion detection sensors, GPS monitors or fitness devices. The market evolves to include AI solutions that automatically trigger an alarm for instance when a user leaves home at an unexpected time or forgets to take his or her medicine.</p>
<p>The <strong>telecare market</strong> in Europe and North America is served by range of companies providing hardware devices, software platforms and monitoring services. In Europe, Tunstall, Legrand, TeleAlarm (Assa Abloy), Careium and Chubb are among the leading solution providers. Tunstall, Legrand and TeleAlarm have strong presence across the European region. Careium is a leading market player in the Nordic region and also has strong presence in the UK. Chubb Community Care has a strong footprint in the UK market. Companies such as Assa Abloy, Ascom, Attentive (Solem), Beghelli, Chiptech, Climax Technology, Essence Group, MiniFinder, Navigil (Twig Com), Nobi and Telecom Design are key telecare equipment vendors. Enovation (Legrand Care), Skyresponse and Azur Soft are prominent providers of telecare monitoring software solutions. </p>

<p>Additional key vendors active across the European telecare ecosystem, covering software platform providers, service operators and connected device specialists include 2iC-Care, Access Group, Everon, Genus Care, Just Checking, Libify, Sensio, SmartLife Care, Tellu, Telegrafik, Urmet and Vivago. In North America, integrated and platform-led solutions are provided by Aloe Care Health, Becklar Personal Health &amp; Safety, Connect America, Life Alert Emergency Response, Lively, LogicMark, Mytrex, Medical Guardian and QMedic. </p>
<p>Another group consists of monitoring-led service providers that bundle monitoring subscriptions with branded or third-party medical alert equipment focusing on monitoring operations and service delivery. Examples include ADT, Alert1, Bay Alarm Medical and ModivCare. The market includes specialised equipment vendors that design and manufacture medical alert hardware and sensing technologies such as Climax Technology, Essence Group, Numera (Malar Company) and Vayyar Imaging.</p>
<p>Vatsala Raina, IoT analyst at Berg Insight, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The telecare market is evolving from standalone PERS devices to comprehensive safety-and-care platforms. Solution Providers now deliver continuous wellbeing support, combining monitoring, prevention, response and follow-up care.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The European and North American markets for <strong>personal emergency response systems</strong> are supported by several trends and developments that will impact the competitive landscape in the next years. The silver generation is becoming increasingly technologically savvy and more willing to adopt solutions that support everyday independent living. Solution providers are integrating AI and machine learning algorithms to analyse monitoring data, understand users’ daily routines, detect irregularities and trigger timely assistance. Predictive analytics models further enable preventive and proactive care by assessing fall risk based on historical behaviour and health conditions, supporting earlier interventions and improved safety outcomes. </p>
<p><em>“The telecare industry is undergoing a shift, moving beyond reactive emergency response towards preventive and proactive care. The focus is now on anticipating risk and supporting independence rather than intervening only after an incident occurs”</em>, concluded Mrs. Raina. </p>
<p>The industry is becoming more person-centric, driven by data-led decision-making and improved interoperability across connected care solutions.</p> </div></div>

The <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/672681/list-of-all-macos-versions-including-the-latest-macos.html">current version of macOS</a> is <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html">macOS 26</a>, and Apple runs a beta program, which means developers and registered public testers can try out new features before they are released to the general public later in the year.</p> <p>The beta process doesn’t stop with the full release of macOS in the fall. After macOS 26 Tahoe arrived on Macs in September 2025, development continued with new features rolled out every couple of months.</p> <p>In this article, we’ll explain what you need to do to get your hands on a copy of the new beta of macOS 26, how to install it, and what you should bear in mind if you want to avoid problems. (If you would prefer to use the latest official release of macOS, here’s <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html">how to update macOS on your Mac</a>.)</p> <p><em><strong>Update February 16, 2026: </strong>Apple released the macOS 26.4 beta.</em></p> <h2>macOS beta: Latest version</h2> <p>The most recent version of the macOS 26 Tahoe developer beta is version 26.4. It was released on February 16, 2025.</p> <p>Following <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html">WWDC 2025</a> on June 9, the macOS 26 developer beta is now available to download for those signed up to the program. The “macOS 26” name is part of a coherent annual naming system along with <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2575705/ios-19-features-release-date-beta.html">iOS 26</a> and <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2766625/ipados-19-release-date-compatilbity-features-beta.html">iPadOS 26</a>.</p> <div><figure><img src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/macos-Tahoe-beta-Software-Update.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all" alt="macOS Tahoe Beta Software Update"></figure><p>Foundry</p></div> <h2>macOS beta: Next beta update</h2> <p>New betas tend to arrive every one to two weeks, and more frequently as the full release data approaches.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html">beta testing program</a> will continue to run after the new macOS 26 software launches in September or October 2025, with Apple continuing to roll out new features. </p> <p>To get the developer version of the macOS 26 beta, you need to be running macOS Sequoia and be registered for Apple’s developer program, either having paid $99/£79 to enroll in Apple’s Developer program (<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/programs/&amp;xcust=1-1-671123-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html" target="_blank">here</a>) or with a free developer account (follow the instructions below for how to register for that).</p> <p>Alternatively, if it’s the public beta you are after, you just need to sign up for the Public Beta program on <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/&amp;xcust=1-1-671123-1-0-0-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html" target="_blank">Apple’s beta webpage</a>, sign the NDA, and enroll your Mac. Details of how to do that are below.</p> <p>As long as you are a registered developer or enrolled in the public beta program, when the relevant macOS Beta becomes available, it will also show up on your Mac.</p> <p>Before you download the beta, a few warnings:</p> <ul>
<li>We strongly advise that if you aren’t a developer, you don’t download the developer beta.</li> <li>We also strongly recommend that you back up your Mac before you upgrade to the macOS beta.</li> <li>We recommend that you do not run the macOS beta on your primary Mac; ideally, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/672589/how-to-dual-boot-mac-run-macos-together.html">run it in a separate volume</a>. This should minimize any risks to you.</li>
</ul> <h2>How to get a free Apple developer account</h2> <p>If you just want a free Apple Developer account so you can access the beta, you can get this via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app on an iPhone:</p> <ol>

<div><p><span>1.</span></p><h3>Who can run the macOS beta?</h3> <div>
<p>Anyone can run the macOS beta, but to do so, you do need to register for either the developer beta, the pubic beta, or both.</p> <p>Apple offers both developer and public beta programs for macOS, enabling all interested users to test pre-release versions of the operating system. While both betas provide early access to new features, they cater to different user profiles based on technical expertise and risk tolerance. Beta software tends to be buggy so the more stable public beta version may be preferable, but even that will not be bug-free.</p> <p>In the past, the developer beta was only available to developers who had paid to join Apple’s Developer Program (which costs $99/£79). However, for a couple of years now, Apple has opened up the developer beta to registered developers with free developer accounts. We explain how to get a free developer account below. </p> <p>If you decide you no longer want to run the beta version of macOS read this: <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/673127/how-to-remove-macos-beta-from-a-mac.html">How to remove the macOS beta</a>.</p>
</div>
</div> <div><p><span>2.</span></p><h3>macOS public beta vs developer beta</h3> <div>
<p>Since 2023, the Developer Beta has been available to anyone who registers as a developer, even if they aren’t a paid-up member of Apple’s Developer Program. As a result, people with a basic free developer account can download the new macOS developer beta (we show you how to register below).</p> <p>Whether you should download the developer beta if you aren’t a developer is another question. We don’t recommend you install the developer beta if you aren’t a developer. Instead, our recommendation is to use the public beta (the first version of which usually arrives in July).</p> <p>There are a few differences between the public and developer betas. The public beta is not the same as the beta that is released through the developer program. The public beta typically launches after the developer beta has undergone initial testing and refinement</p> <p>Developers get updates to their beta first, and possibly more frequently. But you should keep in mind that betas are by nature not stable, and because the public beta comes after the developer beta it could be a little safer to install. </p> <p>The most significant difference is probably the motive of the testers: Developers usually have the aim of ensuring their apps work when the updated macOS is released to the general public, while public beta testers are essentially helping Apple detect bugs and offering feedback on the features. Because of this, developers may get to test new features not available in the public beta.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you want to get the public beta the first thing you need to do, if you haven’t already, is join Apple’s beta programs read this for more information: <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html">How to become an Apple beta tester.</a></p>
</div>
</div> <div><p><span>3.</span></p><h3>Is the macOS beta stable?</h3> <div>
<p>By its nature, a beta has the potential to be unstable. Therefore, it’s not advised that you install it on a Mac that you rely on. If you have a second Mac that isn’t mission-critical, then install it there. We strongly recommend that you don’t risk all by putting the macOS beta on your primary macOS, especially not in the early days of the beta development.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you don’t have a second Mac, there are a couple of ways you could run macOS beta on your Mac without running the risk of losing data or finding your Mac stops working:</p> <ul>
<li>We recommend installing it on a partition, which these days is really a volume (and is much easier to create than a partition was). Read about how to do that here: <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/672589/how-to-dual-boot-mac-run-macos-together.html">How to dual-boot Mac: Run two versions of macOS on a Mac</a>.</li> <li>Alternatively, you could <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/672585/how-to-install-macos-on-an-external-drive.html">install the macOS beta on an external drive</a> and run it on that.</li>
</ul> <p>We discuss the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html">safety of the macOS beta and the risks you might be taking</a> in more detail in a separate article.</p> <p>If the stability of the beta worries you, then you are probably better off waiting until the final version is out, or at least waiting until testing has been happening for a few months before getting the beta.</p>
</div>
</div> <div><p><span>4.</span></p><h3>How to prepare your Mac for the beta</h3> <div>
<p><strong>Update your software</strong>: We recommend you have the latest full version of macOS installed, although Apple says that the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility requires macOS 10.8 or later.</p> <p><strong>Make space:</strong> We’d recommend at least 15GB of available space because the macOS betas tend to be very large. If you end up requiring more space, read: How to free up space on Mac. Note that we always recommend that you have at least 10% space free on your Mac at any time, so if you don’t have that, expect problems!</p> <p><strong>Back up</strong>: Before you install a beta on your Mac, you should make a backup of your data and files. You can find <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/670470/how-to-set-up-a-time-capsule.html">out how to use Time Machine to back up your Mac</a>. We also have a round-up<a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/668696/best-mac-backup-software.html"> of suitable backup solutions</a>.</p>
</div>
</div> <div><p><span>5.</span></p><h3>How to send feedback to Apple</h3> <div>
<p>Should you come across an error or a bug, you should use the Feedback Assistant app to provide feedback to Apple. Launch the app and follow the appropriate steps, selecting the area about which you’re providing feedback and then any specific sub-area. Then describe your issue in a single sentence, before providing a more detailed description, including any specific steps that reproduce the issue. You’ll also be able to attach other files.</p> <p>You’ll also have to give permission for the Feedback Assistant app to collect diagnostic information from your Mac.</p> <p>It won’t always be obvious whether something is a bug or just not as easy to use as you might have hoped. Either way, if your feedback is that something appears to work in an illogical way, Apple will want to know that.</p> <p>If you are having trouble with a third-party app, you can let Apple know by reporting it through the 3rd-party Application Compatibility category in the Feedback Assistant. However, we’d suggest that you also provide feedback to the app’s developer, who will no doubt be grateful.</p>
</div>
</div> <div><p><span>6.</span></p><h3>Will I be able to update from macOS beta to the final version?</h3> <p>Beta users will be able to install the final build of the OS on release day without needing to reformat or reinstall.</p>
</div> <div><p><span>7.</span></p><h3>Can I talk about the beta publicly?</h3> <div>
<p>According to Apple and the license agreement all beta testers must agree to, the beta is “Apple confidential information”. By accepting those terms, you agree not to discuss your use of the software with anyone who isn’t also in the Beta Software Program. That means you can’t “blog, post screenshots, tweet, or publicly post information about the public beta software.”</p> <p>However, you can discuss any information that Apple has publicly disclosed; the company says that information is no longer considered confidential.</p>
</div>
</div> <div><p><span>8.</span></p><h3>How to downgrade from the macOS beta</h3> <div>
<p>You can always revert to an earlier version of macOS, though depending on how you back up, it’s not necessarily a painless process.</p> <p>Start by making sure the data on your drive is backed up, then erase the drive and install the latest public version of macOS. When you first start up your Mac, you can use the Migration Assistant to import your data from the backup. Here’s a more detailed <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/673127/how-to-remove-macos-beta-from-a-mac.html">tutorial on downgrading from the macOS beta</a> and we also have a tutorial on <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/671318/how-to-downgrade-macos-revert-back.html">downgrading to an older version of the Mac OS</a>.</p>

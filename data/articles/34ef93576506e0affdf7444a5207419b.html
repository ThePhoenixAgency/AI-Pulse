<p><strong>Key Insights (AI-assisted):</strong><br />
Extending compliant connected-car services into tightly regulated GCC markets highlights how cellular IoT value is shifting from pure connectivity to orchestration of local compliance, data routing and policy enforcement. For automakers, this model reduces the operational burden of managing fragmented regulatory regimes while still enabling software-defined vehicle roadmaps and cross-border services. For operators, it underlines the importance of global-local alliances and eSIM-like “localisation” to remain relevant in automotive IoT. This move reinforces the trend toward centralized IoT platforms abstracting regional complexity for global OEM deployments.

<h2>Vodafone IoT delivers regulatory-compliant in-car connectivity to support Hyundai Motor Group’s Middle East rollout</h2>
<p>Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai, Kia, Genesis) has partnered with Vodafone IoT to deploy regulatory-compliant in-car connectivity to Bahrain, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the Middle East. In collaboration with Vodafone IoT’s network partners in the region – such as e&amp; UAE – Hyundai Motor Group will receive reliable and secure in-car connectivity that is compliant with local laws.</p>
<p>Vodafone IoT provides Hyundai Motor Group with seamless <strong>in-car connectivity in the Middle East</strong>, thanks to its <strong>Global SIM+</strong> solution – which dynamically turns its Global IoT SIM into a local SIM. This offers local network credentials, data routing, compliance with national laws and seamless cross-border connectivity – making it easier and more efficient for carmakers and manufacturers to launch services in regulated countries, as well as giving them global access to connected services. </p>
<p>These capabilities are strengthened by Vodafone IoT’s partnerships with local network providers – such as e&amp; UAE – who assure compliance, provide network resilience and reliable connectivity. Together, the network partners provide extensive coverage in the region, advanced IoT capabilities, and deep local expertise – enhancing the quality and reliability of Hyundai Motor Group’s connected services in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Combined with Vodafone IoT’s leading managed connectivity platform which integrates directly into the local network partner’s infrastructure, manufacturers can manage their global IoT estate from a single platform – giving them truly global reach and centralised control over their operations.</p>
<p>Building on these capabilities, Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis customers in the Middle East will gain access to a wide range of connected car features, including remote vehicle control, real-time status monitoring, and enhanced convenience services. This partnership aims to deliver a seamless and intuitive digital experience, empowering drivers to manage and keep their vehicles safe anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Vodafone IoT and Hyundai</strong> plan to expand their in-car connectivity partnership to new countries within the Middle East and Africa in the near future.</p>
<p>Erik Brenneis, CEO of Vodafone IoT, said: <em>“As manufacturers look to deploy connected vehicles in diverse geographies, it is vitally important that they are provided with connectivity that’s reliable, secure, and compliant with national regulations. We are proud to partner with Hyundai Motor Group to deliver innovative in car connectivity powered by our Global SIM+ which provides local credentials and a seamless cross border service. It turns vehicles into secure connected platforms – keeping drivers and passengers safe, informed and connected. Together, we will extend these capabilities to more countries and more cars, shaping the future of connected mobility.”</em></p>
<p>Hyunwoo Go, Head of Connectivity Business team, Hyundai Motor Group, said:  <em>“The launch of Connected Car Services in the Middle East, aligned with the Software-Defined Vehicle strategy of Hyundai Motor Group, represents a meaningful step toward delivering intelligent, personalized mobility experiences — empowering our customers with seamless connectivity and regionally tailored digital services that will redefine how they interact with their vehicles.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Thanks to Vodafone IoTs leading managed connectivity platform, we are not just connecting cars; we are connecting people to a world of new possibilities, making their lives easier, safer, and more enjoyable by combining our leadership in automotive innovation with Vodafone’s expertise in IoT.”</em></p>

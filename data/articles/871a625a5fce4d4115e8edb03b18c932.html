<strong>Local Government Information Unit</strong> (LGIU), a thinktank covering this sector, has issued a statement saying the government should never have proposed postponing the 30 council elections in the first place.</p><p>It also says the government has been playing “fast and loose” with democracy, and it says the U-turn has made the elections harder to run for councils and political parties.</p><p>It says:</p><blockquote> <p>The government should remember that running an election is difficult. As years of our research have shown, the fact that elections are safe and reliable despite severe time and resource constraints is only because of the extraordinary efforts put in by electoral administrators. This most recent announcement means that 30 councils will now have to run elections within an even more constrained timetable. This risks the successful delivery of elections in all of these places, not to mention the additional strain it will needlessly add to the workloads of dedicated staff. On the political side, many parties will now be scrabbling around to find candidates they didn’t think they needed. It’s reckless of the government to play fast and loose with the foundations of democracy.</p> <p>Those councils undergoing local government reorganisation are trying to implement the biggest change in local governance for a generation. This is a project of massive complexity being delivered under intense pressure in challenging timescales. They deserve to have confidence that the government will deliver on its side of the process and not just keep changing its mind. Today’s announcement will further dent councils’ confidence in the government’s consistency of purpose.</p>
</blockquote></article><article><header></header><p>In a post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/votingrules.bsky.social/post/3meyhsrqkz22m">on Bluesky</a> <strong>Heather Green</strong>, a legal academic, points out that the government has already laid<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2026/96/introduction/made#f00001"> the statutory instrument</a> delaying these elections. That will have to be annulled.</p><blockquote> <p>Government has already laid before Parliament the SI cancelling the 30 local elections. It takes effect from 27 Feb &amp; will need to be annulled when Parliament comes back from recess next week. Was laid 5 Feb, after 20 Jan hearing in Reform’s JR.</p>
</blockquote></article><article><header><h2>Farage says Steve Reed should resign after proposing local election delays that would have been unlawful</h2></header><p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Reform UK</a> leader, has said that the government backed down on postponing local elections because they “obviously knew they were going to lose” if his judicial review went to court.</p><p>Speaking to broadcasters, he claimed this was also the view of the Electoral Commission, based on an interview its chief executive gave to the Daily Telegraph at the end of last week.</p><p><strong>Vijay Rangarajan</strong> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2026/02/13/election-delays-are-wrong-says-watchdog/">told the paper</a>, which was running a campaign to get the decision to postpone the elections overturned, that the government did not have a “sufficient reason” to justify the elections not going ahead. He said:</p><blockquote> <p>We would hope that no government would go and say that somehow elections are fungible with other parts of council money. It’s a fundamental point that they have to run elections on those timescales, and we would put the bar very high for postponement.</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Farage</strong> said the U-turn was a victory for his party, but also a “victory for freedom and democracy”.</p><p>He also said this should be a resignation matter for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/steve-reed">Steve Reed</a>, the housing secretary who took the decision to postpone the elections in the first place. He explained:</p><blockquote> <p>If a minister acts in a way that’s illegal, and tries to cancel people’s democratic right to vote whilst they’re still being charged their council tax, I personally think that really is a resignation matter.</p>
</blockquote><p>Farage also critcised the Tories for their record on this issue, pointing out that although they opposed cancellation of the elections nationally, in some areas Tory-led authorities requested a delay.</p><blockquote> <p>How can you stand up in the House of Commons, senior shadow minister after shadow minister, and say on behalf of the Conservatives it’s wrong that the elections should be cancelled, and yet five of your council areas – in some cases for the second year in a row – want to cancel those elections. Frankly, on this issue, the Conservatives are all over the place and every bit as bad as Labour.</p>
</blockquote><p>Farage said the Lib Dems had also called for a delay in Cheltenham, where they lead the council, even though Ed Davey opposed the government’s move at a national level.</p><figure><div><img alt="Nigel Farage being interviewed by broadcasters" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f190166d486cca9a6dc27e021522f132545dc684/0_0_1492_818/master/1492.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Nigel Farage being interviewed by broadcasters</span> Photograph: Press Association</figcaption></figure></article><article><header></header><p>Here are three commentators on the government’s decision to go ahead with local elections in 30 areas that only last month it said it was posptoning.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/LukeTryl/status/2023420626590204249">From</a> <strong>Luke Tryl</strong>, the More in Common pollster</p><blockquote> <p>Probably inevitable. But ends up with worst of all worlds from public opinion perspective. Another u-turn which makes govt look chaotic/weaker but still looks like as people said about winter fuel ‘Govt tried to get away with it and failed’</p>
</blockquote><p><a href="https://x.com/BNHWalker/status/2023417561443152127">From</a> the New Statemsman’s <strong>Ben Walker</strong></p><blockquote> <p>Government caves in on cancelled elections for soon to be abolished local authorities. What a shit show.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote> <p>Parties now need to scramble to field a few hundred more candidates.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote> <p>I wouldn’t try to ascertain how aware the voters were that their locales weren’t set to have elections but I wouldn’t be surprised if the swings away from Labour in these parts won’t be bigger.</p>

Richard Wright, the councillor who chairs the <strong>District Councils’ Network</strong>, has put out a statement on behalf of the DCN. He says people in local government will be “bewilderered” by what’s going on, and he says it implies the government has not got a good grasp on the “huge legal complexity” of reorganisation.</p><p>He says:</p><blockquote> <p>Council officers, councillors and local electorates will be bewildered by the unrelenting changes to the electoral timetable.</p> <p>Councils were assured by the government that elections could be legally cancelled but now it seems ministers have come to the opposite conclusion. It’s the government, not councils that have acted in good faith, which should bear responsibility for this mess which impacts on people’s faith in our cherished local democracy.</p> <p>The councils affected face an unnecessary race against time to ensure elections proceed smoothly and fairly, with polling stations booked and electoral staff available.</p> <p>If election cancellations were deemed necessary to free up capacity for local government reorganisation to succeed, councils will now be asking where this leaves the reorganisation timetable.</p> <p>We need to have faith in the government’s decision-making as we work on the biggest shake-up of councils in 50 years – but the government is doing little assure us that it has a strong grasp of the huge legal complexity involved.</p>

She says:</p><blockquote> <p>This is a zombie government. U-turn after U-turn after U-turn.</p> <p>No plan or programme to deliver anything. Even the simple stuff that should be business as usual gets messed up.</p>

Labour are terrified of Reform and we are the only party willing to stand up to Farage and beat him, as we do week after week in council byelections.</p> <p>We cannot allow the government to cancel elections on a whim ever again. That is why the Liberal Democrats have brought forward an amendment to change the law, stripping the government of this power and ensuring that the public’s voice is protected by statute, not left to the whims of ministers. Starmer should back these plans immediately.</p>

</blockquote><p>Reed justified his original decision to cancel some elections on the grounds that those councils were all saying holding elections would make reorganisation more difficult.</p></article><article><header></header><p>The <strong>Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government</strong> has issued this statement about the decision not to postpone local elections in 30 areas. A spokesperson said:</p><blockquote> <p>Following legal advice, the government has withdrawn its original decision to postpone 30 local elections in May.</p> <p>Providing certainty to councils about their local elections is now the most crucial thing and all local elections will now go ahead in May 2026.</p>
</blockquote><p>Whether or not the elections were being cancelled or just postponed is arguable. Future elections were always going to go ahead in these areas, when council reorganisation (the replacement of a two-tier council structure with unitary councils) was complete. So in that sense the elections were just being postponed. But by that point the old councils will no longer be in existence, so elections to those bodies were going to be cancelled.</p></article><article><header><h2>Government abandons plans to postpone local elections in 30 council areas in May</h2></header><p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the Reform UK leader, has just posted<a href="https://x.com/Nigel_Farage/status/2023404670669205866"> on social media</a> the letter sent out by the government confirming it has dropped its plans to delay elections in 30 council areas.</p><figure><div><img alt="Letter from government" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdde974aba70d6f6e9e6d9fb5a7345273f9ecdcc/0_0_1552_1640/master/1552.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Letter from government</span> Photograph: Nigel Farage</figcaption></figure><p>Farage says:</p><blockquote> <p>We took this Labour government to court and won.</p> <p>In collusion with the Tories, Keir <strong>Starmer</strong> tried to stop 4.6 million people voting on May 7th.</p> <p>Only Reform UK fights for democracy</p>

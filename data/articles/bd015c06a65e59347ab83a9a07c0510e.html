    <div><div><p>World Liberty Financial Token (WLFI), a DeFi governance token affiliated with the Trump family, may have signaled a major market breakdown hours before Bitcoin moved, according to a new analysis by data provider Amberdata.</p><p>The <a href="https://go.amberdata.io/coincidence-or-signal-did-wlfi-telegraph-cryptos-6.93b-meltdown-amberdata?utm_campaign=30302500-2025-Q4-WLFI-Telegraph-Report&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8DL_43VERqg5QDpEvcCkq5d6EyZ7ALBIygfgPcrRxLOIikFuxStdb0hhbmrnZrOfSP1U3OTDTTbyCGuSxVJaPBYPyOJrqBhgAEIINbua2g2Z6JEJw&amp;_hsmi=391424505&amp;utm_content=391424505&amp;utm_source=hs_automation" target="_blank">report</a> examines trading activity on Oct. 10, 2025, when roughly $6.93 billion in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/19b-crypto-market-crash-leverage-china-tariffs">leveraged crypto positions were liquidated</a> in under an hour. Bitcoin (BTC) fell about 15% and Ether (ETH) dropped roughly 20%, while smaller tokens lost as much as 70%. </p><p>Amberdata found that WLFI began a sharp decline more than five hours before the broader market downturn. At the time, Bitcoin was still trading near $121,000 and showed little immediate stress.</p><p>“A five-hour lead time is hard to dismiss as coincidence,” Mike Marshall, who authored the report, told Cointelegraph. “That duration is what separates a genuinely actionable warning from a statistical artefact,” he added. </p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/senators-urge-cfius-probe-uae-stake-trump-linked-wlfi"><em><strong>Senators ask Bessent to probe $500M UAE stake in Trump-linked&nbsp;WLFI</strong></em></a></p><h2>WLFI anomalies before the selloff</h2><p>Researchers analyzed three unusual patterns, including a surge in trading activity, a sharp divergence from Bitcoin and extreme leverage, to determine whether WLFI signaled stress before the broader market selloff.</p><p>WLFI’s hourly volume jumped to roughly $474 million, about 21.7 times its normal level, within minutes of tariff-related political news. Meanwhile, funding rates on WLFI perpetual futures reached about 2.87% every eight hours, equivalent to an annualized borrowing cost near 131%.</p><figure> <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6162-7e8b-76e2-a74a-31129e3d223a.PNG"><figcaption><em>WLFI funding rating.

Instead, it argues the way crypto markets are structured can make certain assets matter more than their size suggests.</p><p>WLFI’s holder base is concentrated among politically connected participants, the report says, unlike Bitcoin’s widely distributed ownership. Marshall said the trading pattern appeared “instrument-specific,” meaning activity was focused on WLFI rather than across the broader crypto complex.</p><p>“If this were superior analysis (sophisticated participants reading the tariff headlines faster and drawing better conclusions) you’d expect to see that reflected more broadly,” he said. “What we actually saw was concentrated activity in WLFI first.”</p><p>The timing is notable. Trading volume accelerated roughly three minutes after public tariff news. Marshall said such speed suggests prepared execution rather than retail traders interpreting headlines in real time.</p><p>The link between WLFI and the broader market drop comes down to leverage. Many crypto trading platforms let traders use several assets as collateral for borrowed positions. When WLFI fell sharply, the value of that collateral dropped, forcing traders to sell liquid assets like Bitcoin and Ether to cover their positions. Those sales pushed prices lower and triggered further liquidations across the market.</p><figure> <img alt="" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6163-8a20-74ff-a526-83049f77f15e.PNG"><figcaption><em>WLFI crashed ahead of Bitcoin.

    <div><div> <p>An armed man drove into the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as another vehicle was exiting before being shot and killed early Sunday morning, according to a spokesman for the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/usa/" target="_self">US</a> Secret Service.</p> <p>The man, who was in his early 20s and from North Carolina, had a gas can and a shotgun, according to Anthony Guglielmi, the spokesman. He had been reported missing by his family a few days ago, and investigators believe he headed south and picked up the shotgun along the way.</p> <p>Guglielmi said a box for the weapon was discovered in the man's vehicle after the incident, which took place around 1:30am.</p> <p><span>Read more</span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260222-france-to-summon-us-ambassador-over-comments-on-slain-far-right-activist-foreign-minister-says" target="_self">France to summon US ambassador over comments on slain far-right activist, foreign minister says</a></p> <p>The man killed was identified by investigators as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation.</p> <p>Trump has faced threats to his life before, including two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign. Although the president often spends weekends at his resort, he and first lady Melania Trump were at the White House when the breach at Mar-a-Lago occurred.&nbsp;</p> <p>After entering near the north gate of the property, the man was confronted by two Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.&nbsp;</p> <p>“He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with them. At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” Bradshaw said at a brief press conference. The two agents and the deputy “fired their weapons to neutralize the threat”.</p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eb0b65d0-1002-11f1-b6de-005056bf30b7/w:980/Capture-x.png" alt="Post on X from Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi"> <figcaption> <span>Post on X from Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.</span> <span> X</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>The FBI asked residents who live near Mar-a-Lago to check any security cameras they may have for footage that could help investigators.</p> <p>Investigators are working to compile a psychological profile and a motive is still under investigation. Asked whether the individual was known to law enforcement, Bradshaw said “not right now”.</p> <h2>Mounting political violence</h2> <p>The incident comes as the United States has been rocked by spasms of political violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>The incursion at Mar-a-Lago took place a few miles from Trump's West Palm Beach club where a man tried to assassinate him while he played golf during the 2024 campaign.</p> <p>A Secret Service agent spotted that man, Ryan Routh, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery before Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire and caused Routh to drop his weapon.</p> <p>Routh was found guilty last year and sentenced this month to life in prison.</p> <p>Trump also survived an assassination attempt at a Butler, Pennsylvania campaign rally. That gunman fired eight shots before being killed by a Secret Service counter sniper.</p> <p>The White House referred all questions to the Secret Service and FBI.</p> <p>There have been other recent incidents of political violence as well.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the last year, there was the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk; the assassination of the Democratic leader in the Minnesota state House and her husband and the shooting of another lawmaker and his wife; and an arson attack at the official residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.&nbsp;</p> <p>Five days ago, a Georgia man armed with a shotgun was arrested as he sprinted towards the west side of the US Capitol.</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AP)</em></p> </div></div>

  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <figure> <img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/02/Rolling-Square-AirCard.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600" alt=""> </figure> <p>At CES 2026, Rolling Square introduced new versions of two unique Find My accessories they offer: <a href="https://amzn.to/3Of69u3">AirCard Pro</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZBocwZ">AirNotch Pro</a>. Both of these now support both Apple’s Find My and Android’s Find Hub networks, and they’re better than ever – while coming in at lower price points.</p> <p>Apple debuted the original <a href="https://amzn.to/4rSzaKK">AirTag</a> nearly five years ago, and it introduced the <a href="https://amzn.to/4rSzaKK">second generation version </a>just last month.</p> <p>While <a href="https://amzn.to/4rSzaKK">AirTag 2 </a>did get a lot better with better precision finding and louder speakers, nothing fundamental changed about the product. The same form factor remained.</p> <p>These two accessories from Rolling Square help solve two gaps that AirTag leaves in the market. For one, you can’t easily attach an <a href="https://amzn.to/4rSzaKK">AirTag</a> to your keys without buying an accessory, and second – you can’t really put an <a href="https://amzn.to/4rSzaKK">AirTag</a> in your wallet without it being rather bulky. </p> <p>Plus, they can work with both the Android and Apple ecosystems, just in case you’re someone who ends up switching between devices – or if you’d like to gift it to someone without knowing what phone they have.</p> <h2>AirCard Pro Dual</h2> <p>You might remember the original AirCard from<a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/16/hands-on-aircard-puts-apples-find-my-tech-into-an-nfc-enabled-digital-business-card/"> a few years ago</a>. It launched as a Kickstarter, and unlike many Kickstarters – it actually made it to market. It took a while, but the AirCard came to fruition.</p> <p>The original AirCard did have one major flaw though: the battery wasn’t replaceable, and there was no way to charge it. It did last up to 30 months of usage, but after that, you’d be out of luck.</p> <p>Now, <a href="https://amzn.to/3Of69u3">AirCard Pro Dual </a>supports wireless charging. That way, you don’t have to worry about buying a new one when the battery dies.</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3Of69u3">AirCard Pro Dual </a>is rather thin, at just 2.2mm. That’s around two credit cards, so fitting it into a wallet isn’t a challenge at all.</p> <p>It also has a built in digital ID feature, allowing you to add your contact information to the QR code, that way you can easily pull the card out of your wallet and have others scan it. This is slightly less useful when features like NameDrop exist on iPhone, but it plays nicely into the cross-platform compatibility. </p> <p>Digital ID also serves a second purpose. When you put the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Of69u3">AirCard Pro Dual</a> into lost mode, it’ll only show relevant information to help someone get in contact with you.</p> <p>You can pick an <a href="https://amzn.to/3Of69u3">AirCard Pro Dua</a>l up on <a href="https://amzn.to/3Of69u3">Amazon for $39.99</a>.</p> <figure><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/02/IMG_1325.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt=""></figure> <h2>AirNotch</h2> <p>Next up, <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZBocwZ">AirNotch Pro Dua</a>l. In my opinion, it’s the ultimate way of tracking your keys using Find My.</p> <p>There’s one important caveat to any third party Find My accessory, and that’s the fact that you won’t have support for Precision Finding. However, <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZBocwZ">AirNotch Pro Dual</a> includes three features that make up for that: a much louder speaker than AirTag, glow in the dark strips, and much longer battery life (20 months).</p> <p>Glow in the dark strips are a rather useful feature, especially if you lose your keys in a dark and cluttered environment (like perhaps, under your bed) and a speaker won’t immediately help you find it.</p> <p>On top of that, it offers IP68 water resistance in case you happen to lose your keys in deeper waters. It uses dual CR2032 batteries, so you don’t have to worry about replacing the whole thing when it runs out of battery life. It also comes with the keyring in the box, no additional purchase necessary.</p> <p><a href="https://amzn.to/3ZBocwZ">AirNotch Pro Dual</a> is available on<a href="https://amzn.to/3ZBocwZ"> Amazon for $39.99</a>, coming in 20% cheaper than the previous version that only supported Apple Find My individually.</p> <figure><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/02/IMG_1329.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt=""></figure> <h2>Wrap up</h2> <p>Overall, it’s great to see more and more accessories joining the Find My network, especially these tailor made ones that help solve problems that <a href="https://amzn.to/4rSzaKK">AirTag</a> isn’t best suited for. It’s also great to see dual network support, which’ll inevitably make them less prone to becoming e-waste when enough time passes.</p> <p>You can buy either product on Amazon if you’re interested:</p> <ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Of69u3">AirCard Pro Dual – $39.99 on Amazon</a></li> <li><a href="https://amzn.to/3ZBocwZ">AirNotch Pro Dual – $39.99 on Amazon</a></li>

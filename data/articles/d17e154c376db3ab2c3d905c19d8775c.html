    <div><div> <p>Yoon abruptly declared martial law in a televised address in December 2024, saying drastic measures were needed to root out "anti-state forces".</p><p>The 65-year-old hardline conservative was later impeached, arrested and charged with a litany of crimes ranging from insurrection to obstruction of justice.</p><p>Prosecutors have sought the harshest penalty on the insurrection charges, urging the Seoul Central District Court to put Yoon on death row during hearings in January.</p><p>South Korea has an unofficial moratorium on capital punishment -- the last prisoners were executed in 1997 -- with a death sentence effectively banishing Yoon to life behind bars.</p><p>Long seen as a shining light of stable democracy in Asia, Yoon's failed bid to seize power stirred unpleasant memories of the military coups that jolted the nation between 1960 and 1980. </p><p>Millions of South Koreans are expected to come to a standstill when the court delivers its verdict in a live broadcast at 3pm (0600 GMT). </p><p>Yoon has been held in solitary confinement while fighting multiple criminal trials.</p><p>He has consistently denied wrongdoing, arguing he acted to "safeguard freedom" and restore constitutional order against what he called an opposition-led "legislative dictatorship". </p><p>Prosecutors accused him of leading an "insurrection" driven by a "lust for power aimed at dictatorship and long-term rule". </p><h2>Life, or death row</h2><p>Under South Korean law, only two sentences are fit for insurrection: life imprisonment or death. </p> <div> <figure> <img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b783fc42-0d30-11f1-b92d-005056a90284/w:980/f9fcf08062054c59d4166737f4dd03912a5315e6.jpg" alt="Supporters of South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol in front of the Seoul Central District Court during a hearing in January."> <figcaption> <span>Supporters of South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol in front of the Seoul Central District Court during a hearing in January.</span> <span> Jung Yeon-je / AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div><p>A legal observer said the court would most likely sentence Yoon to life in prison. </p><p>"In rare occasions, a judge could deliver what's legally known as a 'discretionary mitigation', handing down a sentence lighter than the minimum penalty set by law if they believe it is warranted," attorney Yoo Jung-hoon told AFP. </p><p>"But Yoon has neither pleaded guilty nor expressed remorse, so it will be hard for the panel of judges to give him anything lighter than a life term." </p><p>He has already been sentenced to five years in prison on lesser charges, while a host of senior officials also face hefty prison terms.</p><p>Yoon broke into late-night TV on December 3, 2024, to deliver a shock address to the nation. </p><p>Pointing to vague threats of North Korean influence and dangerous "anti-state forces", he declared the suspension of civilian government and the start of military rule. </p><p>Martial law was lifted six hours later after lawmakers raced to the assembly building to hold an emergency vote.</p><p>Staffers barricaded the doors with office furniture to keep armed troops at bay.</p><p>The declaration triggered flash protests, sent the stock market into panic and caught key military allies such as the United States off guard. </p><p>Yoon's wife Kim Keon Hee was sentenced to 20 months' jail earlier in January on unrelated charges stemming from bribes she took while first lady.</p> </div></div>

His son and heir, King Felipe, endorsed the move which has kept him out of the public eye, with the exception of occasional visits he has made to Spain for sailing regattas and other social events.</p></div><div><p>The PP has previously expressed a similar opinion about the former monarch. However, this appeal has been particularly bold and its timing has reopened the debate about Juan Carlos's future.</p></div><div><p>The socialist-led government, which has been critical of Juan Carlos while supporting the monarchy as an institution, sought to keep its distance from the issue.</p></div><div><p>"The decision of the king emeritus depends on him, it's up to him and the Royal Household, it's not up to the government or the opposition," said the Justice Minister, Félix Bolaños.</p></div><div><p>However, while many, mainly on the political right, support the idea of his ending his self-exile, it would not be straightforward.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/709f/live/a0f197c0-13d7-11f1-9120-a910fc22c6ac.jpg.webp" alt="Reuters Spain's King Felipe and his mother, Queen Sofía, leaving the funeral of Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark in Athens, Greece in January 2026.

"'You can exclude me on a personal and financial level, but you cannot reject the institutional inheritance in which you have grown up.'"</p></div><div><p>His return would present logistical challenges, such as where he would live, his financial arrangements and his relationship with Queen Sofía, to whom he is still married but who has remained in Spain.</p></div><div><p>"For him to return he would need to want to return in the only way possible, which is accepting the rules that his son sets him: to behave in a transparent and exemplary way," said Ana Romero, an author who has written extensively about Spain's monarchy.</p></div><div><p>Juan Carlos's homecoming, she said, would hinge on him putting "in order his marriage and his financial affairs".</p></div><div><p>The Royal Household said the decision to return was his alone. However, it also specified that, in order to safeguard the "image and reputation" of both the former king and the monarchy, "Juan Carlos should have his tax domicile in Spain".</p></div></article></div></div>

Despite extensive searches, there were no leads.</p></div><div><p>A suspect was charged with her abduction and murder in 2017, but his trial collapsed after his teenage confession was ruled inadmissible. He denies any wrongdoing and prosecutors dropped the case.</p></div><div><p>"It's taken way too many years but finally we're really happy that they see our fight for some justice for Cheryl," Ricki Nash, Cheryl's older brother, told the BBC.</p></div><div><p>Nash said the family had written to NSW Police to request it reopen an investigation, taking into account new evidence that had come to light since 2019.</p></div><div><p>"We are not asking for anything extraordinary," he said. "When transparency leads the process, evil can no longer hide behind process failures or bureaucratic division."</p></div><div><p>The British toddler and her family had only recently migrated to Australia from Bristol as so-called Ten Pound Poms before she vanished.</p></div><div><p>On the day Cheryl disappeared, Nash had been put in charge of his younger siblings as the family got ready to leave the beach. He was told to go to the bathroom block and Cheryl ran giggling into the ladies' changing rooms, refusing to come out.</p></div><div><p>Too embarrassed to enter himself, Nash went back to the beach to tell his mother to help. When they returned 90 seconds later, the toddler was gone.</p></div><div><p>Cheryl's family has been pushing for a fresh investigation ever since the trial collapsed seven years ago. They argue that lots of missteps were made by NSW authorities in their search for Cheryl.</p></div><div><p>Last October, Jeremy Buckingham, a member of the NSW Legislative Council, the state's upper house, used parliamentary privilege to name the suspect. He had been known only as Mercury, as his real name is legally protected because he was a minor at the time of the alleged crime.</p></div><div><p>In May, there will also be a NSW parliamentary inquiry looking into cases of unsolved murders and long-term missing people – with Grimmer's case forming part of the inquiry.</p></div></article></div></div>

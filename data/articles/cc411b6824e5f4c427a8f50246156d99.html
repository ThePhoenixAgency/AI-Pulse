<p>New orders of the Mac Studio are currently seeing unusually long delays, with shipping estimates stretching out to April for some models. Here are the details.</p>



<h2>Apple Store shows delays for many Mac Studio configurations</h2>



<p>Rumors keep indicating that Apple has new products launching soon, including <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/05/six-apple-products-will-launch-early-this-year-heres-whats-coming/">several new MacBooks</a> and potentially an M5 Mac Studio.</p>



<p><em>Bloomberg</em> has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/25/apple-mac-lineup-2026-plans-macbook-pro-overhaul-new-m6-chips/">reported</a> that a new Mac Studio will launch in the first half of this year. A release alongside Apple’s new Studio Display seems likely, which could happen in the next month or so.</p>



<p>Adding fuel to the speculation, Apple Store inventory for the current Mac Studio appears to be dwindling.</p>

<p>Depending on the exact model you’re looking for, waits are stretching out through early April at the latest—particularly if you want the maximum 512GB of RAM.</p>



<p>Upon checking locations in several parts of the country, I saw March 27-April 3 estimates for both M4 Max and M3 Ultra models of Mac Studio when the highest RAM option was selected.</p>



<p>Models with specs that aren’t quite as top-tier are still seeing delays of about a month in many cases. But entry options remain readily available.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether the current shortages are due to an imminent refresh, or because of current industry-wide memory shortages, or perhaps consumer trends like the increasingly popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenClaw">OpenClaw/Clawdbot/Moltbot</a>.</p>



<p>But if you’re in the market for a Mac Studio, it might take a while to get one.</p>

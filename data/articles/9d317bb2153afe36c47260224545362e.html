  <h1>‘Get the files out’: Hillary Clinton slams Trump's Epstein cover-up</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <p>Former US secretary of state <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/hillary-clinton/" target="_self">Hillary Clinton</a> has accused President <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/donald-trump/" target="_self">Donald Trump</a> of orchestrating a "cover-up" over files related to sex offender <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/jeffrey-epstein/" target="_self">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, according to an interview with the BBC published Monday.</p> <p>"Get the files out. They are slow-walking it," Clinton, who is due to testify before a Congressional committee on the issue, told the British broadcaster in an interview in Berlin.</p> <p>The Justice Department last month released the latest cache of so-called Epstein files&nbsp;– more than three million documents, photos and videos related to its investigation into sex criminal Epstein, who died from what was determined to be suicide while in custody in 2019.</p> <p>Clinton's husband, former president <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/bill-clinton/" target="_self">Bill Clinton</a>, features regularly in the files, but no evidence has come to light implicating either Clinton in criminal activity.</p> <p>The couple has been ordered to give closed-door depositions before the House Oversight Committee, which is probing the deceased financier's connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled.</p> <p>"We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public," Hillary Clinton told the BBC.&nbsp;</p> <p>"I just want it to be fair," she said. "I want everybody treated the same way."&nbsp;</p> <p>The former secretary of state said she and her husband "have nothing to hide. We have called for the full release of these files repeatedly."</p> <p>The Department of Justice has said it has no more files to release, though lawmakers have criticised it for not publishing internal government memos, notes and emails on Epstein.</p> <p>Clinton said the Republicans probing her are trying to deflect attention away from Trump, whose name is also mentioned in the files many times.</p> <p>"Look at this shiny object. We're going to have the Clintons, even Hillary Clinton, who never met the guy," she said.</p> <p>Trump denies any wrongdoing. Mere mention in the files is not proof of having committed a crime.</p> <p>Former president Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein's plane in the early 2000s for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited Epstein's private island.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, who ran against Trump for president in 2016, has said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.</p> <p>In the interview with the BBC, she said she had met <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/ghislaine-maxwell-1/" target="_self">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, an Epstein associate who was convicted of conspiring with him to sexually abuse minors, "on a few occasions".</p> <p>Responding to Clinton's comment that the congressional testimony was a bid to create a distraction, Trump denied it, telling reporters Monday evening he had been "totally exonerated".</p> <p>Hillary Clinton will appear for her deposition on February 26, while Bill Clinton will appear on February 27.</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with AFP)</em></p> </div></div>

                    <p>An <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-17e">iPhone 17e</a> with A19 and MagSafe is expected to launch imminently, and the rumored budget-friendly MacBook could arrive soon after. Here's what Apple's 2026 product lineup looks like.
</p><p>Ever since Apple launched <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-silicon">Apple Silicon</a>, rumors have suggested Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/08/cheaper-macbook-with-iphone-chip-still-expected-in-early-2026">could use</a> the highly efficient chipsets to revive the MacBook. That product, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/08/iphone-17e-is-coming-soon-with-a19-and-a-599-price-tag">along with</a> the iPhone 17e, could broaden Apple's reach in the budget-friendly market.
</p><p>The latest hints at Apple's development pipeline <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk">comes from</a> the <em>Power On</em> newsletter. While this week's provides a brief overview and hints at colorful MacBooks, last week's gave a wider view of the year's launches.
</p><p>The new MacBook is expected to be manufactured with a cheaper, more efficient process while still keeping the frame made from the premium-feeling aluminum. Various colors are being tested, though not all will be available at launch, like yellow, green, blue, pink, silver, and gray.
</p><p>It is expected to have a 13-inch display and be powered by an "iPhone-class chip." While it is <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/11/21/where-the-rumored-budget-macbook-fits-in-apples-laptop-lineup">expected to compete</a> with Chromebooks and inexpensive Windows laptops, its price will still be well above the education market's entry $300-ish price point.
</p><p>The MacBook could arrive at the current price of that M1 <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/macbook-air">MacBook Air</a> still being offered at Walmart —  $649. At least, it could come close.
</p><p>The iPhone 17e could be a lot like the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-16e">iPhone 16e</a>, but it'll get some <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/10/07/iphone-17e-rumors-dynamic-island-a19-chip-and-more">much-needed internal changes</a> —  namely the addition of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/magsafe">MagSafe</a>. The A19 chip will keep it modern, and it'll also gain the in-house N-series networking chip and an updated C-series modem.
</p><p>iPhone 17e could launch via press release <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/06/if-this-rumor-is-true-the-iphone-17e-will-launch-in-february">before the end of February</a>, though early March is also rumored. It will remain at the $599 price point.
</p><p>If Apple wants to make more of a splash, these <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-intelligence">Apple Intelligence</a>-ready products could be announced via a March event. It would be a good time to detail <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/25/new-siri-expected-to-finally-debut-in-ios-264-beta-shortly">what's expected</a> in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios-26">iOS 26.4</a> and show off the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ipad">iPad</a> with A19 as well.
</p><p>Of course, rumors suggest that Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/11/siri-testing-isnt-going-well-new-features-probably-wont-ship-in-ios-264">may be shifting</a> some of its Apple Intelligence features to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/13/siri-apple-intelligence-upgrades-still-coming-in-2026-in-spite-of-rumors">later in the year</a>. This is being classified as a delay by reports, though externally, there's no way to judge exactly what such a move might mean for consumers until the features actually launch.
</p><h2>Apple's busy 2026 rollout</h2><p>The M5 upgrades will continue as well alongside an <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/05/fresh-iphone-17e-ipad-leak-points-to-incremental-upgrades">A18 update</a> to the entry-level iPad, giving it access to Apple Intelligence. <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/04/questionable-leak-macbook-pro-with-m5-pro-and-m5-max-coming-in-march-not-february">Expect to see</a> the M5 Pro and M5 Max in the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/macbook-pro">MacBook Pro</a>, an update to the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/mac-mini">Mac mini</a>, Mac Studio, MacBook Air, and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/imac">iMac</a>.
</p><div><p><a href="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66714-139894-Mac-Studio-1-xl.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/66714-139894-Mac-Studio-1-xl.jpg" alt="A Mac Studio under the Studio Display on a desk where a blue light is shining on the left side by an orange HomePod mini" /></a></p><p><span>A Mac Studio and new Studio Display could arrive in the first half of 2026</span></p></div><p>A refreshed <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/studio-display">Studio Display</a> with ProMotion is <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/08/m5-max-mac-studio-new-studio-display-could-finally-arrive-in-the-spring">also expected</a> in 2026, though the exact timeline remains unknown.
</p><p>The <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ipad-air">iPad Air</a> should <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/12/10/leak-shows-a19-ipad-m4-ipad-air-unsurprisingly-will-arrive-in-early-2026">be upgraded</a> with an M4 processor to keep it one chipset behind the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ipad-pro">iPad Pro</a> lineup. Though little else should change about the product.
</p><p>Then there's the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ipad-mini">iPad mini</a>, which <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/11/26/ipad-mini-with-oled-expected-to-arrive-by-the-end-of-2026">could gain</a> an OLED display and slight design change to help increase its water resistance. While it won't be waterproof, it should at least be closer to an <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone">iPhone's</a> water resistance to allow for accidental, and brief, submersion or splashes.
</p><p>However, the timeline around these products is less certain. We're sure to see the MacBook Pro updates and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/mac-studio">Mac Studio</a> in the first half of the year —  everything else is anyone's guess.
</p><p>If <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/11/16/expect-big-changes-in-iphone-release-timing-in-2026-and-2027">rumors about</a> Apple's iPhone lineup hold true, an <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-fold">iPhone Fold</a> will release in the fall alongside the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-18">iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max</a>. The base models will shift to the spring of 2027.</p>

Altcoins such as HYPE, ZEC and XMR are down by more than 3%.</p><div><p><span>STORY CONTINUES BELOW</span></p></div><p>Ether <span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum"><span><span><span>ETH</span><span></span><span>$1,995.82</span></span></span></a></span> is one of Monday's outliers, rising by 0.43% since midnight as it claws its way back to $2,000 after a grueling weekend selloff was spurred by selling pressure from trader Garrett Jin.</p><p>Onchain <a href="https://x.com/crypto_condom/status/2023064517760938043/photo/1" target="_blank">data</a> shows a wallet attributed to Jin deposited more than $540 million worth of ether to Binance over the weekend, leading to a disproportionate rise in sell volume compared with other exchanges.</p><p>That pressure translated into oversold conditions that ultimately set the scene for Monday's recovery.</p><p>Gold is changing hands at $5,000 on Monday, down from its Jan. 29 peak of $5,600 but outperforming silver and crypto, which are down by 36% and 21% respectively over the same period.</p><p>U.S. markets are closed on Monday due to a public holiday.</p><h3>Derivatives positioning</h3><ul><li>The crypto futures market continues to see capital outflows, with notional open interest (OI), or the dollar value of total open or active contracts, dropping to $98 billion. </li><li>De-risking is seen across the board, with OI falling 1% and 2.7% in bitcoin and ether futures, respectively, over 24 hours. XRP, DOGE, SUI and ADA saw declines of 6% or more. </li><li>OI in futures tied to gold token XAUT rose 8% as traders continued to deploy capital in traditional assets. </li><li>BTC and ETH's 30-day implied volatility has reversed the massive pop from annualized 50% to nearly 100% earlier this month, when prices crashed. The reversal indicates a massive pricing out of volatility risks, supporting the case for price recovery. </li><li>The spread between ether and bitcoin implied volatility indexes is beginning to widen, indicating expectations for bigger swings in ether. </li><li>Funding rates for several alternative tokens, such as XRP, TRX, DOGE and SOL, remain negative, indicating a trader preference for bearish, short positions. If the market remains resilient, these bears may feel compelled to square off their bets, potentially leading to a "short squeeze" higher. </li><li>SOL futures on CME show an annualized premium near zero, a sign of buy-side pressure fading fast. BTC and ETH futures are trading with slight premiums.</li><li>On Deribit, someone paid $3 million in premium for the $75,000 strike bitcoin call option. The massive flow likely represents a bullish bet on the market. </li><li>Still, put options tied to BTC and ETH remain pricier than calls across all time frames, a sign of lingering downside concerns. </li></ul><h3>Token talk</h3><ul><li>The altcoin market experienced a familiar, low-liquidity drift lower on Sunday before a slight recovery on Monday morning.</li><li>Popular memecoin <span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/dogecoin"><span><span><span>DOGE</span><span></span><span>$0.1024</span></span></span></a></span> is down by more than 10% in the past 24 hours but has steadied since midnight UTC, while XRP has risen by 1% by midnight despite losing 8% of its value since Sunday morning.</li><li>Layer zero (ZRO) continues to lose momentum after its early February rally, falling by more than 34% over the past five days including a 10% drawdown in the past 24 hours.

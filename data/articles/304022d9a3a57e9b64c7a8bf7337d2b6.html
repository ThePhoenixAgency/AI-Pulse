  <h1>Apple TV Expands MLS and F1 Access to Bars Through EverPass Deal</h1>

<p>Apple TV has signed a distribution deal with EverPass Media to bring its live sports package into bars, restaurants, and casinos across the United States. The agreement arrives as Apple begins its first full season holding Formula 1 rights in the U.S. and shifts Major League Soccer into its main Apple TV subscription. The move aims to put more live matches and races on big screens in public venues.</p>

<p>The partnership gives thousands of commercial locations access to Apple’s live sports portfolio through the existing EverPass Core package. That lineup includes MLS matches, MLB Friday Night Baseball, and now F1 coverage. Establishments already using EverPass will not pay extra to add Apple TV’s sports feed.</p>

<p>According to <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2026/02/13/apple-tv-expands-bar-access-to-mls-f1-via-everpass/">Sports Business Journal</a></em>, EverPass already supplies sports streaming packages such as ESPN+, NFL Sunday Ticket, and Peacock to commercial venues nationwide. With Apple now folded into that system, bars and restaurants can add MLS and F1 alongside other major sports offerings without separate deals.</p>

<h2>MLS Moves Fully Into Apple TV</h2>

<p>Apple and MLS expect higher viewership after shutting down the standalone MLS Season Pass and placing all league matches inside the core Apple TV service. League and network executives believe wider commercial access will further increase exposure.</p>

<p>Apple TV Head of Production for Live Sports Royce Dickerson said during a media briefing, “I can’t understate how big a deal that is to have that deal done with EverPass and be in all of those commercial establishments.”</p>

<h2>Broadcasters Return to Stadiums in 2026</h2>

<p>MLS will also send broadcast teams on-site for every match in 2026. Last season, some games used remote commentary. MLS Executive Vice President of Media Seth Bacon said the league sees value in that change.</p>

<p>“We understand the value of having the announcers closer to the action for the match itself,” Bacon said. He added that on-site crews help capture content beyond the 90 minutes of play, which Apple and MLS can distribute across their channels.</p>

<p>The league will offset added production costs by ending the Spanish-language version of “MLS 360.” Bacon said viewership data showed more than 90 percent of audiences watched in English, which guided that decision.</p>

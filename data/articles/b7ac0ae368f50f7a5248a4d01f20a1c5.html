</p><p>Update: nominations are now closed, and voting is 
live! <a href="https://portswigger.net/polls/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-2025">Cast
 your vote here</a></p>

<p>Over the last year, security researchers have shared a huge amount of work with the community through blog posts, presentations, and whitepapers. This is great, but it also means genuinely reusable techniques can get buried, and even flashy findings eventually get eclipsed as everyone chases the next shiny logo.</p>
<p>Since 2006, the community has come together each year to turn that firehose into two useful resources:</p>
<ul><li>A lightly curated list of notable web security research from the last year</li><li>A focused top ten of the most valuable, must-read work</li></ul>
<p>If you want to dig through past nominees and winners or learn more about the project history, check out the full project archive. Otherwise, read on to find out how to make your nominations for 2025.</p>
<p>This year, we'll target the following timeline:</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<ul><li>Jan 6-13: Collect community nominations for the top research from 2025</li><li>Jan 14-21: Community votes on nominations to build a shortlist of the top 15</li><li>Jan 22: Launch panel vote on shortlist to select and order the 10 finalists</li><li>Feb 03: Publish top 10 web hacking techniques of 2025!</li></ul>
<h3>What should I nominate?</h3>
<p>The aim is to highlight research containing novel, practical techniques that can be re-applied to different systems. Individual vulnerabilities like log4shell are valuable at the time but typically age poorly, whereas underlying techniques such as JNDI Injection can be reapplied to great effect. Nominations can also be refinements to already-known attack classes, such as Exploiting <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe">XXE</a> with Local DTD Files. For further examples, you might find it useful to check out <a href="https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques" target="_blank">previous year's top 10s.</a></p>
<h3>Making a nomination</h3>
<p>To submit, simply provide a URL to the research, and an optional brief comment explaining what's novel about the work. Feel free to make as many nominations as you like, and nominate your own work if you think it's worthy!</p>

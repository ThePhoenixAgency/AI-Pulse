<li>On-chain indicators tracked by CryptoQuant show long-term holders hovering near breakeven, a level that historically precedes bear-market bottoms.</li>
<li>Traders are bracing for delayed January inflation data after a hot jobs report, with a higher-for-longer rate outlook threatening renewed downside.</li>
<li>Some argue panic selling may be exhausting itself, citing extreme fear readings and heavy accumulation near the $60,000 support zone.</li>
</ul></div><p><span>Bitcoin is flashing signals that have marked major turning points in past cycles, but not yet the kind that typically accompany a durable bottom.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Several on-chain indicators tracked by CryptoQuant suggest the market remains stuck between a mid-cycle correction and a deeper reset, even as investors debate whether the worst may already be priced in.</span></p><p><span>Long-Term Holder (LTH) capitulation, Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), and the percentage of supply in profit are all currently in no man's land—positioned between a mid-cycle correction and a total market reset.</span></p><p><span>"Historically, bear market bottoms have coincided with periods when LTHs experience 30% to 40% loss margins," CryptoQuant's Thursday </span><a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/research/698e05d063d8c427644251e9-12-February-2026-Patience-Bear-Market-Bottoms-Take-Time-to-Form" target="_blank"><span>report</span></a><span> noted.</span></p><p><span>Long-term holder profits have declined from 142% in October to breakeven levels, but analysts said this remains far from true capitulation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I broadly agree the market may not have confirmed a macro bottom yet," Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget, told </span><i><span>Decrypt</span></i><span>. "Liquidity remains tight, and risk assets still react to macro data. A final washout is possible, especially if equities weaken."</span></p><p><span>The MVRV Z-score, meanwhile, has yet to enter an oversold range between -0.4 and -0.7, where bottoms have historically formed. NUPL currently sits at around 0.1, though price bottoms typically occur when holders are experiencing roughly 20% in unrealized losses.</span></p><p><span>Traditional finance firms such as Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered have also taken a similar bearish stance, </span><i><span>Decrypt </span></i><span>previously </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/357910/myriad-moves-bitcoin-traders-expect-dump-55k" target="_blank"><span>reported</span></a><span>. They expect Bitcoin to slide between $50,000 and $ 58,000 in the coming days.</span></p><p><span>Following a hotter-than-expected </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/357789/bitcoin-slides-fed-rate-cut-doubts-strong-jobs-report" target="_blank"><span>jobs report</span></a><span>, traders are now awaiting fresh January inflation data on Friday, after its release was delayed by the partial government shutdown.</span></p><p><span>A surprise rise in headline </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/357818/bitcoin-crypto-this-weeks-inflation-data" target="_blank"><span>inflation</span></a><span> could reinforce a higher-for-longer regime, putting additional pressure on risk assets, including Bitcoin.</span></p><p><span>Bitcoin investors are navigating one of the most uncertain macro environments in years, with conflicting signals leaving the market searching for direction. Still, not all analysts are convinced.</span></p><p><span>"The Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index plunged to a reading of 11/100 on February 11, signaling acute panic and potential seller exhaustion," Sean McNulty, APAC derivatives trading lead at FalconX, told </span><i><span>Decrypt</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Unlike the 2022 crash, the downturn has been driven by macroeconomic shifts and a liquidity crunch rather than a systemic, industry-wide failure like the FTX collapse, he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"The absence of a catastrophic blow-up suggests the market may be experiencing a standard, albeit painful, institutional deleveraging rather than a terminal breakdown," he added</span></p><p><span>McNulty also pointed to recent price action, where Bitcoin briefly tested psychological support at $60,000 last week, sparking a rapid 19% rebound within 24 hours as social sentiment hit peak </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/357159/crypto-sentiment-sinks-lowest-level-3-5-years" target="_blank"><span>capitulation levels</span></a><span>, as evidence of a floor forming.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>That was supported by a record single-day inflow of 66,940 BTC into accumulation addresses, suggesting institutional whales are aggressively </span><a href="https://decrypt.co/357569/is-bitcoins-sell-off-finally-running-out-of-steam" target="_blank"><span>defending</span></a><span> the $60,000–$62,000 zone.</span></p><p><span>"With the MVRV Z-score dropping to 1.2, the data indicates that Bitcoin is already trading at deep value, leaving little room for a sustained breakdown below the $55,000 realized cost basis," McNulty added.</span></p><div><h3>Daily Debrief Newsletter</h3><p>Start every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.</p></div></div></div>

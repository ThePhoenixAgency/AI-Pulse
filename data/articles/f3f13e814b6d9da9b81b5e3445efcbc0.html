In the 48 minutes where its location data was public, the vessel appeared to be heading towards the Mediterranean Sea.</p></div><div><p>But the carrier has not yet been sighted crossing the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean and an aircraft which operates from it was tracked returning to the Atlantic on Thursday.</p></div><div><p>On Monday, BBC Verify identified another aircraft carrier - USS Abraham Lincoln - in satellite images taken on Saturday off the coast of Oman, about 700km (430 miles) from Iran.</p></div><div><p>The arrival of two of the 11 aircraft carriers operated by the US Navy adds to what we know about the military build-up in the Middle East over the past few weeks, where BBC Verify has tracked an increase of destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.</p></div><div><p>Both Gerald R Ford and Abraham Lincoln lead strike groups with several guided missile destroyer warships.

The carrier transmitted its location, visible on ship-tracking website MarineTraffic, until 13:18 and was sailing in the direction of the Mediterranean.</p></div><div><p>However, a transport aircraft attached to the carrier which landed in Spain on Wednesday was tracked at about 13:00 on Thursday heading towards the area where the aircraft carrier was spotted.</p></div><div><p>The appearance of Gerald R Ford comes after BBC Verify identified the Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea, around 240km (150 miles) off the coast of Oman, in publicly available images captured on Saturday by the European Sentinel-2 satellites.</p></div><div><p>The Abraham Lincoln had not been seen since it reportedly entered the region in January but it had been crossing the open sea where satellite coverage is limited. Military assets on land are more visible and frequently captured on satellite.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3bc6/live/c13d9f90-0dbc-11f1-b7e1-afb6d0884c18.png.webp" alt="Satellite image of USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea "></p></div></figure></div><div><p>BBC Verify has now tracked 12 US ships in the Middle East: the Abraham Lincoln, a nuclear-powered Nimitz-class carrier, which together with three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers forms a carrier strike group; plus two destroyers capable of carrying out long-range missile strikes and three specialist ships for combat near to the shore that are currently positioned at Bahrain naval station in the Gulf. Two other destroyers have been seen in the eastern Mediterranean near the Souda Bay US base, and one more in the Red Sea.</p></div><div><p>We have also been following the movements of large numbers of US aircraft to both European and Middle Eastern airbases, including:</p></div><div><ul><li>F-35 and F-22 fighter jets</li><li>KC-135 and KC-46 refuelling tankers used to support the long-range movement of other aircraft</li><li>E-3 Sentry command and surveillance aircraft designed to coordinate large-scale operations</li></ul></div><div><p></p><h2>How has Iran responded?</h2><p></p></div><div><p>In response to recent US military movements, Iran has carried out its own show of force.</p></div><div><p>On Monday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran. The exercise saw IRGC Commander‑in‑Chief Maj Gen Mohammad Pakpour inspecting naval vessels at a harbour before missiles are seen launching from a ship, the IRGC-linked Tasnim News Agency reported.</p></div><div><p>The Strait is considered one of the world's most important shipping routes and a vital oil transit choke point. Around a fifth of the world's oil and gas flows through the Strait, including from Kharg Island, Iran's main oil export terminal. Pakpour was seen flying over the island in a helicopter in the report showing Iran's latest military manoeuvres.</p></div><div><p>Footage broadcast by Iranian state TV on Thursday also showed planned naval drills in the Gulf of Oman with Russia, which involved a simulated ship rescue operation.</p></div><div><p>The Fars news agency - which is affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - said "operational units from both Iran's regular army's navy and the IRGC navy" took part.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/add2/live/4ee49d40-0b5f-11f1-9972-d3f265c101c6.png.webp" alt="USS Abraham Lincoln, Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier graphic showing speed 30+ knots 34.5pmh crew (ship &amp; air) 5,680, propulsion 2 nuclear reactors 4 shafts aircraft 90 range unlimited displacement 88,000 tonnes and comparison in size with Eiffel Tower "></p></div></figure></div><div><p></p><h2>How does it compare with Venezuela and Operation Midnight Hammer?</h2><p></p></div><div><p>Military intelligence expert Justin Crump told BBC Verify that the current US military preparations in the Middle East show "more depth and sustainability" than its manoeuvres ahead of the seizure of former Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in January, or the operation carrying out air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last June.</p></div><div><p>They all feature a carrier strike group and several destroyers operating independently. However, the <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo">US deployed its assets in Venezuela</a> and Iran last year under quite different circumstances.</p></div><div><p>The US deployed the Gerald R Ford to the Caribbean ahead of its strikes on Venezuela, one of eight warships we tracked in the region at the time, though it used fewer aircraft as it could easily send jets from surrounding US bases on America's mainland or from its base in Puerto Rico instead. </p></div><div><p>The US also deployed amphibious assault ships within the Caribbean, which can be used as launch platforms for helicopter operations as was seen with the capture of Maduro. But Venezuela's military is generally seen as less capable of defending itself or retaliating against the US.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260205-130046-240c8e457e-web-2.39.1-1/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/101a/live/4659d600-0b5e-11f1-b5e2-dd58fc65f0f6.jpg.webp" alt="Reuters The U.S. Navy's Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Frank E.

"><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>In February the US military released an image of the Lincoln carrier strike group in the Arabian Sea </figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>When the US struck Iran last year in Operation Midnight Hammer, which <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg9r4q99g4o">targeted Iran's nuclear facilities</a>, it was attacking a country with a much more powerful military than Venezuela. Iran's military is capable of hitting US bases across the Middle East.</p></div><div><p>The recent build-up in the region more closely resembles that seen during Operation Midnight Hammer. The US had two aircraft carrier strike groups in the region, five destroyers placed in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, and three combat ships in the Gulf. </p></div><div><p>It had also moved squadrons of fighter jets and refuelling aircraft from the US to Europe. But the B2 stealth bomber flights that were used to hit the Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites actually took off from US bases in Missouri.</p></div><div><p>Crump, chief executive of risk and intelligence company Sibylline, said the build-up of US warships and aircraft, as well as eight existing airbases in the region would allow it to conduct a "fairly intensive and sustained strike rate" of about 800 sorties a day, with the aim of rendering any Iranian responses "ineffective".</p></div><div><p>"What we are seeing isn't just strike preparation, but rather a broader deterrent deployment capable of being scaled up or down," he said. "This means it has more depth and sustainability than the force packages arranged for either Venezuela or Midnight Hammer last year. It's designed to sustain an engagement and counter all potential responses against US assets in the region and, of course, Israel."</p></div><div><p><i>Additional reporting by Barbara Metzler, Ghoncheh Habibiazad, Thomas Copeland, Yi Ma</i></p></div></article></div></div>

  <div class="content">
    <div><div><p>The US state of Nevada has sued Kalshi after the prediction market company lost its court challenge to stop the state’s regulator from taking action over its sports prediction markets.</p><p>The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Tuesday denied Kalshi’s bid to stop Nevada’s gaming regulator from taking action on its sports event contracts, removing a block on the regulator launching a civil suit against the company.</p><p>After the decision, the Nevada Gaming Control Board promptly <a href="https://www.gaming.nv.gov/siteassets/content/about/press-release/kalshi-complaint.pdf" target="_blank">filed</a> a civil enforcement action in state court against Kalshi, which it <a href="https://www.gaming.nv.gov/siteassets/content/about/press-release/ngcb-files-civil-enforcement-action-against-kalshi.pdf" target="_blank">said</a> sought to block the company “from offering unlicensed wagering in violation of Nevada law.”</p><p>Kalshi swiftly filed a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/72289181/1/state-of-nevada-ex-rel-nevada-gaming-control-board-v-kalshiex-llc/" target="_blank">motion</a> to have the suit heard in a federal court, repeating its long-held argument that it is “subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction” under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p><p>The appeals court order and subsequent lawsuit are a blow to Kalshi in its nearly year-long battle against Nevada to keep its sports contracts active in the state. The company and other prediction markets are facing multiple similar lawsuits from other states.</p><p>The company <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/kalshi-sues-nevada-new-jersey-gaming-regulators">sued the state last year in March</a> after receiving a cease-and-desist order to halt all sports-related markets within the state. In April, a federal court backed Kalshi’s bid to temporarily block Nevada from taking action amid court proceedings.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6f5e-51db-751a-ac6d-c19ef8a86d09.png"><figcaption><em>Source: </em><a href="https://x.com/WALLACHLEGAL/status/2023917054638653938" target="_blank"><em>Daniel Wallach</em></a>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Kalshi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><h2>Nevada says Kalshi is flouting state law</h2><p>In its latest lawsuit, the Nevada Gaming Control Board repeated its past claim that Kalshi’s sports event contracts meet the requirements to be licensed under state law, as they allow “users to wager on the outcomes of sporting events.”</p><p>Despite making wagers, sports betting and other gaming activities accessible in the State of Nevada, Kalshi is not licensed in Nevada and does not comply with Nevada gaming law, the regulator argued.</p><p>In its federal court motion, Kalshi argued that such a claim means the court “must adopt a narrow interpretation” of federal commodity exchange laws, which it asserts it is regulated under by the CFTC.</p><h2>CFTC chair asserts jurisdiction over prediction markets</h2><p>Earlier on Tuesday, CFTC chair Mike Selig said his agency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cftc-michael-selig-defending-prediction-markets">filed an amicus brief</a> backing Crypto.com in a similar lawsuit the crypto exchange had brought against Nevada.</p><p>Crypto.com had sued Nevada’s regulators in June after similarly receiving a cease-and-desist letter. It also appealed to the Ninth Circuit in November after losing a federal court motion to block the state from taking action.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-digital-chamber-launches-prediction-market-working-group"><em><strong>Crypto lobby forms working group seeking prediction market clarity</strong></em></a></p><p>The CFTC argued in its brief to the Ninth Circuit that “states cannot invade the CFTC’s exclusive jurisdiction over CFTC-regulated designated contract markets by re-characterizing swaps trading on DCMs as illegal gambling.”</p><p>Selig said that event contracts “are commodity derivatives and squarely within the CFTC’s regulatory remit,” and the agency would “defend its exclusive jurisdiction over commodity derivatives.”</p><p>The CFTC’s push comes after Trump Media and Technology Group said in October that it was looking to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-truth-social-prediction-markets-crypto-com">bring prediction markets</a> to its flagship social media platform, Truth Social, via a partnership with Crypto.com.</p><p>Donald Trump Jr., the US president’s son, has also been an <a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/donald-trump-jr-strategic-advisor" target="_blank">advisor</a> to Kalshi since January 2025. He has also served as an advisor to rival Polymarket after investing in the company in August.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>AI Eye: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/ironclaw-secure-private-sounds-cooler-openclaw-ai-eye/"><em><strong>IronClaw rivals OpenClaw, Olas launches bots for Polymarket</strong></em></a></p></div><p>Cointelegraph is committed to independent, transparent journalism.

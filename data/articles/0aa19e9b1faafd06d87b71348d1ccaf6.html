    <div><div><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Bitcoin remains under pressure, and the downside might accelerate if the $65,118 level is breached.</p></li><li><p>Several major altcoins are attempting a recovery, but the bears remain sellers on rallies.</p></li></ul><p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) bulls are attempting to hold the price above $67,000, but the bears have continued to exert pressure. A positive sign for the bulls is that select analysts believe BTC may be bottoming out.</p><p>Analyst Jelle said in a post on X that all but one of BTC’s major bottoms had formed between the 200-week simple moving average ($58,371) and the 200-week exponential moving average ($68,065). BTC trading near the 200-week EMA suggests that the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/traders-pinpoint-three-price-targets-for-bitcoin-if-dollar70k-holds-as-resistance">bottom formation process may have begun</a>.</p><p>Similarly, Matrixport said in a post on X that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-chart-pattern-whale-activity-warn-of-another-20-price-drop">BTC may be making a durable bottom</a>. Matrixport said that when the 21-day moving average of its daily sentiment indicator dips below zero and starts to turn up, it suggests that the selling pressure is getting exhausted. Although that doesn’t rule out a decline in the near term, the readings indicate that BTC could be approaching another inflection point.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-45d3-7354-b836-c2acc513d4d1.png"><figcaption><em>Crypto market data daily view. Source: </em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/heatmap/crypto/#%7B%22dataSource%22%3A%22Crypto%22%2C%22blockColor%22%3A%2224h_close_change%7C5%22%2C%22blockSize%22%3A%22market_cap_calc%22%2C%22grouping%22%3A%22no_group%22%7D" target="_blank"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Another positive projection for BTC came from Wells Fargo analyst Ohsung Kwon. In a note seen by CNBC, Kwon said additional savings from tax refunds, mostly from high-income consumers, could <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/wells-fargo-tax-refunds-yolo-trade-bitcoin-stocks-150b">flow into equities and BTC</a>, bringing back the “YOLO” trade.</p><p>Could BTC and the major altcoins overcome the overhead resistance levels? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price prediction</h2><p>BTC has been making higher lows in the short term, but the bulls have failed to push the price above the breakdown level of $74,508.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-4c1c-7ad7-b38d-9eb513404082.png"><figcaption><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/</em><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BINANCE%3ABTCUSDT" target="_blank"><em>TradingView</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>Buyers are likely to make another attempt to pierce the overhead resistance at the 20-day EMA ($72,282) and the $74,508 level. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair may rally to the 50-day SMA ($83,129).</p><p>Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will attempt to defend the 20-day EMA and pull the Bitcoin price below the immediate support at $65,118. If they manage to do that, the pair might tumble to solid support at $60,000.</p><h2>Ether price prediction</h2><p>The bulls have maintained Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH</a>) above the immediate support at $1,897, indicating buying on dips.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-505b-7f83-a405-c8fe1b5fb4ce.png"><figcaption><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Buyers will again attempt to clear the overhead hurdle at the 20-day EMA ($2,183). If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair may start a stronger recovery toward the 50-day SMA ($2,707).&nbsp;</p><p>Contrarily, if the Ether price turns down and breaks below $1,897, it suggests that the bears are attempting to take charge. The pair may then drop to the critical support at $1,750. Buyers are expected to protect the $1,750 level with all their might, as a close below it may sink the pair to $1,537.</p><h2>XRP price prediction</h2><p>XRP (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>) has been trading just below the 20-day EMA ($1.52), indicating that the bulls continue to exert pressure.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-54ae-751d-8c35-13ca205496d5.png"><figcaption><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>That improves the prospects of a break above the 20-day EMA and the breakdown level of $1.61. The XRP price may then climb to the 50-day SMA ($1.80), signaling the XRP/USDT pair may remain inside the channel for some more time.</p><p>Buyers will have to thrust the price above the downtrend line to indicate a potential short-term trend change. On the contrary, a deeper fall might begin if the price turns down and plunges below the support line.</p><h2>BNB price prediction</h2><p>BNB (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index">BNB</a>) has been trading in a narrow range for the past few days, signaling indecision between the bulls and the bears.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-5809-7ce9-8bdd-7c2bb30c859e.png"><figcaption><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>If the BNB price turns down and plummets below the $570 support, it indicates the resumption of the downtrend. The BNB/USDT pair may then extend the decline to the psychological level at $500.</p><p>Buyers will have to push and maintain the price above the 20-day EMA ($676) to suggest that the selling pressure is reducing. The pair may then rally to $730 and subsequently to $790.</p><h2>Solana price prediction</h2><p>Solana (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index">SOL</a>) is facing resistance near the breakdown level of $95, indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-5b56-7585-83e7-55b3e1c5e847.png"><figcaption><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bears will attempt to strengthen their position by pulling the Solana price below the $76 support. If they manage to do that, it suggests that the bears have flipped the $95 level into resistance. The pair may then retest the Feb. 6 low of $67.</p><p>Buyers will have to overcome the $95 overhead hurdle to signal a comeback. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair may ascend to the 50-day SMA ($116), where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dogecoin price prediction</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index">DOGE</a>) has been trading just below the 20-day EMA ($0.10), indicating a lack of selling at lower levels.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-5ea9-7325-b6b7-0feb405d0626.png"><figcaption><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>That increases the likelihood of a rally above the 20-day EMA. The DOGE/USDT pair may then climb to the 50-day SMA ($0.12). Sellers will attempt to halt the recovery at the $0.12 level, but if the bulls overcome the resistance, the Dogecoin price may soar to the $0.16 level.</p><p>Instead, if the price turns down from the $0.12 resistance, it suggests a possible range formation in the near term. The pair might swing between $0.08 and $0.12 for a few days.</p><h2>Bitcoin Cash price prediction</h2><p>Bitcoin Cash (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index">BCH</a>) has been stuck between the moving averages, indicating uncertainty about the next directional move.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-6219-7b70-b403-e374d2e71022.png"><figcaption><em>BCH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The upsloping 20-day EMA ($547) and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a possible upside breakout. If that happens, the Bitcoin Cash price might rally to $600 and, after that, to $630.</p><p>Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it signals that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That might start a correction toward the next support at $500.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/4-data-points-suggest-xrp-price-bottomed-at-dollar1-12-are-bulls-ready-to-take-over"><em><strong>4 data points suggest XRP price bottomed at $1.12: Are bulls ready to take over?</strong></em></a></p><h2>Hyperliquid price prediction</h2><p>Hyperliquid (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/hyperliquid-price-index">HYPE</a>) closed below the 20-day EMA ($30.26) on Tuesday, indicating selling at higher levels.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-6585-7293-89b2-210a42469947.png"><figcaption><em>HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Buyers will attempt to maintain the Hyperliquid price above the 50-day SMA ($27.74), but if the bears prevail, the HYPE/USDT pair may tumble toward the solid support at $20.82. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a range-bound action between $20.82 and $35.50 for some time.</p><p>The first sign of strength for the bulls is a close above the $32.50 level. That opens the doors for a rally to the $35.50 to $38.42 resistance zone.</p><h2>Cardano price prediction</h2><p>Cardano (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index">ADA</a>) has been clinging to the 20-day EMA ($0.29), indicating that the bulls have kept up the pressure.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-68fd-7efd-8efa-7f96eaca1ebb.png"><figcaption><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The possibility of a break above the 20-day EMA remains high. If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair may climb toward the downtrend line, which is expected to act as a stiff resistance. If buyers pierce the downtrend line, the Cardano price may rally to $0.44 and then to $0.50.</p><p>Sellers will have to tug the price below the support line to regain control. If they manage to do that, the pair might slump toward $0.15.</p><h2>Monero price prediction</h2><p>Monero (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xmr-price-index">XMR</a>) remains below the breakdown level of $360, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to slip below the immediate support at $309.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c7190-6c5d-7fe0-9817-a09cfc7a9882.png"><figcaption><em>XMR/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>Buyers will have to thrust the Monero price above the 20-day EMA ($366) to gain the upper hand. The XMR/USDT pair may then climb to the 50-day SMA ($449), where the bears are expected to step in.</p><p>On the downside, a break and close below the $309 level indicates that the bears remain in control. The pair may then retest the crucial $276 support. A strong rebound off the $276 level might result in a range-bound action for a few days.</p></div><p><span>This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

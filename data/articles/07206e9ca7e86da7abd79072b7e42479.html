<p>iPhone 18 Pro is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/26/iphone-18-pro-six-new-features-are-coming-later-this-year/">rumored</a> to get a next-gen C2 modem, enabling <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/12/iphone-18-pros-new-c2-chip-will-bring-three-advantages-over-iphone-17/">several new advantages</a> for Apple’s flagship. But an analyst report says there’s a new N2 chip coming to iPhone 18 Pro as well, continuing an exciting trend.</p>



<h2>Apple silicon is expanding and surprising with new chips</h2>



<figure><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/09/Apple-Silicon-chips.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all" alt="Apple Silicon chip arm iPhone iPad Mac" /></figure>



<p>Not long ago, the phrase ‘Apple silicon’ referred exclusively to the main processor in products like the iPhone, Mac, or iPad. For example, the A19 chip in iPhone 17 and M5 in the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro.</p>



<p>But as of last year, Apple’s silicon teams now make 5G modems and wireless chips in-house too.</p>



<p>These may sound like fairly boring iPhone components, but Apple’s offerings so far have been more exciting than you might think.</p>



<p>When the C1 modem debuted in iPhone 16e, it came with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/14/apples-new-c1-brings-two-killer-features-and-its-just-the-start/">unexpected advantages</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>improvements to battery life</li>



<li>better performance in congested data spots</li>
</ul>



<p>C1 offers the basics of 5G data and other cellular connectivity essentials, but with extra Apple perks.</p>



<p>The follow-up C1X <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/09/apple-debuts-new-c1x-in-house-modem-the-successor-to-c1/">launched</a> later in the year with iPhone Air and the M5 iPad Pro, and it pushed the chip even further. C1X offered speeds up to twice as fast as the C1.</p>



<p>Also last fall, Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/09/apple-iphone-17-bluetooth-wifi/">debuted</a> its N1 wireless chip.</p>



<p>N1 combines Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread. Nothing exciting there. Except, like with C1, there was more to the story.</p>



<p>Apple says that N1 “improves the overall performance and reliability of features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop.” It also comes with battery gains for a variety of reasons <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/22/apple-explains-n1-chips-unique-advantages-in-iphone-17/">explained here</a>.</p>



<p>But as you would expect, Apple’s silicon team has even more coming.</p>



<h2>N2 and C2 are coming to iPhone 18 Pro</h2>

<p>Analyst Jeff Pu, in a research note seen by <em>9to5Mac</em>, says Apple will have two new chips ready to launch this fall.</p>



<p>Per Pu, the forthcoming iPhone 18 Pro will have a next-gen N2 chip and C2 modem.</p>



<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/09/17/iphone-fold-and-iphone-18-pro-set-to-get-faster-mobile-data/">Prior reporting</a> has outlined what’s coming with C2, such as the expected addition of mmWave 5G support.</p>



<p>While there are no specific details on what’s changing with N2, I have no doubt Apple will make meaningful improvements.</p>



<p>The Apple silicon team has been able to build surprise benefits and improvements into its C-class modems already in such a short time. This week’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/13/ios-26-3-adds-unique-new-privacy-feature-and-its-apple-at-its-best/">new iOS 26.3 privacy feature</a> is the latest evidence.</p>



<p>All of this makes me excited to see what Apple has planned for N2. </p>



<p>Taking greater control of the iPhone’s tech stack is clearly providing greater opportunities for new features and improvements. I’m ready to see what’s next.</p>



<p>What do you expect from Apple’s N2 and C2 in the iPhone 18 Pro? Let us know in the comments.</p>

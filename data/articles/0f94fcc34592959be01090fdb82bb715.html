<hr><ul><li><strong>Evidence of a Now Playing app has been found in Android code</strong></li><li><strong>This would mean the Pixel's Now Playing feature would be moved to a dedicated app</strong></li><li><strong>That's likely to lead to upgrades for this somewhat neglected tool</strong></li></ul><hr><p>Now Playing is a feature that’s been present on Pixel phones since the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-pixel-2-review">Google Pixel 2</a> series, but while it’s been a built-in feature all this time, it seems that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/google">Google</a> is planning to give it a dedicated app instead.</p><p>This is according to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2026/02/14/pixel-now-playing-app/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, which has found a code string in a new version of Android System Intelligence that mentions a Now Playing app you can “upgrade” to by downloading it from the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/tag/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a>.</p><p>On top of that, an icon for the Now Playing app – which you can see below – had previously been dug up.</p><figure><div><p>

</p></div><figcaption><span>(Image credit: Google / 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So while this change hasn’t been officially confirmed by Google yet, it looks very likely that it’s coming.</p><p>Right now, the Now Playing feature will work in the background on your Pixel phone to identify songs that it hears playing, and then you can find those identified songs in the Now Playing section of your phone’s settings menu. It’s a useful, unintrusive feature, but it has some limitations and issues.</p><p>For one thing, having to dig several menus deep into settings to find a list of identified songs isn’t ideal, and for another, your Now Playing history isn’t synced to a new device when you change phones.</p><h2>A likely upgrade – but only for Pixels</h2><p>Having a dedicated app could potentially fix both of those problems, and might make it easier for Google to introduce or improve other features too. Again, none of that is confirmed, but we can’t see why Google would turn Now Playing into a dedicated app if it didn’t plan to upgrade the feature. So hopefully this will be a good change.</p><div><section><p>Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.</p></section></div><p>As for when we’ll see this app, 9to5Google speculates that it might land as part of the next Pixel Feature Drop in March.</p><p>However, if you were hoping this move to an installable app meant that Now Playing would be available on devices other than just Pixels, you're probably out of luck, as <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-now-playing-app-play-store-3641143/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has done some of its own digging and found signs that at least for now it will remain a Pixel-exclusive feature.</p><hr><p><em></em><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

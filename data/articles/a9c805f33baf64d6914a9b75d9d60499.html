    <div><div><p>Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun has rolled out a new feature that shifts rewards toward memecoin traders rather than its deployers — a tweak to its fee model that once generated over $15 million in a single day at its peak.</p><p>In a post to X on Tuesday, Pump.fun <a href="https://x.com/Pumpfun/status/2023781347831971916" target="_blank">said</a> the platform’s memecoin creators can now decide whether a token “truly deserves” Creator Fees, or whether it’s best to redirect rewards to traders engaging with the token through “Cashback Coins.”&nbsp; </p><p>Pump.fun’s original model features Creator Fees, giving token creators <a href="https://pump.fun/docs/fees" target="_blank">0.3%</a> of all fees generated by the tokens they launch.</p><p>However, Pump.fun said not all tokens deserve Creator Fees because <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/raydium-unveils-memecoin-creator-launchlab-compete-pump-fun">many tokens achieve success</a> without a team or project lead, thereby disproportionately rewarding token deployers. </p><blockquote><div><p>Creator Fees need change. Not every token deserves Creator Fees.</p><p>Now, users have the ability to decide whether a token truly deserves Creator Fees, or whether it makes more sense to reward the traders engaging with the token.</p><p>Cashback Coins are now live. Learn more <a href="https://t.co/UbYoAbQ1Ya">pic.twitter.com/UbYoAbQ1Ya</a></p></div>— Pump.fun (@Pumpfun) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pumpfun/status/2023781347831971916?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></blockquote> <blockquote>“Now, traders can choose to engage with tokens they feel the most aligned with, ultimately letting the market decide who gets rewarded and where the bar is set.”</blockquote><p>Pump.fun said coin creators must choose between the Creator Fees or Trader Cashback model before launching. Once chosen, the decision is irreversible.</p><p>Terminal, a crypto trading platform built into Pump.fun, <a href="https://x.com/TradingTerminal/status/2023782266061910256" target="_blank">said</a> Cashback Coins are generated on every trade made and are only accessible through Terminal.</p><p>It comes as analysts from onchain analytics firm Santiment said on Friday that memecoins are <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/memecoin-season-crypto-social-media-sentiment-low-santiment" target="_self">showing signs of a potential bottom</a>. </p><p>“This collective acceptance of the ‘end of the meme era’ is a classic capitulation signal,” Santiment said, explaining that when a sector of the market is completely written off, it is often the “contrarian time” to start paying attention. </p><h2>Pump.fun fees have fallen over the last year</h2><p>Pump.fun’s new rewards feature comes as it <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/pump.fun?events=false&amp;groupBy=monthly" target="_blank">recorded</a> $31.8 million worth of fees in January, marking a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pump-fun-revenue-drops-2025-solana-memecoins">75.6% fall</a> from the $148.1 million posted in January 2025 — the platform’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-pump-fun-captured-80-of-solana-memecoins-and-can-it-last">best-performing month</a> to date.</p><p>Pump.fun has brought in $15.6 million so far in February, putting it on track <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/letsbonk-overtakes-pumpfun-solana-memecoins">to fall short</a> of its January total.</p><figure> <img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2026-02/019c6f42-cc69-7105-9b04-fdc13ec725ed.png"><figcaption><em>Monthly change in Pump.fun fees since March 2024.

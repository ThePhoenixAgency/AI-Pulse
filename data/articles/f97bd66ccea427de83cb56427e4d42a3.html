    <div><div><h2>Bitcoin could fall to $10,000 as U.S. recession risk builds, Mike McGlone says</h2><h2>McGlone links bitcoin’s downturn to record U.S. market cap-to-GDP levels, low equity volatility and rising gold prices, warning of potential contagion into stocks.</h2><p><span>Updated Feb 16, 2026, 2:21 p.m. </span><span>Published Feb 16, 2026, 2:06 p.m. </span></p></div><div><p>Bloomberg Intelligence macro strategist Mike McGlone said Monday that collapsing crypto prices may signal broader financial stress, warning bitcoin could revert toward $10,000 and potentially foreshadow the next U.S. recession.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/mikemcglone11/status/2023108014824173698" target="_blank">a post on X</a>, McGlone also said the long-standing “buy the dip” mentality that has supported risk assets since 2008 could be breaking down as digital assets weaken and volatility dynamics shift.</p><div><p><span>STORY CONTINUES BELOW</span></p></div><p>After climbing back to $70,841 by 07:00 UTC on Feb. 15 from $65,395 late on Feb. 12, bitcoin was hovering around $68,800 by mid-morning. The <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/02/16/crypto-market-drowns-in-red-as-bitcoin-falls-to-usd68-000">broader crypto market was also in the red</a> Monday, with 85 of the top 100 tokens posting losses. Privacy-focused coins monero and zcash were down 10% and 8%, respectively over the past 24 hours.</p><p>“Healthy Correction is what we should hear soon from stock market analysts (who risk unemployment if not onboard), following collapsing cryptos,” McGlone wrote. “The buy the dips mantra since 2008 may be over.”</p><p>McGlone pointed to several macro indicators that reflect elevated risk conditions. U.S. stock market capitalization relative to gross domestic product (GDP) has reached its highest level in roughly a century, he noted. At the same time, 180-day volatility in the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 is at its lowest level in about eight years, McGlone added.</p><p>He also described the “crypto bubble” as “imploding,” adding that “Trump euphoria” has peaked and is contributing to contagion across markets. Meanwhile, gold and silver are “grabbing alpha” at a pace last seen about half a century ago, with rising volatility that he said could “trickle up” into equities.</p><p>McGlone shared a chart comparing bitcoin divided by 10 for scaling, with the S&amp;P 500. As of Feb. 13, both were hovering below 7,000 on his graphic. He said that “volatile and beta-dependent” bitcoin is unlikely to stay above that level if broader equity beta weakens.</p><p>The Bloomberg analyst identified 5,600 on the S&amp;P 500, equivalent to roughly $56,000 for bitcoin under his scaling, as an initial “normal reversion” level. Beyond that, part of his base case calls for bitcoin to revert toward $10,000, contingent on a peak in the U.S. stock market.</p><h2>McGlone’s outlook splits opinion</h2><p>Jason Fernandes, co-founder of AdLunam and a market analyst, told CoinDesk that McGlone’s thesis assumes market extremes must resolve through collapse and that bitcoin’s equity beta guarantees a proportional crash.</p><p>“That’s false equivalence and single-path bias,” Fernandes said. “Markets can also resolve excess through time, rotation, or inflation erosion. A macro slowdown could mean consolidation or a $40,000 to $50,000 reset, not a systemic unwind to $10,000.”</p><p>Fernandes added that a move toward $10,000 would likely require a true systemic event, including sharp liquidity contraction, widening credit spreads, forced deleveraging across funds and a disorderly equity drawdown.</p><p>“That implies recession plus financial stress, not just slower growth,” he said. “Absent a credit shock or policy mistake that drains global liquidity, that kind of collapse remains a low-probability tail risk.”</p></div><div><p>More For You</p><div><p>'We do not do illegal things': Inside a U.S.-sanctioned stablecoin issuer's race to build a crypto giant</p><div><p>5 hours ago</p></div><figure><img alt="Oleg Ogienko, director for regulatory and overseas affairs at A7A5, at Consensus in Hong Kong (provided)" src="https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F238e8417f724d49356943e426db32a2ff0a80efa-926x999.png%3Frect%3D0%2C192%2C926%2C521%26w%3D1920%26h%3D1080%26auto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure><p>Oleg Ogienko, the public face of A7A5, pitched the ruble-pegged stablecoin as a fast-growing trade rail built to move money across borders despite sanctions pressure.

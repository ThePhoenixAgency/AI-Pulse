  <div class="content">
    <p><p><a href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a>, a San Francisco-based cloud platform that has quietly amassed two million developers without spending a dollar on marketing, announced Thursday that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, as surging demand for artificial intelligence applications exposes the limitations of legacy cloud infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://tq.vc/">TQ Ventures</a> led the round, with participation from <a href="https://fpvventures.com/">FPV Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.redpoint.com/">Redpoint</a>, and <a href="https://www.unusual.vc/">Unusual Ventures</a>. The investment values Railway as one of the most significant infrastructure startups to emerge during the AI boom, capitalizing on developer frustration with the complexity and cost of traditional platforms like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a>.</p><p>&quot;As AI models get better at writing code, more and more people are asking the age-old question: where, and how, do I run my applications?&quot; said Jake Cooper, Railway&#x27;s 28-year-old founder and chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;The last generation of cloud primitives were slow and outdated, and now with AI moving everything faster, teams simply can&#x27;t keep up.&quot;</p><p>The funding is a dramatic acceleration for a company that has charted an unconventional path through the cloud computing industry. Railway raised just $24 million in total before this round, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/31/railway-snags-20m-to-streamline-the-process-of-deploying-apps-and-services/">$20 million Series A</a> from Redpoint in 2022. The company now processes more than 10 million deployments monthly and handles over one trillion requests through its edge network — metrics that rival far larger and better-funded competitors.</p><h2><b>Why three-minute deploy times have become unacceptable in the age of AI coding assistants</b></h2><p>Railway&#x27;s pitch rests on a simple observation: the tools developers use to deploy and manage software were designed for a slower era. A standard build-and-deploy cycle using <a href="https://station.railway.com/feedback/terraform-provider-954567d7">Terraform</a>, the industry-standard infrastructure tool, takes two to three minutes. That delay, once tolerable, has become a critical bottleneck as AI coding assistants like <a href="https://claude.ai/login">Claude</a>, <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>, and <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a> can generate working code in seconds.</p><p>&quot;When godly intelligence is on tap and can solve any problem in three seconds, those amalgamations of systems become bottlenecks,&quot; Cooper told VentureBeat. &quot;What was really cool for humans to deploy in 10 seconds or less is now table stakes for agents.&quot;</p><p>The company claims its platform delivers deployments in under one second — fast enough to keep pace with AI-generated code. Customers report a tenfold increase in developer velocity and up to 65 percent cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.</p><p>These numbers come directly from enterprise clients, not internal benchmarks. Daniel Lobaton, chief technology officer at G2X, a platform serving 100,000 federal contractors, measured deployment speed improvements of seven times faster and an 87 percent cost reduction after migrating to Railway. His infrastructure bill dropped from $15,000 per month to approximately $1,000.</p><p>&quot;The work that used to take me a week on our previous infrastructure, I can do in Railway in like a day,&quot; Lobaton said. &quot;If I want to spin up a new service and test different architectures, it would take so long on our old setup. In Railway I can launch six services in two minutes.&quot;</p><h2><b>Inside the controversial decision to abandon Google Cloud and build data centers from scratch</b></h2><p>What distinguishes <a href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a> from competitors like <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> and <a href="http://fly.io">Fly.io</a> is the depth of its vertical integration. In 2024, the company made the unusual decision to abandon Google Cloud entirely and build its own data centers, a move that echoes the famous Alan Kay maxim: &quot;People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We wanted to design hardware in a way where we could build a differentiated experience,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;Having full control over the network, compute, and storage layers lets us do really fast build and deploy loops, the kind that allows us to move at &#x27;agentic speed&#x27; while staying 100 percent the smoothest ride in town.&quot;</p><p>The approach paid dividends during recent <a href="https://restofworld.org/2026/cloud-outages-2025-global-business-impact/">widespread outages</a> that affected major cloud providers — Railway remained online throughout.</p><p>This soup-to-nuts control enables pricing that undercuts the hyperscalers by roughly 50 percent and newer cloud startups by three to four times. Railway charges by the second for actual compute usage: $0.00000386 per gigabyte-second of memory, $0.00000772 per vCPU-second, and $0.00000006 per gigabyte-second of storage. There are no charges for idle virtual machines — a stark contrast to the traditional cloud model where customers pay for provisioned capacity whether they use it or not.</p><p>&quot;The conventional wisdom is that the big guys have economies of scale to offer better pricing,&quot; Cooper noted. &quot;But when they&#x27;re charging for VMs that usually sit idle in the cloud, and we&#x27;ve purpose-built everything to fit much more density on these machines, you have a big opportunity.&quot;</p><h2><b>How 30 employees built a platform generating tens of millions in annual revenue</b></h2><p><a href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a> has achieved its scale with a team of just 30 employees generating tens of millions in annual revenue — a ratio of revenue per employee that would be exceptional even for established software companies. The company grew revenue 3.5 times last year and continues to expand at 15 percent month-over-month.</p><p>Cooper emphasized that the fundraise was strategic rather than necessary. &quot;We&#x27;re default alive; there&#x27;s no reason for us to raise money,&quot; he said. &quot;We raised because we see a massive opportunity to accelerate, not because we needed to survive.&quot;</p><p>The company hired its first salesperson only last year and employs just two solutions engineers. Nearly all of Railway&#x27;s two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.</p><p>&quot;We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come,&quot; Cooper recalled. &quot;And to some degree, they came.&quot;</p><h2><b>From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway&#x27;s unlikely corporate expansion</b></h2><p>Despite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.</p><p>Notable customers include <a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/">Bilt</a>, the loyalty program company; Intuit&#x27;s <a href="https://www.goco.io/">GoCo</a> subsidiary; TripAdvisor&#x27;s <a href="https://www.cruisecritic.com/">Cruise Critic</a>; and <a href="https://www.mgmresorts.com/en.html">MGM Resorts</a>. <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/kernel">Kernel</a>, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.</p><p>&quot;At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS,&quot; said Rafael Garcia, Kernel&#x27;s chief technology officer. &quot;Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012.&quot;</p><p>For enterprise customers, <a href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a> offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer&#x27;s existing cloud environment through a &quot;bring your own cloud&quot; configuration.</p><p>Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).</p><h2><b>The startup&#x27;s bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivals</b></h2><p>Railway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.</p><p>Cooper argues that Railway&#x27;s competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.</p><p>&quot;The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven&#x27;t gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money,&quot; he observed. &quot;They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don&#x27;t really need to?&quot;</p><p>Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. &quot;We&#x27;re not just containers; we&#x27;ve got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster.&quot;</p><p>The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.</p><h2><b>Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists today</b></h2><p>Railway&#x27;s fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>, <a href="https://cursor.com/agents">Cursor</a>, and <a href="https://claude.ai/login">Claude</a> become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.</p><p>&quot;The amount of software that&#x27;s going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we&#x27;re talking a thousand times more software,&quot; Cooper predicted. &quot;All of that has to run somewhere.&quot;</p><p>The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls &quot;loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically.&quot; Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.</p><p>&quot;The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes,&quot; Cooper said. &quot;You don&#x27;t have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity.&quot;</p><h2><b>What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experience</b></h2><p><a href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a> plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company&#x27;s five-year history.</p><p>&quot;One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business,&quot; Cooper explained. &quot;We&#x27;ve built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what&#x27;s been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage.&quot;</p><p>The company&#x27;s investor roster reads like a who&#x27;s who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include <a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner,</a> co-founder of GitHub; <a href="https://rauchg.com/about">Guillermo Rauch</a>, chief executive of Vercel; <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/author/spencer-kimball/">Spencer Kimball</a>, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/about/leadership/">Olivier Pomel</a>, chief executive of Datadog; and <a href="https://sequoiacap.com/founder/jori-lallo/">Jori Lallo</a>, co-founder of Linear.</p><p>The timing of Railway&#x27;s expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper&#x27;s telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.</p><p>Whether <a href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a> can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a>, and <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.</p><p>&quot;In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period,&quot; he said. &quot;Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That&#x27;s the prize worth playing for, and there&#x27;s no bigger one on offer.&quot;</p><p>For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.</p></p>

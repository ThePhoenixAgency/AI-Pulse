Today, Sony announced the WF-1000XM6, the successor to the popular <a href="https://www.neowin.net/deals/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-are-down-to-the-lowest-price-of-229/">WF-1000XM5</a>. The new WF-1000XM6 brings meaningful upgrades that should appeal not only to existing WF-1000XM5 owners but also to users of Apple and Bose earbuds.</p> <p>First, Sony has redesigned the earbuds for a better fit. The company says the new shape follows the natural curves of the inner ear to reduce discomfort and improve stability. Compared to the previous model, the WF-1000XM6 is 11% slimmer. Sony has also added a new ventilation structure to increase airflow and reduce internal noises such as footsteps and chewing. The earbuds come in two colors: Black and Platinum Silver. Sony has also redesigned the charging case, making it easier to open with one hand.</p> <figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770966016_sony_wf-1000xm6_truly_wireless_earbuds_fit.webp"><img alt="Sony WF-1000XM6 Truly Wireless Earbuds Fit" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770966016_sony_wf-1000xm6_truly_wireless_earbuds_fit_story.webp"></a></figure> <p>Noise cancellation remains one of Sony’s biggest selling points. With this generation, Sony claims a further 25% reduction in noise compared to the WF-1000XM5. The company says mid-to-high frequency noise cancellation has improved, thanks to the updated HD Noise Canceling Processor QN3e and a four-microphone setup (one more than the WF-1000XM5).</p> <p>The Integrated Processor V2 returns from the previous model and powers the Adaptive Noise Canceling Optimizer feature. Sony says it now analyzes external noise and wearing conditions in real time more extensively than before. Sony also highlighted its Noise Isolation Earbud Tips, which will be available in four sizes, as another contributor to improved noise cancellation.</p> <figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770962323_sony_wf-1000xm6_truly_wireless_earbuds_.webp"><img alt="Sony WF-1000XM6" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2026/02/1770962323_sony_wf-1000xm6_truly_wireless_earbuds__story.webp"></a></figure> <p>Sony is also pitching better sound quality. The WF-1000XM6 uses the new QN3e processor alongside the Integrated Processor V2, which now supports 32-bit processing, up from 24-bit on the WF-1000XM5. Sony also developed a new driver unit with a redesigned diaphragm made from multiple materials. The company says the softer edge improves bass response, while the lightweight, rigid dome delivers clearer and more extended high frequencies.</p> <p>For calls, Sony claims the WF-1000XM6 improves on its predecessor with two microphones and a bone-conduction sensor on each earbud, plus an AI beamforming noise-reduction algorithm.</p> <p>Like its predecessor, the WF-1000XM6 supports Hi-Res Audio Wireless, DSEE Extreme, 360 Reality Audio compatibility, head tracking, and Background Music Effect. Bluetooth connectivity has also been upgraded with improved algorithms and antennas that are 1.5x larger than the previous model. The earbuds also support the LE Audio standard for ultra-low latency audio streaming.</p> <p>Sony claims up to 8 hours of playback on a single charge, and up to 24 hours with the charging case. The case also supports Qi wireless charging.</p> <div>

    <div><div><p>Researchers and citizen scientists will, for the first time, tag and track 10,000 bogong moths as they travel hundreds of kilometres from the Australian Alps to breeding grounds across the country’s south-east.</p><p>The massive moth-tagging project was modelled on <a href="https://monarchwatch.org/tagging/">Monarch Watch</a>, a citizen science program that has traced the migration of monarch butterflies across North America over decades. Both species undertake long-distance journeys, with butterflies travelling by day and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/18/bogong-moths-stars-navigate-australia-study">bogong moths by night</a>.</p><p>A team of scientists and volunteers will next week travel to Mount Kosciuszko to begin attaching numbered paper tags – each the size of a piece of confetti – to 10,000 moths using eyelash glue.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p><p>“It’s low-tech, high-effort tagging, where you put a little sticker on an individual moth and see if you can catch it again,” said Dr Kate Umbers, an associate professor in zoology at Western Sydney University and the managing director of Invertebrates Australia.</p><p>For bogong moths, it is “the very first time this has ever been tried”.</p><figure><div><img alt="A tagged bogong moth" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e2372a8713d4e018ceb254f36ce551eb303c2f/707_0_5800_4640/master/5800.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Attaching a tiny tag to a bogong moth is ‘laborious and time-consuming’ but not as difficult as one might think. </span> Photograph: Seb Judkins</figcaption></figure><p>The aim is to address knowledge gaps about where the moths breed and the routes they take to get there – gaps that saw the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/09/massive-swarms-of-bogong-moths-once-resembled-rain-clouds-then-their-numbers-crashed-to-earth">species knocked back</a> from being listed as threatened under national environment laws. The bogong moth has been on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/really-sad-moment-iconic-bogong-moth-among-124-australian-additions-to-endangered-species-list">International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s global endangered list</a> since 2021.</p><p>While there were indirect tools for mapping the moths’ journey, such as using genetic and chemical analysis, tagging was the only sure way to know that “an individual has travelled from point A to point B”, Umbers said.</p><p>Attaching a tiny tag to a critter the size of a bottle cap is not as difficult as people might think.</p><p>“It’s laborious and time-consuming,” Umbers said. “You have to be precise, but it’s not difficult.”</p><figure></figure><p>Each moth will be cooled down and temporarily anaesthetised using carbon dioxide before the tiny paper label is attached to its wing. Then it is free to go. The procedure has been thoroughly studied in the lab and researchers were confident the tags would not hurt the moths or affect their behaviour.</p><p>The goal of 10,000 tags was set to increase the odds of moths being re-sighted. But the task is “quite doable” once the work is divided among 20 researchers and volunteers over 10 days.</p><p>From there, people in south-eastern states were encouraged to keep an eye out for tagged moths along their journey.</p><h2>Drawn to the light of dozens of households</h2><p>More than 50 households, spread in all directions from Mount Kosciuszko, have been chosen to act as “sentinels”, hosting bug lanterns and monitoring moths between March and May.</p><figure><div><img alt="A bug lantern hung on a door" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c714841c2e313c3af4befd7fceb13cfc9a87533/0_85_4284_5345/master/4284.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none"></div><figcaption><span></span><span>Bug lanterns have been installed in more than 50 households to help attract the tagged bogong moths.</span> Photograph: Kate Umbers</figcaption></figure><p>Louise Freckelton, who runs a sheep farm near Adelong in the New South Wales Riverina, was excited to be chosen.</p><p>She already had an interest in the nocturnal environment. The property has a farm-stay certified by DarkSky International for its commitment to limiting artificial light at night, and two-thirds of the land is protected for conservation.</p><p>“We’re deeply interested in the environment and ecology, and we know the pygmy possums up in the mountains rely on the bogong moths to turn up when they wake up out of their winter hibernation,” Freckelton said. “We know the perils for them and the pygmy possums.</p><figure><div><figcaption><span></span><span>Bogong moths and the traditional owners scaling mountains to track them – video</span></figcaption></div></figure><p>“We are very conscious we live in both a climate and an extinction crisis, and this is a tiny way we can help.”</p><figure></figure><p>Suzanne Newnham, who lives on a bush block outside Wee Jasper, about 45km from Canberra, was also thrilled to be selected.</p><p>“I love bugs,” she said. “If we put a light on outside, we have so many moths it’s not funny. I thought it’d be interesting to be able to track them.”</p><p>If a member of the public is lucky enough to spot one of the tagged moths, they are encouraged to take a photo, or record the two-letter, two-number code on the paper, and submit it via <a href="http://bogong.org/">bogong.org</a>.</p><p>“We need eyes out, all over, all of the time,” Umbers said.</p><p>Even a single sighting of a tagged moth would provide powerful evidence, Umbers said.</p><p>“If we saw 100 of our tagged moths again, it would be an amazing success.”</p><figure></figure></div></div>

  <div class="content">
    <div><div> <p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-news">Apple News</a> is an aggregation app run by human curators and algorithmic feeds, but a poorly handled study failed to catch the right-wing outlets shared, and now the FTC is involved.
</p><p>Whether or not the FTC can claim jurisdiction over what content can be highlighted by an independent editorial team might be up for debate, but the content of the Apple News app is not. Right-leaning outlets are sometimes featured in the curated Top Stories and Spotlight sections, but one study somehow missed that.
</p><p>The study was cited by various right-wing outlets and shared by the President on his personal social media platform, but none detailed exactly how the study arrived at its conclusion. The report has now led to Trump-appointed FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson to send a letter to Apple CEO <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/tim-cook">Tim Cook</a> to warn him that Apple could be in violation of a law.
</p><blockquote><p>Today I sent a letter to Tim Cook expressing my concerns about allegations that Apple News has, unbeknownst to its users, systematically promoted news articles from left-wing news outlets and suppressed content from conservative publications. <a href="https://t.co/xXCxNgRbpc">pic.twitter.com/xXCxNgRbpc</a></p>— Andrew Ferguson (@AFergusonFTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFergusonFTC/status/2021704472687218936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote><p>The freedom of speech and press apparently doesn't apply when discussing a news aggregator owned by a tech company, though such a suggestion would have to stand up in the court of law. Ferguson claims Apple could be found in violation of attempting to manipulate its customers with left-leaning views and propaganda.
</p><p>Specifically, he cites Section 5 of the FTC Act which "prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices" including "material misrepresentations and material omissions." The argument is that Apple claims neutrality in its terms of service, and this report is evidence that it doesn't.
</p><p>Of course, this is all based on a report that isn't fully representative of Apple News, so there's likely not much of a case here. Let's dive into the study.
</p><h2>Right-winged watchdog cries wolf</h2><p>Apparently, a free speech and censorship watchdog called MRC <a href="https://mrcfreespeechamerica.org/blogs/free-speech/heather-moon/2026/02/04/apple-news-continues-rejection-right-leaning-outlets">released a study</a> where they opened Apple News each day in January, at either 10:30 a.m. or 8:30 a.m. and noted which outlets held the top news stories slots. The group's executive team is a series of right-winged folks with backgrounds in politics and business, and their website seems to be a combination of extreme headlines and sliver dollar sales.

Image source: MRC</span></p></div><p>The study, on its face, is flawed. It claimed to use the AllSides Media Bias Chart to qualify which outlets were left or right-leaning, then listed which notable outlets were considered.
</p><p>The study said that it looked for outlets like <em>Daily Mail</em> and <em>New York Post</em>, which both publish on the platform. However, the study also said it looked for content from <em>Breitbart</em> or <em>The Gateway</em> — neither of which publish on Apple News.
</p><p>The methodology was very odd, as it could mean that if the <em>Fox News</em> evening posts were featured, they'd be missed by the study's morning check. A brief glance as of this writing shows a <em>Fox News</em> story in the featured section that was published around 5 p.m. ET.

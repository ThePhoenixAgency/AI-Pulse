  <div class="content"><p>Apple released for iPhone users everywhere this week. The update focuses a lot on interoperability between iPhone and Android devices, privacy, and more. Here are all of the new features in iOS 26.3. Updated February 12, 2026 with release information. Table of contentsiOS 26.3 new featuresAndroid transferLimit location data sharingMore EU featuresWallpapersSecurity fixesiOS 26.3 wrap up iOS 26.3 new features Android transfer The big change in iOS 26.3 is a new “Transfer to Android” system, which makes it easier for an iPhone user to switch to an Android device. This new system was developed as part of a joint collaboration between Apple and Google. The latest Android beta adds a similar system for switching from Android to iPhone. The goal is to improve interoperability between the two platforms. “Place your Android device next to this iPhone to get connected and begin the transfer process,” Apple explains in the Settings app. Once the two devices are connected, the iPhone user can wirelessly transfer their photos, messages, notes, apps, and more to their new Android device. The system also transfers the user’s phone number to the new device. Apple notes, however, that sensitive information like Health data, Bluetooth devices, locked notes, and more is not transferred to the Android device as part of this process. Apple and Google, however, say that new data types will be added as they continue the testing process across both platforms. Limit location data sharing iOS 26.3 includes a new privacy feature: “limit precise location.” In a support document, Apple says that this lets you “limit some information that cellular networks may use to determine your location.” For example, your carrier might only be able to determine the neighborhood where your device is located, rather than a specific address. To use this new feature, you’ll need: iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, or iPad Pro (M5) Wi-Fi + Cellular iOS 26.3 or later A supported carrier: Germany: Telekom United Kingdom: EE, BT United States: Boost Mobile Thailand: AIS, True You can find the new toggle by opening the Settings app, tapping Cellular, and tapping Cellular Data Options. More EU features In addition to the new Notification Forwarding feature, the EU confirmed that iOS 26.3 includes these changes: Proximity pairing similar to AirPods for third-party accessories: More info New NFC features for using an iPhone to initiate connected devices without the presence of an iPhone: More info High-bandwidth Wi-Fi connection for peer-to-peer use: More info This is what’s being used to power the new Android-iPhone switching features, too. In a statement to 9to5Mac, the European Union addressed these new features: New opportunities are brought to&nbsp;European&nbsp;users as result of&nbsp;the&nbsp;DMA&nbsp;implementation work.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Commission welcomes&nbsp;the&nbsp;updates that Apple introduced. Developers can now test interoperability with two new features that are&nbsp;the&nbsp;subject of last March’s specification decision on interoperability of connected devices with iOS (such as smartwatches, headphones or TVs).The&nbsp;features released by Apple in&nbsp;the&nbsp;beta version of iOS 26.3 are expected to be fully available in&nbsp;Europe&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;course of 2026. The&nbsp;DMA&nbsp;creates new opportunities for developers to bring to market innovative products and services in&nbsp;Europe. This is another step towards a more inter-connected digital ecosystem to&nbsp;the&nbsp;benefit of all&nbsp;EU&nbsp;citizens. The betas of iOS 26.3 also included a Notification Forwarding feature, which allowed third-party devices to display notifications forwarded from the iPhone. This option, however, is not in the final released version of iOS 26.3. Wallpapers Apple has made some small changes to the wallpapers menu on iPhone with iOS 26.3. Previously, there was one single category for Weather and Astronomy wallpapers. In iOS 26.3, that category is split into two individual sections. The actual wallpapers here are the same. The difference is that Apple has added a few new pre-built wallpapers in the Weather category. As always, the Weather wallpapers display “live weather conditions for your current location.” The Astronomy wallpapers show you the current astronomical positioning of the earth or the Solar System. Security fixes Finally, iOS 26.3 has fixes for more than 35 security vulnerabilities. At least one of those vulnerabilities was exploited in the wild, Apple says. iOS 26.3 has fixes for 35+ security issues on iPhone, details here iOS 26.3 wrap up As you can see, iOS 26.3 is a smaller update than iOS 26.2. Still, there are several nice changes for iPhone users. Have you noticed anything new in iOS 26.3? If so, let us know down in the comments. You can update by going to the Settings app, choosing General, then choosing Software Update.

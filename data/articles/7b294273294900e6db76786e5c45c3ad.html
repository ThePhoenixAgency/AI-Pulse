          <p><a href="https://mitchellh.com/?ref=itsfoss.com">Mitchell Hashimoto</a> from Vagrant, Terraform, HashiCorp, and <a href="https://itsfoss.com/ghostty-terminal-features/">Ghostty</a> fame has introduced <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch?ref=itsfoss.com">Vouch</a>, new trust management system for open source projects.</p><p>With this in place, maintainers <strong>can implement a trust-based system</strong> where contributors must be vouched before submitting code to designated areas.</p><p>The system also allows blocking bad actors entirely through a denouncement feature and maintains a simple list of approved and blocked contributors for easy management (<em>stored as a </em><a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/blob/main/VOUCHED.example.td?ref=itsfoss.com"><em>.td</em></a><em> file</em>).</p><p>Thanks to this, <strong>vouch lists of other projects can be aggregated to create a network</strong> where open source projects can check if someone is already trusted elsewhere. This means contributors don't need to get vouched separately for every project they want to contribute to.</p><p>Vouch also has a <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/tree/main/action?ref=itsfoss.com">GitHub</a> integration that can check pull requests and auto-close ones from unvouched users and lets maintainers vouch or denounce people by commenting on issues, and a CLI that can be used to check user status, add people to the vouch list, or denounce them.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/blob/main/FAQ.md?ref=itsfoss.com">FAQ</a> for Vouch also clarifies how the vouching itself would work:</p><blockquote>There's no reason for getting vouched to be difficult. The primary thing Vouch prevents is low-effort drive-by contributions. For my projects (even this one), you can get vouched by simply introducing yourself in an issue and describing how you'd like to contribute.</blockquote><blockquote>Basically: introduce yourself like any normal human social environment, and you're vouched. If you abuse your privilege in the group, then you'll be denounced.<p>Ultimately, Vouch does not impose any policy. Policy is up to downstream projects that integrate Vouch.</p></blockquote><p>It also clarifies that someone adept in the skills of manipulation and gaslighting (<em>the technical term is social engineering</em>) won't be able to trick their way into being able to merge a pull request into a repo, as reviewers would have to do that.</p><p>Only people with write access to the project can vouch for or denounce contributors. This also means that <strong>vouched users can't vouch for others</strong>, maintaining a clear hierarchy where maintainers keep full control over who gets access.</p><h2>AI Slop Begone?</h2><p>By now, you must already know that the plague of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop?ref=itsfoss.com">AI slop</a> has reached the shores of open source and maintainers are drowning in it. These AI-generated contributions look okay at first glance, but reviewing and rejecting them takes more time than just writing proper code would have.</p><p>Mitchell says this is a recent problem. Before AI tools took off, <strong>you actually had to understand code to submit a pull request</strong>. That barrier kept out most of the garbage.</p><p>Let me give you an example, <a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/curl-closes-bug-bounty-program/">cURL recently killed its bug bounty program</a> because they got flooded with AI slop. In one week, they got 7 HackerOne reports in just 16 hours.</p><p>The maintainers had enough and decided that removing cash rewards was the only way to stop the flood.</p><p>Vouch tackles the same issue. Instead of reviewing endless junk submissions, maintainers can just build a list of trusted people and only deal with contributions from them.</p><p>Altogether, this is an excellent project.</p>

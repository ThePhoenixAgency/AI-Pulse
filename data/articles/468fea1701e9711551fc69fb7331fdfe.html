    <pre><code>Spidey's going to have his hands full in his next Marvel Cinematic Universe adventure
(Image credit: Sony Pictures/Marvel Entertainment) Sony and Marvel have suffered another Spider-Man: Brand New Day leakNew images have given us our first look at the film's villainsMCU fans aren't enamored with the design of one of the titular hero's foesA new Spider-Man: Brand New Day leak has seemingly revealed the first look at the Sony and Marvel movie's line-up of villains.The images, which have spread like wildfire across the *ahem* web last weekend (February 14/15), appear to show numerous members of the wallcrawler's rogues gallery who'll appear. In somewhat predictable circumstances, fans have expressed their disdain for the design of one of the individuals that Spidey will battle in his next Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) outing, too.Potentially big spoilers immediately follow for Spider-Man 4. Turn back now if you're avoiding them before Brand New Day debuts in theaters on July 31.Which villains are set to appear in Spider-Man 4?New promo for Spider-Man Brand New Day #SpiderManBrandNewDay pic.twitter.com/AkS4MfKrwIFebruary 15, 2026Appearing in a banner, which also seems to reconfirm Bruce Banner/Savage Hulk will show up in the Marvel film, on Brazilian clothing website Piticas, classic and B-list villains in the form of Scorpion, Boomerang, and Tarantula are set to be part of Spider-Man 4's villainous roster. Leaked promo art for the flick, which you can view on X/Twitter, also seems to show Lonnie Lincoln/Tombstone holding Spider-Man aloft in a direct recreation of the front cover for 1988 comic book 'The Spectacular Spider-Man #142'.This isn't the first time that we've heard that these antagonistic individuals are part of proceedings. Last May, another leak indicated three villains would appear in Spider-Man: Brand New Day, with that trio being Tombstone, Mack Gargan/Scorpion, and Fred Myers/Boomerang.Two months later, a behind-the-scenes look at Spider-Man 4 suggested Tarantula, aka the supervillain alias used by five different Marvel characters, would also have a part to play. Then, in September, it was reported that Marvin Jones III would portray Tombstone in Brand New Day. He's expected to be joined by Michael Mando, who should reprise his role as Gargan from 2016 MCU flick Spider-Man: Homecoming.It's the design of Gargan's MCU costume/supersuit/call it what you will that's displeased fans the most since these images came to light, too.Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Threads on the ResetEra forums, r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers, r/MarvelStudios, and r/LeaksandRumors contain comments from disgruntled webheads. Most seem to be upset over the changes made to Scorpion's tail, while others think Manod's Gargan should be sporting the supervillain's helmet and visor.There are a few Spider-Man devotees who are unbothered by the suit tweak, and there's no guarantee that this is the final design of Scorpion's costume. If it is, though, expect it to continue dividing opinion when the film and/or its first trailer are released.Why isn't there a trailer for Spider-Man: Brand New Day yet? Tom Holland's next outing as Peter Parker/Spider-Man hits theaters in mid-2026 (Image credit: Sony Pictures/Marvel Entertainment)Given we're less than six months away from Spider-Man 4 swinging into theaters, it's no surprise that details are emerging about the Marvel Phase 6 movie via merchandise leaks. But, wouldn't it be better to see these characters in action by way of a trailer instead?So, where is it? After all, a low-quality version of Brand New Day's first teaser leaked online last December. A month later, unreliable insider Alex Perez claimed that Spider-Man 4's inaugural trailer would be released "imminently", an event that didn't come to pass. And, most recently, a report indicated Brand New Day's first teaser wouldn't air during this year's Super Bowl, which turned out to be the case.How long, then, is Sony going to make us wait for it? Depending on who you listen to, not long. Speaking to the Who Let Us Out YouTube channel, director Destin Daniel Cretton said "You'll all learn more very soon. It's coming, it's coming."Elsewhere, X/Twitter user Cryptic4Qual, who has a far more reliable track record for scoops, suggested it might arrive sometime in March. If that's true, it's going to be a long month.While we wait, get the full lowdown on everything we know so far about Spider-Man: Brand New Day.

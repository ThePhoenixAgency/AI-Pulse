    <div><div><p> Major Chinese technology companies Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei are pursuing agentic AI (systems that can execute multi-step tasks autonomously and interact with software, data, and services without human instruction), and orienting the technology toward discrete industries and workflows.</p><div><h3>Alibaba’s open-source strategy for agentic AI</h3><div><p> Alibaba’s strategy centres on its <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba%E2%80%99s-qwen-app-advances-agentic-ai-strategy-by-turning-core-ecosystem-services-into-executable-ai-capabilities_602801">Qwen AI model family</a>, a set of large language models with multilingual ability and open-source licences. Its own models are the basis for its AI services and agent platforms offered on Alibaba Cloud. Alibaba Cloud has documented its agent development tooling and vector database services in the open, meaning tools used to build autonomous agents can be adapted by any user.</p><p> It positions the Qwen family as a platform for industry-specific solutions covering finance, logistics, and customer support. The Qwen App, an application built on these models, has reportedly reached a large user base since its public beta, creating links between autonomous tasks and Alibaba’s commerce and payments ecosystem.</p><p> Alibaba open-source portfolio includes an agent framework, Qwen-Agent, to encourage third-party development of autonomous systems. This mirrors a pattern in China’s AI sector where hyperscalers publish frameworks and tools designed to build and manage AI agents, in competition with Western projects like Microsoft’s AutoGen and OpenAI’s Swarm. Tencent has also released an <a href="https://www.chinastrategy.org/2025/09/03/china-advances-in-ai-agentic-tools-as-tencent-bytedance-weigh-in/">open-source agent framework</a>, Youtu-Agent.</p></div></div><div><h3>Tencent, and Huawei’s Pangu: Industry-specific AI</h3><div><p> Huawei uses a combination of model development, infrastructure, and industry-specific agent frameworks to attract users to join its worldwide market. Its Huawei Cloud division has developed a ‘supernode’ architecture for enterprise agentic AI workloads that supports large cognitive models and the workflow orchestration agentic AI requires. AI agents are embedded in the foundation models of the Pangu family, which comprise of hardware stacks tuned for telecommunications, utilities, creative, and industrial applications, among other verticals. Early deployments are reported in sectors such as network optimisation, manufacturing and energy, where agents can plan tasks like predictive maintenance and resource allocation with minimal human oversight.</p><p> Tencent Cloud’s “scenario-based AI” suite is a set of tools and SaaS-style applications that enterprises outside China can access, although the company’s cloud footprint remains smaller than Western hyperscalers in many regions.</p><p> Despite these investments, real-world Chinese agentic AI platforms have been most visible inside China. Projects such as OpenClaw, originally created outside the ecosystem, have been integrated into workplace environments like Alibaba’s DingTalk and Tencent’s WeCom and used to automate scheduling, create code, and manage developer workflows. These integrations are widely <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openclaw-moltbot-china-internet-alibaba-bytedance-tencent-rednote-ai-agent-2026-2">discussed in Chinese developer communities</a> but are not yet established in the enterprise environments of the major economic nations.</p></div></div><div><h3>Availability in Western markets</h3><div><p> Alibaba Cloud operates international data centres and markets AI services to European and Asian customers, positioning itself as a competitor to AWS and Azure for AI workloads. Huawei also markets cloud and AI infrastructure internationally, with a focus on telecommunications and regulated industries. In practice, however, uptake in Western enterprises remains limited compared with adoption of Western-origin AI platforms. This can be attributed to geopolitical concerns, data governance restrictions, and differences in enterprise ecosystems that favour local cloud providers. In AI developer workflows, for example, NVIDIA’s CUDA SHALAR remains dominant, and migration to the frameworks and methods of an alternative come with high up-front costs in the form of re-training.</p><p> There is also a hardware constraint: Chinese hyperscalers to work inside limits placed on them by their restricted access to Western GPUs for training and inference workloads, often using domestically produced processors or locating some workloads in overseas data centres to secure advanced hardware.</p><p> The models themselves, particularly Qwen, are however at least accessible to developers through standard model hubs and APIs under open licences for many variants. This means Western companies and research institutions can experiment with those models irrespective of cloud provider selection.</p></div></div><div><h3>Conclusion</h3><div><p> Chinese hyperscalers have defined a distinct trajectory for agentic AI, combining language models with frameworks and infrastructure tailored for autonomous operation in commercial contexts. Alibaba, Tencent and Huawei aim to embed these systems into enterprise pipelines and consumer ecosystems, offering tools that can operate with a degree of autonomy.</p><p> These offerings are accessible in the West markets but have not yet achieved the same level of enterprise penetration on mainland European and US soil. To find more common uses of Chinese-flavoured agentic AI, we need to look to the Middle and Far East, South America, and Africa, where Chinese influence is stronger.</p><p><em>(Image source: “China Science &amp; Technology Museum, Beijing, April-2011” by maltman23 is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0.)</em></p><p><a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series"><img src="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png" /></a></p><p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href="https://www.ai-expo.net/">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

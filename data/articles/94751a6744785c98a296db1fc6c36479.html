  <div class="content"><p>Nexo re-enters the U.S. market three years after exiting due to regulatory issuesThe digital assets wealth platform’s rollout includes regulated yield accounts, credit lines and exchange access backed by Bakkt.
Updated Feb 16, 2026, 3:06 p.m. Published Feb 16, 2026, 2:30 p.m. Nexo is set to return to the U.S. market, saying it has officially rolled-out a suite of digital asset offerings and trading infrastructure from the U.S.-based Bakkt.The digital asset wealth platform withdrew from the U.S. in late 2022 after what it called a "dead end" in negotiations with state and federal regulators over its Earn Interest Product. The company said in 2022 it could no longer operate in an "impossible environment" following multiple enforcement actions, including from California and New York. However, in April 2025, it announced it would return, adding had $11 billion in assets under management.STORY CONTINUES BELOWThe company’s U.S. product lineup includes fixed and flexible yield programs, an integrated crypto exchange, and crypto-backed credit lines. These services are offered through a compliant framework designed to support portfolio management and liquidity access for retail and institutional clients. Fiat on- and off-ramps are available via automated clearing house (ACH) and wire transfers.The re-entry to the U.S. follows what the company called a “period of deliberate recalibration,” signaling a longer-term commitment to regulated markets. Nexo says the move also follows its “ongoing global expansion.” Nexo cited $371 billion in global transactions processed to date, in Monday's statement.The firm’s broader expansion includes the acquisition of Argentina’s Buenbit and sponsorships with the ATP Dallas Open and the Audi Revolut F1 Team.More For YouFrom Wall Street to Web3: This is crypto’s year of integration, Silicon Valley Bank says7 hours agoFrom bank-led stablecoins to tokenized T-bills and AI-powered wallets, digital assets will move from pilot projects to financial plumbing this year.What to know: Silicon Valley Bank's Anthony Vassallo says institutional adoption of crypto is accelerating, pushing bigger venture capital checks, more bank-led custody and lending, and deeper M&amp;A consolidation.Stablecoins are emerging as the “internet’s dollar,” fueled by clearer regulation and enterprise demand for payments and settlement.Tokenized real-world assets and AI-driven crypto applications are shifting blockchain from speculation to core infrastructure, the bank said.Read full story</p></div>

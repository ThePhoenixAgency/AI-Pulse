A copy of the letter can be <a href="http://insidermonkey.com/blog/wasatch-global-investors-small-cap-growth-strategys-q4-2025-letter-1682242/" target="_blank"><strong>downloaded here</strong></a>. The Wasatch Small Cap Growth Strategy experienced a challenging fourth quarter as small-cap equities lagged broader market indices, reflecting investor caution and a continued preference for larger, more liquid stocks. During the period, the Russell 2000® Growth Index gained 1.22%, while the strategy finished the quarter in negative territory, with performance driven by stock-specific factors rather than macroeconomic stress. Results contrasted with strength in select areas of the small-cap market, as biotechnology emerged as one of the strongest segments, with the biotech component of the Russell 2000® Growth Index rising nearly 27%. For the 2025 calendar year, the Russell 2000 Growth Index advanced 13.01%, while the strategy posted a loss, highlighting the impact of earnings volatility and valuation compression across several holdings despite management citing improving fundamentals and easing financial conditions as potential longer-term supports.

(NASDAQ:<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VITL">VITL</a>). Vital Farms, Inc. (NASDAQ:VITL) is a branded food company focused on ethically produced pasture-raised eggs and butter, leveraging a differentiated supply chain and premium positioning in U.S. grocery channels. The one-month return of Vital Farms, Inc. (NASDAQ:VITL) was -4.94% while its shares traded between $25.51 and $53.13 over the last 52 weeks. On February 13, 2026, Vital Farms, Inc. (NASDAQ:VITL) stock closed at approximately $28.41 per share, with a market capitalization of about $1.27 billion.</p>   <p>Wasatch Global Investors stated the following regarding Vital Farms, Inc. (NASDAQ:VITL) in its Q4 2025 investor letter:</p>    <blockquote><p>"Another large detractor was <strong>Vital Farms, Inc. (NASDAQ:VITL)</strong>. The company produces and distributes eggs and butter from pasture-raised chickens and cows, emphasizing ethical sourcing and transparency. The stock likely fell due to the drop in egg prices in recent months. Back when egg prices were higher, Vital gained market share by maintaining a relatively steady price for its eggs when other producers raised prices. With prices now falling, some investors were likely concerned that Vital could lose a little share. We believe these concerns are overdone. We think many customers will continue to purchase Vital’s eggs, due to their preference for pasture-raised and ethically sourced food products. Additionally, we believe investors are overlooking the potential for Vital to improve margins as some costs associated with egg production come down."</p> </blockquote>  </div></div> <span> </span>  </article>      <section><header> </header>  <div><ul> <p>Weʼre unable to load stories right now.</p>  </ul></div> </section></div>        </main> </div></div>

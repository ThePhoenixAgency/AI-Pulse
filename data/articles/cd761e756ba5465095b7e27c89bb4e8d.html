    <div><div> <p><img alt="Password management" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2021/09/08/PasswordManagement.jpg"></p> <p>One morning, you wake up and realize that your business has grown to the point where you can no longer afford to get into that old, worn-out diesel subcompact. Instead, you schedule a test drive of a brand-new electric vehicle. The business transitioning from password-based security to passkey technology experiences a similarly transformative feeling. Now, let's dive into the details and break it down thoroughly!</p> <p>Passwords have powered digital authentication for decades — much like an old diesel subcompact that somehow keeps starting every morning. But the engine is coughing. The doors don't lock properly. Anyone who knows the trick can jiggle the handle and get in.</p> <p>Research shows that<a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2023-data-breach-investigations-report-dbir.pdf"> 49% of security incidents involve compromised passwords</a>, according to Verizon's 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, while 84% of users admit to reusing the same password across multiple accounts — creating a cascade of vulnerabilities. These are not minor inconveniences — they are warning lights flashing on the dashboard, signaling systemic risk.</p> <p>Passwordless authentication, particularly through passkeys, is like upgrading to a high-tech bullet car: faster, sleeker, and nearly impossible to derail. The ride is smoother, quieter, and significantly harder to hijack.</p> <p>For organizations under ISO/IEC 27001, switching from passwords to passkeys is less like a casual upgrade and more like overhauling an entire airline fleet to meet stringent new safety standards. It requires ensuring that the new drivetrain aligns with established controls, risk treatment plans, and documentation obligations.</p> <p>This article examines how organizations can transition to passkeys while maintaining ISO/IEC 27001 compliance — covering the technical foundations and offering practical guidance for IT professionals navigating this modernization journey.</p> <h2>How passwordless authentication works: Technical foundations</h2> <p>Passwordless authentication eliminates the cognitive burden of remembering passwords. Authentication relies on cryptographic keys, biometrics, or possession-based factors — what you have or what you are.</p> <p>Passkeys represent the most mature implementation of this approach. Passkeys, built on FIDO2 and WebAuthn standards, are like the latest GPS technology — they guide you securely to your destination without the risk of getting lost or taking a wrong turn.</p> <p>When you create a passkey, your device generates a cryptographic key pair: a private key that stays locked on your device, and a public key that's registered with the service. During authentication, the service sends a challenge, your device signs it with the private key, and the service verifies the signature. Because the private key never leaves your device, attackers have nothing to intercept or phish.</p> <p><a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/">NIST's Digital Identity Guidelines (SP 800-63B)</a> classify authentication methods by Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). Passkeys typically meet AAL2 or AAL3 requirements, representing a significant security upgrade over traditional password-based authentication.</p> <p>Modern passkeys come in two flavors: device-bound (stored in hardware like security keys) and syncable (backed up across devices through encrypted cloud services). NIST's updated guidance from August 2024 explicitly addresses syncable authenticators, recognizing that users who lose their only authentication method face significant access recovery challenges.</p> <p>The adoption numbers tell a compelling story.<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkey-adoption-doubles-in-2024-more-than-15-billion-online-accounts-can-leverage-passkeys/"> FIDO Alliance reports that more than 15 billion online accounts now support passkeys</a> — double the figure from 2023. Amazon has created 175 million passkeys, while<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkey-adoption-doubles-in-2024-more-than-15-billion-online-accounts-can-leverage-passkeys/"> Google reports 800 million accounts with passkeys enabled</a>. The revolution is already underway.</p>

The 2022 revision reorganized Annex A controls into four themes: organizational, people, physical, and technological.</p> <p>Authentication falls primarily under three controls:</p> <ul><li> <p><strong>Annex A 5.15 (Access Control)</strong> defines rules and rights for accessing information and systems. Organizations must establish policies covering user authentication, authorization, access provisioning, and access revocation procedures.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Annex A 5.17 (Authentication Information)</strong> requires organization-wide procedures for allocating and managing authentication credentials, including documenting authentication methods and protecting authentication data.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Annex A 8.5 (Secure Authentication)</strong> specifies technical implementation requirements, including multi-factor authentication for privileged access.</p> </li>
</ul><p>For organizations with ISO/IEC 27001 certification, adopting passkeys requires demonstrating that the new authentication method meets or exceeds existing control objectives, that risks have been properly assessed, and that implementation is thoroughly documented.</p> <h2>Mapping passwordless adoption to ISO/IEC 27001 controls</h2> <p>Transitioning to passkeys touches multiple ISO/IEC 27001 controls. Here's how to align your implementation:</p> <p><strong>A 5.15 (Access Control)</strong></p> <ul><li> <p>Define passkey scope by risk level: device-bound passkeys for privileged accounts (AAL3), syncable passkeys for standard users (AAL2)</p> </li> <li> <p>Document fallback procedures for device loss scenarios</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish clear policies for when and how users can authenticate without passkeys during transition periods</p> </li>
</ul><p><strong>A 5.17 (Authentication Information)</strong></p> <ul><li> <p>Document the complete enrollment process, including who initiates registration and what identity verification steps are required</p> </li> <li> <p>Define encryption requirements for databases storing public keys</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify re-enrollment triggers: device compromise, security incidents, device loss, or role changes</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish access controls for authentication data management</p> </li>
</ul><p><strong>A 8.5 (Secure Authentication)</strong></p> <ul><li> <p>Demonstrate MFA compliance by documenting how passkeys provide two factors: possession (the device) plus biometrics or device PIN</p> </li> <li> <p>Explain how cryptographic binding to specific domains prevents use on phishing sites</p> </li> <li> <p>Detail technical implementation of WebAuthn protocols and FIDO2 standards</p> </li>
</ul><p><strong>Risk assessment and treatment</strong></p> <ul><li> <p>Document eliminated risks: credential theft through phishing, password reuse across services, brute force attacks, credential stuffing</p> </li> <li> <p>Address new risks: device loss or theft, vendor lock-in with syncable passkeys, recovery complexity, downgrade attacks where attackers manipulate interfaces to force fallback authentication</p> </li> <li> <p>Establish monitoring procedures for detecting and responding to new attack vectors</p> </li>
</ul><p>Organizations should prioritize device-bound passkeys (AAL3) for privileged accounts and syncable passkeys (AAL2) for standard users. Document fallback procedures, encryption standards, and re-enrollment triggers to satisfy auditor requirements.</p> <h2>Benefits of passkeys</h2> <p>Real-world implementation data reveals benefits beyond theoretical threat modeling. Google reports that passkeys eliminate password-based attacks entirely for accounts that use them exclusively, with a 30% improvement in authentication success rates and 20% faster sign-in times.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authsignal.com/blog/articles/world-passkey-day-the-state-of-passkeys-in-2025">Sony PlayStation observed an 88% conversion rate for users who started enrollment</a>.</p> </div></div>

I was sitting down and I fell on the floor, along with the other passengers," one man told Ansa news agency. "It was terrible."</p></div><div><p>As it left the track, the tram apparently first hit a traffic light before smashing the window of a restaurant. A delivery rider waiting at the traffic light and a young man on a pavement narrowly escaped injury, La Repubblica website reported.</p></div><div><p>"I got on at the first stop, [Piazza della] Repubblica," one female passenger told Corriere della Sera. "I was standing next to the driver, and they all crashed into me."</p></div><div><p>"I just heard an enormous bang," said 27-year-old Anna, who was in an office nearby, quoted by AFP.

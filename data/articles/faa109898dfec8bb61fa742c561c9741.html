  <h1>Drones to Diplomas: How Russia’s Largest Private University is Linked to a $25M Essay Mill</h1>
  
<p>Mr. Lobov was one of 11 individuals <a href="https://archive.ph/HJIwe" target="_blank">reportedly hand-picked</a> by the convicted Russian spy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Butina" target="_blank">Marina Butina</a> to attend the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast held in Washington D.C. just two weeks after President Trump’s first inauguration.</p>
<p>While Synergy University promotes itself as Russia’s largest private educational institution, hundreds of international students tell a different story. Online reviews from students paint a picture of unkept promises: Prospective students from Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and other nations paying thousands in advance fees for promised study visas to Russia, only to have their applications denied with no refunds offered.</p>
<p>“My experience with Synergy University has been nothing short of heartbreaking,” reads one such account. “When I first discovered the school, their representative was extremely responsive and eager to assist. He communicated frequently and made me believe I was in safe hands. However, after paying my hard-earned tuition fees, my visa was denied. It’s been over 9 months since that denial, and despite their promises, I have received no refund whatsoever. My messages are now ignored, and the same representative who once replied instantly no longer responds at all. Synergy University, how can an institution in Europe feel comfortable exploiting the hopes of Africans who trust you with their life savings? This is not just unethical — it’s predatory.”</p>
<p>This pattern repeats across reviews by multilingual students from Pakistan, Nepal, India, and various African nations — all describing the same scheme: Attractive online marketing, promises of easy visa approval, upfront payment requirements, and then silence after visa denials.</p>
<p>Reddit discussions in r/Moscow and r/AskARussian are filled with warnings. “It’s a scam, a diploma mill,” writes one user. “They literally sell exams. There was an investigation on Rossiya-1 television showing students paying to pass tests.”</p>
<p>The Nerdify website’s “About Us” page says the company was co-founded by Pokatilo and an American named <strong>Brian Mellor</strong>. The latter identity seems to have been fabricated, or at least there is no evidence that a person with this name ever worked at Nerdify.</p>
<p>Rather, it appears that the SMS assistance company co-founded by Messrs. Pokatilo and Perkon (Awesome Technologies) fizzled out shortly after its creation, and that Nerdify soon adopted the process of accepting assignment requests via text message and routing them to freelance writers.</p>
<p>A closer look at an early “About Us” page for Nerdify in The Wayback Machine suggests that Mr. Perkon was the real co-founder of the company: The photo at the top of the page shows four people wearing Nerdify T-shirts seated around a table on a rooftop deck in San Francisco, and the man facing the camera is Perkon.</p>

<p>Where are they now? <span>Pokatilo is currently running a startup called </span><a href="http://litero.ai/"><span>Litero.Ai</span></a>, which appears to be an AI-based essay writing service. In July 2025, Mr. Pokatilo received pre-seed funding of $800,000 for Litero from an investment program backed by the venture capital firms AltaIR Capital, Yellow Rocks, Smart Partnership Capital, and I2BF Global Ventures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Filip Perkon is busy setting up <a href="https://www.kron4.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/795612469/not-just-hot-air-worlds-largest-solid-rubber-duck-sculpture-installed-in-miami-beach-fl/" target="_blank">toy rubber duck stores in Miami</a> and in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/23/how-londons-rubber-duck-stores-stay-above-water.html" target="_blank">at least three locations in the United Kingdom</a>. These “Duck World” shops market themselves as “the world’s largest duck store.”</p>
<p>This past week, Mr. Lobov <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/who-is-natalia-popova-and-whats-her-message-as-russian-education-launches-in-india/articleshow/125787431.cms" target="_blank">was in India with Putin’s entourage</a> on a charm tour with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although Synergy is billed as an educational institution, a review of the company’s sprawling corporate footprint (via DNS) shows it also is assisting the Russian government in its war against Ukraine.</p>

<p>The website <strong>bpla.s</strong><strong>ynergy[.]bot</strong>, for instance, says the company is involved in developing combat drones to aid Russian forces and to evade international sanctions on the supply and re-export of high-tech products.</p>

<p>KrebsOnSecurity would like to thank the anonymous researcher <a href="https://natinfosec.com/" target="_blank">NatInfoSec</a> for their assistance in this investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Update, Dec. 8, 10:06 a.m. ET:</strong> Mr. Pokatilo responded to requests for comment after the publication of this story. Pokatilo said he has no relation to Synergy nor to Mr. Lobov, and that his work with Mr. Perkon ended with the dissolution of Awesome Technologies.</p>
<p>“I have had no involvement in any of his projects and business activities mentioned in the article and he has no involvement in Litero.ai,” Pokatilo said of Perkon.</p>
<p>Mr. Pokatilo said his new company Litero “does not provide contract cheating services and is built specifically to improve transparency and academic integrity in the age of universal use of AI by students.”</p>
<p>“I am Ukrainian,” he said in an email. “My close friends, colleagues, and some family members continue to live in Ukraine under the ongoing invasion. Any suggestion that I or my company may be connected in any way to Russia’s war efforts is deeply offensive on a personal level and harmful to the reputation of Litero.ai, a company where many team members are Ukrainian.”</p>
<p><strong>Update, Dec. 11, 12:07 p.m. ET:</strong> Mr. Perkon responded to requests for comment after the publication of this story. Perkon said the photo of him in a Nerdify T-shirt (see screenshot above) was taken after a startup event in San Francisco, where he volunteered to act as a photo model to help friends with their project. </p>
<p>“I have no business or other relations to Nerdify or any other ventures in that space,” Mr. Perkon said in an email response. “As for Vadim Lobov, I worked for Venture Capital arm at Synergy until 2013 as well as his business school project in the UK, that didn’t get off the ground, so the company related to this was made dormant. Then Synergy kindly provided sponsorship for my Russian Film Week event that I created and ran until 2022 in the U.K., an event that became the biggest independent Russian film festival outside of Russia. Since the start of the Ukraine war in 2022 I closed the festival down.” </p>
<p>“I have had no business with Vadim Lobov since 2021 (the last film festival) and I don’t keep track of his endeavours,” Perkon continued. “As for Alexey Pokatilo, we are university friends. Our business relationship has ended after the concierge service Awesome Technologies didn’t work out, many years ago.”</p>

The North Carolina plant will employ more than 150 people and will assume production of next-generation excavators previously manufactured in Japan, marking a shift of that production to the U.S.</p>      <p>The excavator factory is part of Deere’s broader commitment to invest $20 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next decade, the company said.</p>      <p>Radar platform company <a href="https://www.echodyne.com/resources/news-events/echodyne-manufacturing-facility/" target="_blank">Echodyne</a> is investing $40 million in a new 86,350-square-foot manufacturing facility in Kirkland, Washington.</p>   <p>The new plant is designed to produce and ship more than 30,000 radars annually across product lines. The company said it expects to employ more than 200 workers when the facility reaches full capacity, with production scheduled to begin in summer 2026.</p>   <p>The expansion comes amid growing global demand for counter-drone, border security and defense-related radar technologies.</p>         <p>In Sugar Land, Texas, <a href="https://investors.ao-inc.com/news-releases/news-release-details/applied-optoelectronics-breaks-ground-planned-manufacturing" target="_blank">Applied Optoelectronics Inc.</a> (AOI) broke ground on a 210,000-square-foot manufacturing facility that will support production of optical networking products for AI data centers and broadband networks.</p>   <p>AOI said it plans to increase its total investment in the project and headquarters campus from $150 million to potentially $300 million by the end of next year. The company has committed to creating 500 local jobs tied to automated production lines.</p>   <p>Executives positioned the expansion as part of Texas’ broader push to become a leader in artificial intelligence infrastructure manufacturing.</p>          <p>Sanko Texas Corp., a subsidiary of a Japanese plastics manufacturer, plans to build a nearly $40 million plant on a 43.7-acre site in San Antonio.</p>  </div></div> <span> </span>  </article>      <section><header> </header>  <div><ul> <p>Weʼre unable to load stories right now.</p>  </ul></div> </section></div></div>

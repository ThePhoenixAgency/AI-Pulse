    <div><div><p>A son of the late Zimbabwean president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/robert-mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a> has been charged with attempted murder after a 23-year-old man was allegedly shot in the back on 19 February in an upmarket area of Johannesburg.</p><p>Bellarmine Chatunga Mugabe, 28, appeared in court on Monday for a brief hearing alongside co-accused Tobias Mugabe Matonhodze. Mugabe’s lawyer Sinenhlanhla Mnguni declined to comment when <a href="https://www.enca.com/news-top-stories/mugabes-son-makes-first-court-appearance-shooting">asked by reporters</a> whether the two men were related. Mnguni said he would request bail for his clients at the next hearing on 3 March.</p><p>Mugabe and his older brother Robert Junior became notorious in the 2010s for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/17/robert-grace-mugabe-missing-millions-money-zimababwe">sharing their lavish lifestyles</a> online. In 2017, the younger Mugabe posted a photograph of his watch on Instagram with the caption: “$60,000 on the wrist when your daddy run the whole country ya know!!!” Shortly after, a video circulated of him <a href="https://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/watch-mugabe-son-pours-champagne-over-his-expensive-watch-as-he-parties-in-sandton-20171108">dousing the watch</a> with champagne.</p><p>A state prosecutor said at the hearing on Monday that the gun allegedly used in the shooting had not yet been found. He added that investigations were “far from over”.</p><p>Mugabe and Matonhodze, 33, have also been charged with obstructing justice, illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, contraventions of the Immigration Act on suspicion of being in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica">South Africa</a> illegally, and theft, said Magaboke Mohlatlole, a national prosecuting authority spokesperson.</p><p>Regarding the theft charge, Mohlatlole said: “After [the alleged victim] got shot, he tried to flee. He went outside of the gate and then he fell. After falling, one of the accused went and took the remote [for the gate] from him.”</p><p>The man who was shot is still in hospital and is being watched over by police, a police spokesperson, Dimakatso Nevhuhulwi, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk1fY-eSVas">told</a> the national broadcaster SABC before the hearing. When the men were arrested, police said they believed the victim was an employee at the house in Hyde Park, a plush suburb where South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, also has a home.</p><p>Robert Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe for almost 40 years until he was deposed in a coup in 2017. He died two years later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/06/robert-mugabe-former-zimbabwean-president-dies-aged-95">aged 95</a>.</p><p>He came to power as a hero, having ended white minority rule in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>. However, his rule turned to tyranny and corruption and he presided over hyperinflation and economic collapse.</p><p>His widow, Grace Mugabe, who was 40 years his junior, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/15/grace-mugabe-the-rags-to-riches-rise-and-fall-of-gucci-grace">notorious for her expensive taste</a>. Reported property purchases in Johannesburg, Singapore, Dubai and Malaysia, and a rumoured £75,000 shopping spree in Paris, earned her the nickname “Gucci Grace”.</p><p>She avoided a court case in South Africa in 2017 by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/19/south-africa-grants-grace-mugabe-diplomatic-immunity-report">invoking diplomatic immunity</a>. The model Gabriella Engels accused the former first lady of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/15/zimbabwe-first-lady-accused-attacking-woman-staying-grace-mugabe-sons">hitting her with an electric cable</a> until she bled after she went to meet the Mugabe brothers at a hotel. Grace <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/grace-mugabe-self-defence-hotel-incident-gabriella-engels">denied the allegations</a>.</p><p>In 2023, Robert Junior was arrested for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/20/robert-mugabes-son-charged-in-zimbabwe-for-damaging-cars-at-party">allegedly causing £10,000 of damage</a> to cars and other property at a party in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. Last year, <a href="https://www.news24.com/politics/robert-mugabes-son-sentenced-for-drug-possession-20251113-0916">he was fined</a> for possessing cannabis after being arrested while driving the wrong way down a one-way street.</p></div></div>

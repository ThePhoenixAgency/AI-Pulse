A copy of the letter can be <a href="http://insidermonkey.com/blog/wasatch-global-investors-small-cap-growth-strategys-q4-2025-letter-1682242/" target="_blank"><strong>downloaded here</strong></a>. The Wasatch Small Cap Growth Strategy experienced a challenging fourth quarter as small-cap equities lagged broader market indices, reflecting investor caution and a continued preference for larger, more liquid stocks. During the period, the Russell 2000® Growth Index gained 1.22%, while the strategy finished the quarter in negative territory, with performance driven by stock-specific factors rather than macroeconomic stress. Results contrasted with strength in select areas of the small-cap market, as biotechnology emerged as one of the strongest segments, with the biotech component of the Russell 2000® Growth Index rising nearly 27%. For the 2025 calendar year, the Russell 2000 Growth Index advanced 13.01%, while the strategy posted a loss, highlighting the impact of earnings volatility and valuation compression across several holdings despite management citing improving fundamentals and easing financial conditions as potential longer-term supports.

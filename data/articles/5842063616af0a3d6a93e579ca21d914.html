One of the reported options was for Iran to be allowed to enrich uranium at a minimal level after a three-to-five-year suspension, under international monitoring.</p></div><div><p>In return for a deal, Araghchi told Iranian television that the negotiators demanded the lifting of sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. </p></div><div><p>Opponents of the regime say any relief would give the clerical rulers a lifeline.</p></div><div><p>The indirect talks happened in two sessions. One in the morning, that lasted three hours, and another, shorter, in the evening. There was no immediate US reaction on the outcome.</p></div><div><p>As in previous rounds, the US was represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Rafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), also joined the negotiations.</p></div><div><p>It remains unclear which conditions Trump could find acceptable for a deal, and the president has done little to explain why there could be the need to take military action now, eight months after the US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities during a war between Israel and Iran.</p></div><div><p>Iran has already rejected discussing limits to the country's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for proxies in the region, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, militias in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a0f/live/fdfed7d0-1304-11f1-801d-ed3cff6bf876.jpg.webp" alt="Reuters The USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier leaves Souda Bay, Crete, Greece (26 February 2026)"><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, left Souda Bay in Crete on Thursday</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>In recent weeks, the US has sent thousands of troops and what Trump has described as an "armada" to the region, including two aircraft carriers along with other warships, as well as fighter jets and refuelling aircraft.</p></div><div><p>Trump first threatened to bomb Iran last month as security forces brutally repressed anti-government protests, killing thousands of people. But since then, his focus has turned to Iran's nuclear programme, which has been at the centre of a long-running dispute with the West.</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8a98/live/e50f71a0-12f8-11f1-89c0-597e6cfce3ac.jpg.webp" alt="AFP Swiss police officers stand by as a convoy arrives at the Omani ambassador residence for new round of indirect talks between the United States and Iran, in Geneva, Switzerland (26 February 2026)"><span>AFP</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The indirect talks are taking place at the Omani ambassador's residence in Geneva</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>He said Iran was working to build missiles that would "soon" be capable of reaching the US, without giving details. He also accused the country of trying to "start all over again" with a nuclear weapons programme following last year's strikes, and said he could not allow the "world's number one sponsor of terror... to have a nuclear weapon".</p></div><div><p>Hours before the speech, however, the Iranian foreign minister posted on social media that Iran would "under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon".</p></div><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260220-084609-e0c5de56b9-web-2.40.1-3/grey-placeholder.png"><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8cd0/live/9f729a30-1269-11f1-b048-c9424b2cf5fd.jpg.webp" alt="Reuters Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi addresses a special session of a conference on disarmament at the United Nations, in Geneva, Switzerland (17 February 2026)"><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says Iran "will under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon"</figcaption><p></p></figure></div><div><p>At the time, Trump said the facilities had been "obliterated". Iran says its enrichment activity stopped after the attacks, although it has not allowed the IAEA inspectors to access the damaged sites.</p></div><div><p>Reports in US media, quoting unnamed administration officials, have suggested that Trump was considering an initial strike in the coming days on Iran's Revolutionary Guards or nuclear sites to pressure the country's leaders. </p></div><div><p>If negotiations failed, according to the reports, the president might go as far as ordering a campaign with the aim of toppling Iranian Supreme Leader, <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2ygl4lpl1o">Ayatollah Ali Khamene</a>i.</p></div><div><p>The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is also said to have warned that strikes against Iran could be risky, potentially drawing the US into a prolonged conflict, although Trump has insisted that Gen Dan Caine believes it would be "easily won".</p></div><div><p>Iran, meanwhile, has threatened to respond to any attack by striking American military assets in the Middle East and Israel.</p></div><div><p>US-allied countries in the region are concerned that an attack on Iran could lead to a wider conflict, and have warned air power alone will not be able to change the country's leadership.</p></div><div><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, has warned against a deal that does not include Iran's ballistic missiles and its proxies. </p></div><div><p>Netanyahu has long described Iran as a key threat for Israel, and a source of instability in the region.</p></div><div><p>Analysts believe that the prime minister, who visited the White House earlier this month, may be pushing for a campaign with the goal of toppling the Iranian regime.</p></div><div><p>The US has the world's second-largest nuclear arsenal. Israel is also believed to have nuclear weapons, although it neither confirms nor denies this.</p></div></article></div></div>

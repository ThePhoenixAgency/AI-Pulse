    <div><div> <p>The <a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/france/">French </a>government said on Sunday it was tightening checks on several <a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/food/">food</a> ⁠imports in a bid to ease concerns of farmers who have been protesting at what they say is unfair competition from countries with looser regulations.</p> <p><a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251219-french-government-warns-farmers-against-christmas-blockades-over-cattle-cull">French farmers have been protesting</a> over a ​planned European trade deal with the South American <a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/mercosur/">Mercosur</a> bloc, and other issues including measures to contain a livestock disease.</p> <p>Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard said the tighter checks would make sure food coming from ​outside the EU did not include substances banned in food produced in ​the bloc.</p> <p>A decree would be issued soon announcing the suspension of imports of some food products already known to contain those substances, she added.</p> <p>"Imports, regardless of from where they come in the world, must comply with our standards. France is setting an example in Europe by issuing this unprecedented decree that concerns more than a dozen food products," wrote Genevard on X.</p> <p><span>Watch more</span><a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/talking-europe/20251219-we-cannot-accept-an-enormous-gap-in-standards-between-eu-and-mercosur-copa-cogeca-s-tsiforou">'We cannot accept an enormous gap in standards between EU and Mercosur': COPA-COGECA's Tsiforou</a></p> <p>"Melons, apples, apricots, cherries, strawberries, grapes, potatoes: they will only be on sale in France if they show no residue of these substances banned in our ​country. Other products from <a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/south-america/">South America</a> such as avocados, mangos, guavas, or certain citrus fruits from elsewhere will only be allowed in if they comply with our standards," she added.</p> <p>Prime ‌Minister <a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tag/s%C3%A9bastien-lecornu/">Sébastien Lecornu</a> said earlier that any imported product showing traces of these weed and fungus killers –&nbsp;namely mancozeb, glufosinate, thiophanate-methyl, and carbendazim which are banned in Europe – will not be allowed in France.</p> <p><span>Watch more</span><a target="_self" href="https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/people-profit/20251219-sacrificing-agriculture-for-trade-mercosur-deal-divides-european-union">Sacrificing agriculture for trade?

It is up to the European Commission to make ‌sure this is generalised ​across the board. If necessary, we will do it again," added Genevard.</p> <p><em>(FRANCE 24 with Reuters)</em></p> </div></div>

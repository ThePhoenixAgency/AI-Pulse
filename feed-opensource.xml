      <description><![CDATA[Let’s be real: Crypto mining today is boring. Unless you have a warehouse full of noisy ASICs in a country with near-zero electricity costs, you’re basically priced out. It’s become an industrial game for the 1%, leaving the rest of us hobbyists with nothing but expensive electricity bills and empty wallets.
But then I stumbled upon RustChain, and for the first time in years, I’m actually excited about a consensus mechanism. They call it Proof-of-Antiquity (PoA). It’s weird, it’s nostalgic, and it might just be the most "human" approach to blockchain I’ve seen.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[TL;DR: We deleted 310 lines of template middleware by switching to native Accord Project TemplateMark grammar. Zero regressions.
Our legal agreement templates needed to render in the browser. We had a translation layer converting TemplateMark grammar into an intermediate format — 310 lines of middleware that existed for no good reason.
TemplateMark already has a formal grammar. We were translating to an intermediate format unnecessarily.
// Before: translate TemplateMark -&gt; intermediate -&gt; render
const intermediate = translateTemplate(templateMark);]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The pulperia works because the woman behind the bar is the owner.
This is important. Not in a sentimental way, not in a "support small business" way, but in the structural way that determines whether the polvo is good or not. She decides the menu. She knows the regulars. She pours the ribeiro the way it should be poured, which is to say generously, into ceramic cups that don't match, without asking if you'd prefer something else. There is nothing else. This is the pulperia.
Her name is — well, it doesn't matter. Let's call her Carme. Carme has been running this place for twenty-two years.]]></description>

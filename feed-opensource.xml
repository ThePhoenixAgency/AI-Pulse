      <description><![CDATA[There are 200+ MCP servers on npm right now. Thousands of LangChain tools. Hundreds of CrewAI skills.
And no single place to publish, discover, and install them.
We're changing that. ClawList Plugin Registry is now in early access — and we're looking for the Founding 10 plugins to launch with.
You build a great tool — a weather lookup, a code analyzer, a database connector. You publish it to npm or PyPI. And then... nothing. It disappears into the void.
Why? Because there's no dedicated registry for AI agent plugins. No search engine that understands tool schemas.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Hey everyone Curious how folks here are handling compute for AI workloads in practice.
If you’re working with LLMs, vision models, speech pipelines, or even smaller experiments, you’ve probably hit the compute wall at some point. Buying GPUs is expensive and not always easy to scale, while managed APIs can limit flexibility and control. So here’s the question:
Would you rent a GPU (bare metal or virtual) to run your own AI models?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Configuration DSL: making the gem flexible A gem that can't adapt to its host app will never leave your own repo.
This is part 3 of the series where we build DataPorter, a mountable Rails engine for data import workflows. In part 1, we established the problem and architecture. Part 2 covered scaffolding the engine gem with isolate_namespace.
In this article, we'll build the configuration layer: a clean DSL that lets host apps customize DataPorter's behavior through an initializer. By the end, you'll have a DataPorter.configure block that feels like any well-designed Rails gem.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[ArrayList: The Dynamic Array An ArrayList is like a dynamic array. It stores elements by their index, so you can quickly jump to any element you want. It can hold all sorts of elements, even null, and it’s totally fine with duplicates.
Some operations in an ArrayList are super fast and take the same amount of time no matter how many elements you've got. These include set, get, iterator, ListIterator, isEmpty, and size.
Think of an ArrayList like a resizable array.
It stores elements in a contiguous block of memory (like seats in a theater).]]></description>

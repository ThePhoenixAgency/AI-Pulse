      <description><![CDATA[AI coding tools are fast. They're also confidently wrong about your team's conventions.
You migrate off moment.js. Cursor adds it back. You build a repository layer. Copilot writes db.select() directly in page.tsx. You ship a design system with a component. Claude writes a custom with inline Tailwind. You ban axios. An AI assistant adds it to package.json.
They generate from training data, not from your architecture. And the legacy patterns in your codebase are the ones they see most -- so they reinforce them.
I kept seeing this across teams and decided to build something to fix it.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[When I ask my AI coding agent to set up webhooks from a new API (Stripe, Shopify, GitHub, whatever), the code it generates often looks fine until I run it. Then I hit signature verification failures, wrong raw body handling, or idempotency bugs that process the same event twice. Sound familiar?
I created webhook-skills to fix that. They're agent skills for webhooks: an open-source collection of provider- and framework-specific instructions and runnable examples that AI coding agents can load so they implement webhooks correctly the first time.]]></description>

I wanted something that actually talks to visitors. Something that answers questions about my thesis, explains my projects, and feels alive. But every solution I found either needed a paid server, left the API key sitting in the browser for anyone to steal, or took three days to set up properly.

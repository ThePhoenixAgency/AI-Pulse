      <link>https://dev.to/maxxmini/i-built-18-micro-saas-tools-in-4-days-heres-what-i-learned-1l3o</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The Experiment I challenged myself to build and ship 18 micro SaaS tools in under a week. No frameworks, no backend servers — just static sites on GitHub Pages.
The tools range from a JWT Decoder to a Password Generator to a JSON Formatter. Each one solves exactly one problem.
Here's what actually happened.
1. Zero-server architecture saves everything.
$0.
2. Automation compounds fast.
# One command checks all 18 tools
./health-check.sh
# Output: 18/18 GREEN 3. The 80/20 of features.
1. Discovery is the real problem.
2. "More tools" ≠ "more value."
3. Analytics came too late.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Hi Dev.to community I recently started diving deep into AI agents — systems that can reason, decide, and act autonomously. At first, I experimented with popular frameworks like LangChain, but I realized I didn’t fully understand what an agent actually does or how decisions and tools really work under the hood.
So I decided to build my own library from scratch: SmartAgent.
The goal was simple: make agents transparent, understandable, and easy to experiment with.]]></description>

I spent 30 years building software. The last year convinced me this is the most important unsolved problem in AI infrastructure today.
I went through every major AI agent framework and authorization system. Here's what I found:]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[For years I've been juggling var_dump(), Xdebug setups, and paying for tools like Spatie Ray ($49/year) just to see what my PHP app is doing. None of it felt right — either it broke the page, needed heavy IDE integration, or cost money for something that should be free.
So I built DebugPHP.
DebugPHP streams your debug output to a browser-based dashboard in real-time via Server-Sent Events. No page reloads. No desktop apps. No config hell. Just call Debug::send() and watch it appear.
use DebugPHP\Debug; Debug::init('your-session-token'); Debug::send('User created!');]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Today is about empowering you to build more sophisticated multimedia applications, giving you the tools to manipulate and process media streams in powerful new ways. Let's dive in!
At the heart of every GStreamer pipeline are elements. These are the fundamental building blocks, each designed to perform a specific task – be it reading from a file, decoding audio, converting video formats, or sending data over a network. While we've used elements like filesrc, decodebin, and autovideosink, a deeper understanding of element types and their roles is crucial for advanced pipeline construction.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The EU AI Act becomes fully enforceable on August 2, 2026. Fines reach 35 million euros or 7% of global annual turnover -- whichever is higher. That's not a typo. Seven percent of global revenue.
If you ship an AI feature to users in Europe -- a chatbot, a hiring tool, a recommendation engine, an LLM-powered search bar -- you're in scope. And most applications I've scanned fail compliance checks in ways their developers never considered.
I built ComplianceKit, an open-source scanner that audits AI codebases against the EU AI Act, OWASP LLM Top 10, and NIST AI RMF.]]></description>

go processImportantTask(ctx, data) It feels so simple, so... Go-like. You fire off a goroutine and move on. But what happens when processImportantTask panics? Or the server restarts during a deployment? Or a downstream API it calls is temporarily down?
Your job might be lost forever, or a panic could crash your entire application. The simple "fire-and-forget" goroutine is powerful, but it's not production-safe for tasks you can't afford to lose.

      <description><![CDATA[AI agents operate with broad system access and no enforcement layer between intent and execution. We built an open-source firewall that intercepts every action — MCP, HTTP, subprocess, file I/O — and evaluates it against deterministic policy rules before it runs. Single binary. One command. No code changes to your agent.
Last week, we published a detailed analysis of the OpenClaw and Moltbook breaches — two of the worst AI agent security incidents to date. 1.5 million API keys exposed through a misconfigured database. 42,900 agent instances open to the internet with no authentication.]]></description>

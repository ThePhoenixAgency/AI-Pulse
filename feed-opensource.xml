      <description><![CDATA[L’association Drupal France &amp; Francophonie organise la 13ème édition du Drupalcamp les 9, 10 et 11 avril 2026 au campus Universitaire Grenoble Alpes de Grenoble (France, Isère 38). Drupal est « un système de gestion de contenu (CMS) libre et open-source publié sous la licence publique générale GNU et écrit en PHP ».
Après Rennes en 2024, puis un Barcamp à Perpignan en 2025, cette année 2026 nous emmène au pied des montagnes à Grenoble pour un format de 3 jours de rencontres, soit deux journées de conférences les jeudi et vendredi. La journée du samedi est réservée à la contribution.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[When you share a screen recording with a client, you might not want them downloading the file. We added a per-video download toggle that removes the button, blocks the API, and disables the browser's built-in save option.
You share a product demo with a prospect. They download the MP4, re-upload it somewhere, and now your half-finished UI is floating around the internet without context. Or you record a confidential client review and the recipient saves it locally — outside your control, outside your audit trail.
The fix is simple: let the sender decide whether a video can be downloaded.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Color pickers cover the basics, but designers want full control. We added a custom CSS field that lets users restyle every element on their video watch pages — with server-side injection and security guardrails.
We shipped custom branding a few days ago: logo, company name, four color pickers, footer text. Within hours, our first power user — a designer — asked for more. He wanted to change the font, round the buttons, add a box shadow to the video player, and hide the transcript section entirely. Color pickers don't cover that.
Rather than adding twenty more toggles, we added one textarea:]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I've been writing C# for over 20 years, mostly backend implementations, APIs, services, infrastructure etc… I built frontend too, but it always meant switching to a completely different world. C# on the backend, JavaScript on the frontend. Different patterns, different tooling, different mental models. Every project meant context switching between two ecosystems.
Then I properly dug into Blazor, and something clicked.
Being able to build full stack with C# end-to-end was genuinely enjoyable in a way I didn't expect. No more jumping between languages. No separate JS ecosystem to maintain.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In this article, we review Husky configuration in Letta Code. We will look at:
What is Letta Code? Husky configuration. Letta Code is a deeply personalized stateful agent that lives on your local computer and can learn from experience and improve with use.
Unlike Claude Code, Letta Code is open source, model agnostic (use Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any model you want), and most importantly, is stateful, meaning that you can use the same agent across many coding sessions, and have it learn and improve over time.
Learn more about Letta Code.
Husky improves your commits.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I'm ykagano, a backend engineer working on payment systems.
Running a single WireMock instance is straightforward. POST JSON to /__admin/mappings to register stubs, reset when testing is done. Simple.
But things change when you run into situations like these.
Scaling out for load testing.
When you place multiple WireMock instances behind a load balancer, you need to distribute the same stubs to all of them. You might think, "Why not share stub JSON files via Docker volumes?" That does solve file distribution, but WireMock doesn't automatically detect file changes.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I use Mermaid diagrams a lot. Architecture docs, PR descriptions, onboarding flows — they're everywhere in my projects.
But every time I need to quickly iterate on one, I end up in the Mermaid Live Editor. Which works... but feels clunky. No themes, the UI is busy, and exporting is annoying.
So I added a Mermaid Studio to webtoolz.dev.
Themes. Not just "default" and "dark" — actual styled themes like Blueprint, Forest, Neutral. Pick one from the dropdown and your diagram looks completely different.
Templates. Don't want to remember the syntax for a state diagram? Grab a template.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Why do our local AI agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude) forget everything? Because we're treating cognitive memory like throwaway logs. I just released v1.0.7 of Nucleus-MCP—a sovereign command deck for AI agents. It implements a local-first memory model that doesn't rely on cloud intermediates.
We launched on Product Hunt today to see if there's interest in a "Local Data First" future. We're at #86—likely because we aren't another 'AI Chat wrapper.'
I’m looking for technical critics who want to rip into the architecture.

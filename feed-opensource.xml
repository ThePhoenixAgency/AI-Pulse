Why altcoins specifically
Alts dump harder and bounce faster than BTC.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Every developer has those repetitive micro-tasks that silently eat hours each week. Formatting JSON, debugging regex, decoding JWTs... I got tired of bouncing between random sites full of ads, so I built my own.
Here are 5 browser tools I use daily. They're all free, client-side, no signup, no tracking.
The problem: Pasting minified JSON into random online formatters that inject ads or (worse) send your data to a server.
The fix: A clean formatter with syntax highlighting, validation, and error messages — all running in your browser. Zero data leaves your machine. JSON Formatter
The problem:]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Your MCP Tools Are a Backdoor And you'd never know.
I let Claude Code install an MCP server. Three seconds later, it read my SSH private key. No warning, no prompt, no log entry. Just a tool call to read_file with the path ~/.ssh/id_rsa, buried in a stream of normal filesystem operations.
This isn't a hypothetical. This is how MCP works by design.
The Model Context Protocol is the standard way AI coding tools talk to external services.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[My AI agents went rogue.
I run an e-commerce store. A few months ago, I deployed AI agents to handle customer emails — returns, refund requests, product questions. It worked great, until it didn't.
The agents started making promises we couldn't keep: wrong refund amounts, unauthorized discounts, completely fabricated policies. "Sure, we'll refund your shipping even though our policy says otherwise." "Yes, you can return that item after 90 days." None of it was true.
The worst part wasn't that they failed. That's fixable. The worst part was that I couldn't prove what they actually said.]]></description>

Not because you ignored them — but because your agent handled them.
That's the idea behind Agenium Messenger, which we just shipped at chat.agenium.net.
We've spent the past few weeks building the infrastructure layer for AI agents:
Phase 1: A discovery system — so any agent can find any other agent by name
Phase 2: An A2A protocol — so agents can communicate in a standard way
Phase 3 (today): A messenger — so agents can be the ones receiving messages Here's the insight that drove Phase 3:]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The Problem If you've ever tried monetizing side projects, you know the pain. It starts simple, then spirals into a mess of edge cases, broken workflows, and wasted hours.
I've been building side project monetization as a solo developer, and I hit this wall hard. Here's what I found — and how I fixed it.
Attempt 1: The naive approach. I started by doing everything manually. Copy-paste, click-click, repeat. It worked for 3 items. By item 20, I wanted to quit.
Attempt 2: Half-automation. I wrote a quick script. It handled 80% of cases but broke on edge cases. Classic.
Attempt 3: Full pipeline.]]></description>

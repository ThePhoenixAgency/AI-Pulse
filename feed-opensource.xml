Not because I thought I'd become famous--mostly because I was frustrated that no single repository existed as a definitive guide to codebase intelligence tools and practices. I wanted to solve my own problem and maybe help others along the way.
Fast forward six months: the awesome-codebase-intelligence list has earned over 2,500 GitHub stars, gets contributions from developers worldwide, and was featured in several newsletters. More importantly, it's become a genuine resource people refer to when evaluating tools.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I am trying to publish something on npm to get the taste of opensource development but could never due to lack of time or the right idea.
So while working on another project which required reliable way to preview files in some sort of googleish way.
And lack of existing libs forces me to built one myself.
And it suddenly hit me that "why not to build it like an independent module which i could later publish as well".
so i built one under 15kb
So now when ever you feel you need a way to preview files in a structured way visit npm/iammrverma
Use it, share your thoughts, find bugs, happy coding :]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Originally published on andrew.ooo
TL;DR: MoltWorker is an open-source framework that deploys OpenClaw agents to Cloudflare's global edge network. Deploy agents to 300+ data centers worldwide, get 40-60% latency reduction, and pay ~$5/month for 100K requests instead of $50-150 for traditional cloud hosting.
MoltWorker is an open-source deployment framework that packages OpenClaw AI agents as Cloudflare Workers and deploys them globally. Instead of running agents on a single server in one region, MoltWorker distributes your agent across Cloudflare's 300+ edge locations worldwide.
The result?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Three months ago, I built a CLI tool to score codebase health. I called it codebase-health-score (original, I know). The goal was simple: give a team a single number that represents the overall health of their system.
The project started as a weekend hack. It turned into something people actually use. And in the process, I learned that "codebase health" is a much more slippery concept than it initially appeared.
Our team was going through the classic scenario: we had inherited a codebase from an acquisition. It was "messy." But how messy? Nobody could quantify it.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Building a PostgreSQL Parser in Go: What Broke After We Open-Sourced It postgresparser is a pure-Go PostgreSQL SQL parser. It turns SQL text into structured metadata (tables, columns, joins, filters, DDL actions, parameters) without executing queries.
We thought it was solid. Open source proved we were wrong.
Here is what open source forced us to learn.
The biggest shift was not “more bug reports.” It was use-case expansion. We built for our workflow. Users showed up with very different workloads.
Inside a single team, ambiguous behavior survives because everyone “knows” the rules.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The EU AI Act isn't a distant policy paper anymore. Enforcement began in 2025, and if your AI system serves EU users, you're already in scope.
But most developers I've spoken to still ask: "What do I actually need to DO?"
Here are the 5 obligations that directly affect your code — with practical examples.
The rule: Any AI system interacting with humans must clearly disclose that users are dealing with AI.
This applies to chatbots, AI-generated emails, synthetic media, and automated decision systems.
In practice:

      <description><![CDATA[Anthropic quietly updated their docs this week with a policy that affects a lot of developers:
"Using OAuth tokens obtained through Claude Free, Pro, or Max accounts in any other product, tool, or service, including the Agent SDK, is not permitted and constitutes a violation of the Consumer Terms of Service."
Translation: if you've been using your $200/month Claude Max subscription in the Agent SDK, OpenCode, Cursor, or any third-party tool, that's no longer allowed. The only place those tokens work is Claude Code CLI itself.
For everyone else? You're on API billing now.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Every time an AI agent completes a task, it forgets everything. The conversation context vanishes. The user preferences it inferred are gone. The multi-step reasoning chain it constructed dissolves. If you have built anything with LLM-based agents, you have hit this wall: agents are stateless by default, and making them stateful is an unsolved architecture problem for most teams.
This is not the same challenge as caching database queries or managing user sessions.]]></description>

Your folder structure, your naming conventions, the reason you chose Drizzle over Prisma, the three environment variables that need to be set before the test suite runs. By the end of the session, Claude Code understood your codebase like a senior team member.
Today, you open a new session. Blank slate. It does not remember any of it.

      <description><![CDATA[Your agent forgets who it is every session. Here's how to fix that.
You built an AI agent. It's great — until you restart it. Then it has no idea what it did yesterday, what it learned, or who it was becoming. You paste context back in manually, or worse, it just starts fresh every time.
This is the identity persistence problem. Every agent builder hits it eventually.
Anima is an open-source SDK that gives your agent persistent identity, decaying memory, and crash recovery. File-based, zero dependencies, works with any LLM.
npm install @getanima/core import { Anima } from '@getanima/core';]]></description>

I wanted something that actually talks to visitors. Something that answers questions about my thesis, explains my projects, and feels alive. But every solution I found either needed a paid server, left the API key sitting in the browser for anyone to steal, or took three days to set up properly.
So I built my own — and then open-sourced it so you can have it too.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Domoticz access blocked]]></title>
      <link>https://forum.domoticz.com/viewtopic.php?p=331760#p331760</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Hi, I am using Domoticz on a Raspberry Pi. After an update, a login screen appears upon startup. It asks for a username and password. Then a message appears stating they are incorrect, and after three attempts, a screen appears with the message: "congratulations …….the end of the internet". The strange thing is that Domoticz is otherwise working fine; the lights are on. But Domoticz is inaccessible.
Software and hardware used:
Domoticz running on a Raspberry Pi.
What I have already found or tried:
I connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH. I tried to repair Domoticz or completely reinstall it. Nothing helped.
Does anyone have a solution to my problem?

      <title><![CDATA[Heiman joins Works with Home Assistant]]></title>
      <link>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2026/02/24/heiman-joins-works-with-home-assistant/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[After an amazing 2025 that saw 12 new Works with Home Assistant partners join the program, it’s now time to say “Hei” to the first partner joining us this year: Heiman.
Founded back in 2005, Heiman specialize in smart home security devices, and are bringing an impressive selection of safety-focused sensors and alarms to the program: including the first Matter carbon monoxide alarms to be certified, along with smoke alarms designed for international markets.
Keep it local, keep it safe
If you’re new to the Works with Home Assistant program, it’s designed to help you identify devices that work brilliantly with Home Assistant, and support the Open Home Foundation’s principles of privacy, choice, and sustainability.
These values all pivot around local control, something that’s essential when it comes to home safety. Your smoke and CO alarms need to work when you need them most, regardless of your internet connection or cloud service status (though if you want to check in on your devices while away from home, Home Assistant Cloud provides secure remote access, and your subscription helps fund this very program, among other things!).
Our in-house team has thoroughly tested Heiman’s devices to ensure they meet this key requirement, and we’re happy to report they did! But Heiman has gone further still by using the Matter open connectivity standard…
Why this matters
Matter was launched to be a unifying connectivity type with interoperability at its heart. Instead of being locked into one company’s ecosystem, Matter devices work across Home Assistant, as well as other platforms like Google Home.
Heiman’s Matter devices work over Thread, which adds another layer of benefits. Thread is a low-power wireless mesh network protocol that creates resilient connectivity throughout your home, perfect for battery-powered sensors that need reliable communication while staying energy efficient. This is ideal for battery-powered sensors like Heiman’s that need to be energy efficient while maintaining reliable communication.
So why does all this matter for safety devices specifically? Well firstly, it’s important to know these smart devices will still work as “dumb” ones, so there’s always a failsafe if you decide to rebuild your Thread network, or start making tweaks. If your sensors integrate locally, it means you can automate basic checks, such as reminders to test an alarm once a month, or notifications of hardware faults. If you want to go even further, your smoke alarm could trigger emergency lighting, your CO detector could shut off your gas fireplace, or your leak sensor could close water valves, all without sending your private data through a third-party server. And this is just the sort of complete, interoperable ecosystem Heiman aims to provide.
"Our core goal has always been to enable every family to enjoy a safe and intelligent living experience. Home Assistant, as a world-leading open source smart home platform, has an open and inclusive ecological philosophy and strong compatibility with multi-brand and multi-protocol devices, which are highly consistent with the direction of our product research and development. We deeply understand that only by integrating into an open ecosystem can we break down device barriers and provide users with a truly seamless whole-house smart solution."
- Leo Xie, Software Engineer Manager at Heiman Working with the community
Heiman is showing they’re true to these ambitions. Beyond getting certified, they’re planning to take an active role in the Home Assistant community by participating in discussions, listening to real-world feedback, and continuously optimizing their products based on what users actually need. They’re also sharing their technical expertise in smart home security, collaborating with developers to explore innovative safety scenarios that benefit everyone.
Devices
Heiman’s commitment to openness and community is also reflected in the devices we’ve certified, which also meet strict safety regulations across the US, Europe, Asia and beyond. Before Heiman joined, we had one Zigbee smoke alarm in the program. Now there are Matter options for multiple regions, plus the first certified carbon monoxide alarms: more choice, more coverage.
What devices have been certified?
Heiman Smart Smoke Alarm (USA)
Heiman Smart Smoke Alarm (EU and China)
Heiman Smart Carbon Monoxide Alarm (USA)
Heiman Smart Carbon Monoxide Alarm (EU and China)
Heiman Motion Sensor
Heiman Water Leak Sensor
Heiman Humidity and Temperature Sensor
Also worth noting: Heiman’s global presence allows them to deliver quality devices at prices that won’t break the bank. Safety sensors and alarms shouldn’t be a luxury, and Heiman’s approach means they don’t have to be.
No more guessing games!
Accessible pricing is just one way Heiman expands choice for users. We’ve found they also deliver on the other core principles behind the Works with Home Assistant program: local control protects privacy, and open standards ensure sustainability. And that’s the whole point of our certification process: to make it easier for you to spot manufacturers who genuinely commit to these values, taking the guesswork out of building your open home. For full details of all Works with Home Assistant partners, check out our certified device list.
Welcome to the program, Heiman, we’re excited to see what the community builds with these devices!
Frequently asked questions
If I have a device that is not listed under Works with Home Assistant, does this mean it’s not supported?
No! It just means that it hasn’t gone through a testing schedule with our team, or doesn’t fit the requirements of the program. It might function perfectly well but be added to the testing schedule in the future.
OK, so what’s the point of the Works with program?
It highlights the devices we know work well with Home Assistant and the brands that make a long-term commitment to keeping support for these devices going. The certification agreement specifies that brands must continue to support the devices in the program.
How were these devices tested?
All devices in this list were tested using a standard Home Assistant Green Hub with the Home Assistant Connect ZBT-2 as the Thread Border Router and with our certified Matter integration.
Will you be adding more Heiman devices to the program?
Why not! We’re thrilled to foster a close relationship with the team at Heiman to work together on any upcoming releases or add in further products that are not yet listed here. We are also chatting with them about some exciting future plans.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Hello de Charly]]></title>
      <link>https://community.gladysassistant.com/t/hello-de-charly/10031</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Bonjour,
Gladys est juste ce dont j’avais besoin maintenant. J’y suis arrivé via la vidéo de AyLabs.
Je viens de prendre ma retraite, j’étais dans l’IT, je faisais des projets de virtualisation, et j’ai déménagé dans ma petite maison dans le sud (je plante le décor aussi pour montrer que rentrer dans le yaml ne me fait pas peur, mais me fait ch… un peu).
J’avais juste une box Lidl avec des prises et lampes connectées et un détecteur de mouvement, quelques automatisations, une caméra et autres appareils Xiaomi, un lave-linge Samsung sous SmartThings, rien de bien compliqué. J’avais monté un Proxmox, avec une vm HA.
Alors, je ne dis pas que c’est compliqué, mais c’est bien chiant. Et si tu n’as pas envie de passer des heures dessus, c’est vite le b… Et je ne parle pas du WAF…
Je pense que HA est un outil magnifique, hyper complet, qui répond à tous les scénarios, mais qui est assez inaccessible au néophyte, au partenaire dans ta maison, ou disons qu’il demande un temps et un effort énorme pour avoir qq chose de présentable et utilisable.
Je rentre donc dans Gladys Assistant avec enthousiasme. Gladys est élégant, et même si j’ai eu des galères pour appairer mes appareils Zigbee avec mon dongle Sonoff (ma faute sûrement, car j’ai pas ou mal lu la doc), le support est top et l’interface facile…
Bref, je vais voir maintenant intégrer mes appareils Matter Ikea et le reste.

      <title><![CDATA[Airplane tracker plugin]]></title>
      <link>https://forum.domoticz.com/viewtopic.php?p=331496#p331496</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I designed a plugin for Airplane Tracking based on the work of @janpep 'Script for Airplanes.live API'.
Installation is quite simple.
1) mkdir ~/domoticz/plugins/AirPlaneTracker
2) Copy the code to ~/domoticz/plugins/AirPlaneTracker/plugin.py
3) do a 'sudo systemctl restart domoticz'
4) Goto hardware and select the plugin 'Airplane Tracker', give it a name (adapt settings) and click on 'Add'
5) Goto the 'Utility'tab, find the Airplanes - Counter, click edit and change the counter Type from Energy to Custom
5) Off you go
The names of the sensors are made up of 2 parts.
- The name you give to the plugin @install
- the name of the sensor
Example: I gave the plugin the name Vliegtuigen so the name of the Tracker sensor is Vliegtuigen - Tracker
The sensors are:
Tracker - displays the planes flying over your head
Counter - counts the planes flying over your head
Types - Counts the types of planes flying over your head When you click on the CallSign of an plane like KLM1844 or RYR9HN or BAW979 in de Tracker sensor, a new Airplanes.live tab opens in your browser and shows the plane on the map. This is a one day score within 9 miles from my house. Code: # Airplane Tracker Plugin for Domoticz# Author: Hein""" Airplane Tracker Monitor live air traffic around your location using the airplanes.live API. Features Tracker: Shows the last 3 aircraft detected with details (altitude, speed, direction) Counter: Cumulative count of all aircraft seen (resets daily by Domoticz) Types: Daily summary of aircraft types detected Configuration Radius: Detection radius in miles around your Domoticz location API Interval: Time between API calls in seconds (default: 60). Log Unknown Types: Logs unclassified types to ~/unknown_aircraft_types.log. Log Level: Controls logging verbosity. Important - Counter Device: After creation, go to Devices, click Edit on the Counter, and change Type to Custom.

      <link>https://community.home-assistant.io/t/google-nest-camera-integration-intermittently-fails/991358</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I have had my google nest doorbell (battery) setup using the Google nest integration. This worked for around two years until I started experiencing problems. Around late December or early January of this year, the nest integration stopped working and I get this error:
Logger: homeassistant.components.nest
Source: components/nest/__init__.py:301
integration: Google Nest (documentation, issues)
First occurred: 7:09:40 PM (16 occurrences)
Last logged: 7:43:15 PM Subscriber error: Unexpected error when calling streaming_pull: Timeout in streaming_pull Mid January, I deleted my credentials, did nothing for a week, and when I went to re-add the integration everything worked again. Then last week, the nest integration stopped working and I am getting the same error. Some things of note: When the integration first failed, my connection to google calendar, gemini, and google keep (through a custom integration) all stopped working at the same time. With the latest failure, only Nest and Google Keep Sync have stopped working. I can see the API requests on the google cloud console, but almost all requests result in errors. Any help resolving this would be much appreciated!

      <title><![CDATA[The 5‑year home automation post that made me rethink everything]]></title>
      <link>https://community.home-assistant.io/t/the-5-year-home-automation-post-that-made-me-rethink-everything/991353</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back in January I shared a 5‑year technical review of our home automation setup here. At the time, my goal was pretty simple: review the infrastructure that had to change, capture what held up, what didn’t, and what surprised me after living with a fairly complex system day to day.
What I didn’t expect was what writing that post would trigger.
Technically, most of the system worked.
But while writing the review, something uncomfortable became clear:
thinking about the house more than I wanted to.
Not because it was broken — but because it demanded attention:
checking whether things were behaving as expected
wondering what would happen during an internet outage
choreographing guest access
managing notifications instead of trusting them
treating privacy as something to actively manage
That post ended up being the moment I stopped asking
“How do I automate this?”
What would it mean for a home to actually behave well?
Not smarter.
That shift in framing changed very concrete things about the system:
automation stopped being about clever triggers and started being about policy
notifications were redesigned so silence actually meant something
guest access became time‑bound and self‑cleaning
outages stopped being stressful because behavior was predictable
privacy became an outcome of architecture, not a setting
I ended up writing a lot of this down, mostly to make sure I wasn’t just rationalizing decisions after the fact.
This was the original post that kicked off that rethinking: Technical Pivot 5‑Years Later
I’m not posting this as a how‑to, recommendation, or stack endorsement — just sharing the reflection in case it resonates with anyone else who’s been living with a system long enough to feel both proud of it and a little tired of it at the same time.
Happy to discuss if it’s useful.

      <title><![CDATA[Your support please - Improving HA's recorder, Database and associated user interface]]></title>
      <link>https://community.home-assistant.io/t/your-support-please-improving-has-recorder-database-and-associated-user-interface/991323</link>
      <description><![CDATA[tl,dr: Here to seek your support for a feature request on improving how HA’s databases work, what goes into them, and how they are maintained.
After recently having a major blowout in my SQLite database (reaching 1.8 Gb), it prompted me to sit down and review a number of things related to recorder: and just what data was stored in my HA DB.
Doing so sent me further down a rabbit hole, thinking about how HA is setup from the start, what happens when new integrations and devices are added, and the high learning curve new users to the platform have when it comes to understanding what goes into the database and achieving an optimal configuration that doesn’t tax their hardware or storage.
Long story short: HA has some really great opportunities in this space to help users optimise the database for performance, size, and reduced load/storage device wear.
To this end, I have opened a significant and detailed Feature request, and I’d appreciate your support and/or discussion on it:
GitHub Database &amp; Recorder integration: Overhaul UI to permit reduced DB size...
Describe your core improvement Prompt at instance setup to configure settings for proper DB maintenance from the outset: As part of the onboarding/instance first time setup process, or at a later s... The feature request above covers all the usual topics, which I hope will assist you providing unqualified support, and discussion that might help drive better outcomes and faster update by the HA core team.
I also have a separate blog post that goes deeper into the detail on the topic, especially when it comes to the theory and practice of optimising an existing instance for others with the same dilemma I had.
Thanks in advance for your votes and discussions, it will be appreciated.

Vous avez sûrement entendu parler d’OpenClaw, le framework IA qui a explosé sur GitHub il y a quelques semaines, et qui vient d’être racheté par OpenAI.

      <link>https://community.openhab.org/t/sonos-items-work-in-eclipse-not-in-production-upnp-problem/168650</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I’ve been using the Sonos binding for years. I have about 12 amps and I play whole house music from a filesystem of MP3s on my local NAS. My openhab is a 5.1.3 installation on a Debian-based server at my house. I use 3 scripts:
A morning script that sets the volume of 10 different amps, joins them to a single “control” amp, and starts playback on that amp.
A later-in-the-morning script that increases the volume plus-one-at-a-time on a handful of those amps (the ones closer to my bedroom)
An evening script that decreases the volume minus-one-at-a-time on all amps, until they reach 0, then pauses the music, then resets the volumes to sane values for the next day.
I have been annoyed for some time, that the Coordinator value isn’t working right. It doesn’t properly reflect the “control” amp. Most of the amps either show NULL, or their own UDN as the value of the Coordinator. I was motivated recently to look at the code, because when I turn on the family room TV, I want the kitchen amp to change sources to family room TV (rather than the “control” amp playing the whole-house music). Having finished messing around with the Blink Binding, I decided to look at the Sonos Binding code.
I updated the demo distribution “app” xml to include the Sonos binding (alongside the Blink binding I’ve been developing). I struggled with the stupid dependency refresh buttons for an hour or two (translation: I don’t understand what it’s doing), and I got it working. I use a Mac laptop as my desktop / development environment. openhab calls itself a 5.2.0-SNAPSHOT version.
It found the Sonos amps, and I added the Things from the inbox, then created a number of Items.
To my surprise, it all works perfectly on the laptop instance of openhab running within eclipse.
I tried to copy the .jar file from the Mac to the server, just like I had done successfully with the Blink binding jar file, but it won’t run, it complains about a upnp package missing:
2026-02-25 00:55:12.669 [WARN ] [org.apache.felix.fileinstall ] - Error while starting bundle: file:/usr/share/openhab/addons/org.openhab.binding.sonos-5.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Could not resolve module: org.openhab.binding.sonos [311] Unresolved requirement: Import-Package: org.openhab.core.config.discovery.upnp at org.eclipse.osgi.container.Module.start(Module.java:463) ~[org.eclipse.osgi-3.18.0.jar:?] at org.eclipse.osgi.internal.framework.EquinoxBundle.start(EquinoxBundle.java:445) ~[org.eclipse.osgi-3.18.0.jar:?] at org.apache.felix.fileinstall.internal.DirectoryWatcher.startBundle(DirectoryWatcher.java:1260) [bundleFile:3.7.4] Stymied by not being able to run the 5.2.0 SNAPSHOT version of Sonos on my server, I tried a different approach…
Guessing perhaps I had some stale Things in my server-based openhab 5.1.3 instance, I deleted all 66 Sonos Items, all Sonos Things, and uninstalled the Sonos Add-On. I reinstalled the add-on from the marketplace, and proceeded to recreate dozens of Things and Items.
It still doesn’t work. The volume Items are all NULL, and the Coordinator values are generally set to each amp’s own UDN. The controls work but the state updates back to the Items don’t:
If I use the MediaControl for the “control” amp, I can advance to the next song (good)
If I use debian server openhab to modify the volume of one amp, then the Item will show the new volume (good) (and also, the volume does change in the room)
If I use the Sonos app to modify the volume of one amp, then the debian server openhab Item does not change (bad), but the Mac/eclipse openhab Item does change (good)
So it’s probably not the Sonos Binding. But what is it? Server openhab Sonos Binding is not receiving incoming updates from the Sonos hardware, but Mac openhab Sonos Binding is.
Not even sure where to start.
The server is on wired ethernet, in the same IP network range as the MacBook’s wifi. They are both on a 192.168.192./18 network. Both the MacBook and the server are in 192.168.213. range and the Sonos amps are in 192.168.215.* range. Again, based on netmask these are the same network, it is a /18, NOT a /24.
During openhab startup on the server (but not on the MacBook), there is an ominous message:
2026-02-25 00:46:29.974 [INFO ] [.network.internal.utils.NetworkUtils] - CIDR prefix is smaller than /24 on interface with address 192.168.213.20/18, truncating to /24, some addresses might be lost But I don’t know who’s responsible for that message, so I don’t know the scope of what it affects. Might be relevant, but then again, the MacBook eclipse openhab works just fine on this same network range (and without the INFO log message).
Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

      <link>https://forum.domoticz.com/viewtopic.php?p=331769#p331769</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Domoticz version: 2025.2 (build 17252)
Platform: (Raspbian 13.2)
After upgrading to the latest beta version 2025.2 (build 17252), I noticed an issue with the lastUpdate.minutesAgo parameter in DzVents.
I am using OWFS 1-Wire temperature sensors.
The sensors update correctly — at least once per minute (confirmed in the device log and hardware level).
In my DzVents scripts, I check:
device.lastUpdate.minutesAgo
Since the last update, even though the sensor was updated less than a minute ago, Domoticz shows an increasing minutesAgo value indefinitely for randomly selected sensors.
The value keeps increasing as if the device had not been updated at all, while in reality:
The device value is changing correctly.
The device “Last Update” timestamp in the UI appears correct.
Only lastUpdate.minutesAgo in DzVents is incorrect.
The issue does not affect all sensors at once — it appears randomly on different OWFS devices. The same scripts worked correctly in previous versions.

      <description><![CDATA[​Bonjour,
​Nouveau sur Gladys et habitué à bidouiller sur Home Assistant, j’ai voulu migrer pour plus de simplicité. Cependant, je rencontre plusieurs problèmes suite à une mauvaise configuration réseau qui a fait crasher mon serveur Unraid.
​Ma Configuration :
​Hardware : Lenovo ThinkCentre M710q.
​Stockage : DAS TerraMaster 4 baies (USB).
​Dongles : Zigbee (sur /dev/ttyACM0) et Bluetooth Asus BT500.
​Gladys : Installée via Docker sur Unraid (actuellement en mode Bridge sur le port 8006 pour éviter les conflits).
​Le problème :
Suite à une tentative de configuration du dongle Bluetooth, j’ai passé Gladys en mode réseau Host, ce qui a provoqué un crash total d’Unraid (conflit d’IP/Ports) et une corruption de ma clé de boot. J’ai dû recréer une « New Config » et supprimer l’image Docker corrompue.
​Depuis, j’ai deux soucis majeurs :
​Services MQTT et Zigbee : Les containers intégrés n’existent plus. J’ai tenté une réinstallation manuelle via l’onglet Apps d’Unraid, mais Gladys ne semble plus communiquer avec eux.
​Y a-t-il un moyen de forcer Gladys à réinstaller et gérer elle-même ces containers (Mosquitto/Zigbee2MQTT) pour retrouver le fonctionnement natif ?
​ m’assurer que les nouveaux containers pointent correctement vers mes anciennes données dans /mnt/user/appdata/ ?
​Bluetooth (Asus BT500) : Mon dongle n’est toujours pas reconnu dans l’interface Gladys (« Pas de dispositif trouvé »). J’ai pourtant activé le mode Privileged et tenté un passthrough USB via /dev/bus/usb, mais sans succès.
​Avez-vous une astuce pour stabiliser le Bluetooth sur Unraid et lier correctement les services MQTT/Zigbee après un tel crash ?
​Merci d’avance pour votre aide !
Cordialement,
Didier

      <link>https://community.openhab.org/t/commands-that-are-sent-to-aqara-h2eu-rollershutter-are-divided-by-100/168621</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Hi all,
I have several H2EU Rollershutter devices that I operate in Matter mode.
The devices have been correctly added to OpenHAB via Matter. I can see their state. If I close them manually via the hardware button, the state updates fine in OpenHAB to a value between 0 and 100 (where 100 is fully closed).
The weird thing happens, when I try to send commands to the device: Sending “100” as command closes the rollershutter exactly 1%. After the blinds stop moving, state in OpenHAB shows as “1”. Sending any other number between 0 and 99 drives the blinds to fully open state.
Consequently it seems as if the value is somehow divided by 100 before it is sent to the device. I tried multiplying my value by 100 (e.g. sending 5000), but anything &gt;100 is ignored completely.
Log, when sending “100”:

It did not really change a thing (other than 0 and 1 being the only “valid” numbers to send - still not able to lower the blinds below 1%).
Problem does not seem to be about the hardware of the device itself (I thought that first), since a parallel HomeAssistant installation can operate the rollershutter fine.
OpenHAB is on version 5.1.1 (running within docker container)
Firmware on all devices is upgraded to the current version.
I am really running out of ideas what else I can try. If anybody would have any ideas about this, it would be greatly appreciated.

      <description><![CDATA[Bonjour à tous,
Je viens de publier une nouvelle version de Gladys, avec plusieurs améliorations et corrections Nouveautés
Intégration Matterbridge : Gladys vous permet maintenant de lancer un container Matterbridge en un clic dans Gladys, ouvrant la porte à encore plus d’appareils compatibles. Si vous voulez savoir j’ai développé cette intégration avec l’IA, je vous en dis plus sur YouTube :
Claude AI a codé mon intégration domotique en 30 min (j'ai rien fait)
La documentation : Matterbridge | Gladys Assistant Attention, si vous avez déjà lancé Matterbridge sur votre instance, cela peut entraîner un conflit de port. Il n’y a pas de réel intérêt à vouloir lancer Matterbridge via Gladys si vous avez déjà pu le lancer vous-même en dehors de Gladys Favoris pour les intégrations : Vous pouvez désormais marquer vos intégrations préférées en favoris pour les retrouver plus facilement.
Tasmota : Découverte automatique de l’IP via MQTT, lien direct vers l’interface de l’appareil, et un meilleur tri lors de la découverte. Corrections et améliorations
Widget température dans les pièces : Les valeurs aberrantes de température sont désormais exclues, et la conversion en Fahrenheit pour la valeur maximale est corrigée.
Chat : Les espaces dans les messages sont maintenant correctement préservés grâce au pre-wrap.
Exemple: DuckDB mis à jour en version 1.4.4.
Correction de fautes de frappe dans les traductions.
Amélioration de la robustesse du service MCP.
Merci à tous les contributeurs : @bertrandda, @mutmut @Will_71 @qleg et @Terdious pour ce beau travail collaboratif ! Bonne mise à jour ! 12 messages - 5 participant(e)s

      <link>https://forum.domoticz.com/viewtopic.php?p=331742#p331742</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Hello.
I have a problem with my Ecodevice (First génération) provided by GCE Electronics.
(2 inputs for téléinfo one and two and 2 others inputs for 2 counters)
It works perfectly when I connect only teleinfo1.
All devices are created: Teleinfo 1 Alerte courant,Teleinfo 1 Tarif en cours,Teleinfo 1 Pourcentage de Charge,Teleinfo 1 Courant, Teleinfo 1 kWh Total
(It's also OK for the 2 counters C1 and C2)
But when I connect the second signal téléinfo2, devices are also created, except 1 (the most important) : Teleinfo 2 kWh.
The datas for téleinfo1 are briefly displayed on the sensor Teleinfo 1 kWh but immediatly replaced with Teleinfo2's datas.
On the log, I have twice the line for Teleinfo 2 kWh Total (2 differents lines for others sensors like teleinfo courant)
2026-02-23 12:55:47.050 ECO-DEVICES: Fetching Teleinfo 1 data
2026-02-23 12:55:47.152 ECO-DEVICES: Fetching Teleinfo 2 data
2026-02-23 12:55:47.152 ECO-DEVICES: P1 Smart Meter (Teleinfo 2 kWh Total)
2026-02-23 12:55:47.257 ECO-DEVICES: P1 Smart Meter (Teleinfo 2 kWh Total)
...
2026-02-23 12:55:47.259 ECO-DEVICES: Current (Teleinfo 2 Courant)
2026-02-23 12:56:47.754 ECO-DEVICES: Current (Teleinfo 1 Courant)
...
Iknow that Ecodevice (first generation) is an old system.
I know also that this system is only used in France ,and for almost everyone only one teleinfo signal.
And perhaps the problem comes from GCE Electronics.
So I'm not sure someone can help me… But I still hope...

      <description><![CDATA[Bonjour,
Comme promis, voici un tutoriel afin de connecter une clé SMLIGHT à Gladys via le réseau et non via USB car sinon on perd tout l’intérêt de cette clé en la branchant en USB Gladys ne prenant en charge que le mode USB @pierre-gilles arrête moi si je me trompe , je suis partie sur une installation avec un MQTT et Z2M externe à Gladys.
@pierre-gilles ?
Ici pour z2m en https j’utilise le port 443 mais pour éviter tout conflit si vous décider de tout installer sur la même machine il faudrait modifier par le port 4343 par exemple J’avais déjà fais un tuto complet sur HAOS à l’époque ou je l’utilisais que vous pouvez retrouver ici : Home Assistant Communauté Francophone – 29 May 25 [Tuto] Installer HAOS sur Proxmox avec Z2M et MQTT (Full SSL/TLS - Lets Encrypt) Home Assistant - Tutoriels &amp; Partages Installation tutoriel L’idée de ce tutoriel est de regrouper un peu toutes les infos que j’ai pu trouver pour l’installation de HAOS, Z2M et MQTT sur des VM séparés au sein de Proxmox et le tout en full SSL/TLS (Lets encrypt) sur ce type de machine : ...
Temps de lecture: 7 mins J'aime: 15 Installation Mosquitto (Mqtt)
Installer une VM sous ubuntu 24.04, mettez la complétement à jour et lancez les commandes suivantes :
Pour installer docker :

Pour ce faire, la commande doit connaître la clé API, sinon elle échouera silencieusement.
Afin d’activer le renouvellement automatique de vos certificats génériques, vous devrez modifier /lib/systemd/system/certbot.service. Ajoutez-y la ligne suivante dans Service, en remplaçant par votre jeton :

      <link>https://forum.domoticz.com/viewtopic.php?p=331382#p331382</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I used "Open Hardware Monitor" for a long time with a Domoticz "Motherboard" hardware entry. With my new PC "Open Hardware Monitor" doesn't support many of the motherboards sensors. Some older Domoticz release notes are showing that "Libre Hardware Monitor" is supported. However, if I try to use it like "Open Hardware Monitor" it seems not to be recogniced by Domoticz. Further more I couldn't find any how to hints. Can anyone give advise?
Addition: Domoticz Log shows "Warning, neither Libre Hardware Monitor nor Open Hardware Monitor are installed on this system."
However, Libre Hardware Monitor is running: Domoticz 2025.2 is running on Windows 11 as Libre Hardware Monitor 0.9.5

      <link>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2026/01/07/release-20261/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Happy New Year! I hope you had a wonderful holiday, spending time with your loved ones. We’re kicking off 2026 with a smaller release, as our contributors and maintainers have been enjoying some well-deserved time off as well. But don’t worry, there’s still plenty of good stuff in this release!
Home Assistant 2026.1 brings a refreshed Home dashboard experience on mobile, with summary cards right at your fingertips without extra taps. We’ve also made it easier than ever to navigate to the protocol connecting your devices, such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, Thread and more.
For automation enthusiasts, we’re continuing our work on our even more “human-friendly” triggers, which can be enabled via Home Assistant Labs, so you can build automations using easy-to-understand language instead of technical state changes, like initiating automations if a button is pressed or someone arrives home.
On the integrations front, we welcome eight new integrations to the family, including pet tracking with Fressnapf, energy monitoring with eGauge, and smart heating control with Watts Vision +. Plus, improvements to existing integrations from our amazing community contributors.
I wish you a happy and healthy 2026! Enjoy the release!

A huge thank you to all the contributors who made this release possible! And a special shout-out to @bramkragten, @piitaya, and @abmantis who helped write the release notes for this release. Home dashboard improvements
The Home dashboard continues to evolve! In the previous release, we introduced a brand-new sidebar layout, weather tiles, and energy distribution summaries. This release takes it even further with a streamlined mobile experience and better device management.
Streamlined mobile navigation
On mobile devices, the Home dashboard now displays summary cards (like lights, climate, security, media players, weather, and energy) directly at the top of the view, followed by your favorites and areas. This replaces the previous tab-based navigation, giving you instant access to everything that matters without any extra taps.
The desktop experience remains unchanged, with summaries displayed in the sidebar under the For you heading.
New devices page
Ever wondered where your devices went after you removed them from an area? A new Devices page now appears on the Home dashboard, showing all devices that aren’t currently assigned to a specific area. This makes it easy to find and control those “orphaned” devices without hunting through the settings.
The new Devices page shows devices not assigned to any area.
Purpose-specific triggers and conditions progress
In the previous release, we introduced purpose-specific triggers and conditions. Instead of thinking in technical state changes, you can now simply pick things like “When a light turns on” or “If the climate is heating” when building your automations.
This feature is still being refined in Home Assistant Labs, but this release adds a lot more trigger types, making this new approach even more useful. Here is an overview of all the new triggers added in this release:
Button triggers fire when a button entity has been pressed.
Climate triggers now cover all common scenarios. You can trigger on HVAC mode changes, target temperature changes, or when the target temperature crosses a threshold. There are also triggers for current temperature and humidity changes, and even target humidity changes.
Device tracker triggers let you automate based on when a device entered or left home, with support for the first device arriving, last device leaving, or any change. Don’t worry, person-specific triggers are coming soon, the device tracker ones were simply available sooner.
Humidifier triggers will fire when a humidifier turns on or off, starts humidifying, or starts drying. You can also trigger on humidity changes or when humidity crosses a threshold.
Light triggers let you automate based on brightness changes or when brightness crosses a specific threshold.
Lock triggers can now fire when a lock is locked, unlocked, opened, or jammed.
Scene triggers fire when a scene is activated.
Siren triggers fire when sirens are turned on or off.
Update trigger fires when an update becomes available.
As the new purpose-specific triggers and conditions all support targeting something bigger than a simple entity (an area, a floor, or even a label), we also redesigned how the target gets displayed on the automation flow.
The goal of this change is to allow you to quickly glance at your automation, and understand its purpose.
Head over to Settings &gt; System &gt; Labs to enable purpose-specific triggers and conditions and give them a try!
Easier navigation to protocol dashboards
For an organization that loves the open standards that seamlessly connect our devices, we sure didn’t promote them enough! Most people didn’t even know that Home Assistant has dedicated dashboards for protocols like Zigbee, Z-Wave, and more.
This release reorganizes the Settings page to give these open protocols a more prominent spot. The protocols section now appears right after the core settings, making it much easier to find all the different ways you’re connecting your devices and quickly access some very useful protocol-specific configurations.
The menu items only appear when you have the corresponding integration set up, so you’ll only see what’s relevant to your setup.

      <description><![CDATA[Home Assistant 2025.11! November is here, and we’ve been hard at work refining some of the main experiences that you interact with every day, and I think you’re going to love what we’ve built.
My personal favorite this release? The brand new target picker. It’s one of those changes that seems simple on the surface, but makes such a huge difference in how you build automations. You can finally see exactly what you’re targeting, with full context about which device an entity belongs to and which area it’s in. No more guessing whether you’re controlling the right ceiling light when you have three of them!
But that’s just the beginning. We’re continuing with the automation editor improvements, this time with a completely redesigned dialog for adding triggers, conditions, and actions. It’s cleaner, easier to read, and sets the foundation for some really exciting stuff coming in future releases. And speaking of making things clearer, you can now control exactly how entity names appear on your dashboard cards. Want to show just the entity name? The device name? The area? Or combine them? Even if you rename things, your dashboards will stay perfectly in sync. No more manual updates needed!
Oh, and energy dashboard fans will appreciate the new pie chart view for device energy, complete with totals displayed in the corner of every energy card. Enjoy the release!

All changes
A huge thank you to all the contributors who made this release possible! And a special shout-out to @bramkragten, @JLo, @MindFreeze, @agners, and @piitaya who helped write the release notes this release. Also, @silamon and @GemPolisher for putting effort into tweaking its contents. Thanks to them, these release notes are in great shape. A brand new target picker
Have you ever been building an automation and wondered, “Wait, which ceiling light is this?” when you see three entities all named “Ceiling light”? Or tried to figure out how many lights you’re actually controlling when you target an entire floor or area?
We’ve all been there. Until now, the target picker didn’t show you the full picture. You couldn’t see which device an entity belonged to or which area it was assigned to. And when you selected a floor or area as your target, you had no idea how many entities you were actually affecting. This uncertainty meant many of you stuck with targeting individual entities, even though larger targets (like areas and floors) can make your automations much more flexible.
The new target picker changes all that. Now you get full context for everything you’re targeting, and you can see exactly how many entities will be affected by your action.
Want to dig deeper? You can expand any floor, area, or device to see exactly which entities are included and where they’re coming from.
This makes it so much easier to build automations that scale with your home. When you target an area or floor, your automation automatically adapts as you add or remove devices. No more updating your automations every time you add a new light or sensor. Your automations just work, which is exactly how it should be.
A brand new way to add triggers, conditions, and actions in your automations
It’s no secret that we’re currently working hard on making automations easier to create. After the release of the automation sidebar two releases ago, we are now introducing a new dialog to add triggers, conditions, and actions.
The changes are purely cosmetic: the dialog is bigger, so the description of each block is simpler to read, with a two-pane layout to ease both navigation and block selection.
The building blocks (which are used to perform more complex conditions or sequences of actions, such as repeating actions or branching out your sequence into multiple paths) have been moved into the main dialog on a second tab. There is now a single entry point to add something to an automation instead of two, greatly reducing the number of buttons in complex automations.
As mentioned above, these changes are purely cosmetic, for now! But this new dialog is the foundation of what’s coming next, and we cannot wait to present that to you once it finally lands.
Naming entities on your dashboard
A few releases ago, we gave the entity picker a big upgrade by adding more context so you could easily see where each entity belongs (May 2025 release). In this release, we’re bringing that same flexibility to your dashboards.
You can now choose how names appear on your cards: show the entity, device, area, floor, or even combine them. This gives you full control over how your dashboards look and feel. For example, in a dedicated section for a specific device, you might choose to display only the entity name to avoid repeating the device name on every card.
Of course, you can still set a custom name if you want complete control over the text shown.
And the best part? If you rename an entity or device, your dashboards will automatically stay in sync. No more manual edits needed; everything just updates itself.
Energy pie
We’ve added a new layout to the devices energy graph: “pie” . You can toggle between the regular bar chart and the new pie chart by clicking the icon in the top-right corner.
Doing this made the top-right corner of the other energy cards feel empty, so we used that space to display the total energy for the selected period. For example, if the date picker is set to today, the total solar energy for today will be displayed in the corner of the solar production graph card.
Progress for Home Assistant and Add-on updates
With this release, you can now track the progress of updates to Home Assistant and Add-ons (managed by the Supervisor)! The progress includes the stages of downloading and unpacking, so the time required will vary based on your internet speed, CPU performance, and system load. As a result, the progress is not reflected as perfectly linear, but it does still provide a good estimate of how far along the update is.

      <title><![CDATA[Building the AI-powered local smart home]]></title>
      <link>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/09/11/ai-in-home-assistant/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Last year, we laid out our vision for AI in the smart home, which opened up experimentation with AI in Home Assistant. In that update, we made it easier to integrate all sorts of local and cloud AI tools, and provided ways to use them to control and automate your home. A year has passed, a lot has happened in the AI space, and our community has made sure that Home Assistant has stayed at the frontier.
We beat big tech to the punch; we were the first to make AI useful in the home. We did it by giving our community complete control over how and when they use AI, making AI a powerful tool to use in the home. As opposed to something that takes over your home. Our community is taking advantage of AI’s unique abilities (for instance, its image recognition or summarizing skills), while having the ability to exclude it from mission-critical things they’d prefer it not to handle. Best of all, this can all be run locally, without any data leaving your home!
Moreover, if users don’t want AI in their homes, that’s their choice, and they can choose not to enable any of these features. I hope to see big tech take an approach this measured, but judging by their last couple of keynotes, I’m not holding my breath.
Over the past year, we’ve added many new AI features and made them easy to use directly through Home Assistant’s user interface. We have kept up with all the developments in AI land and are using the latest standard to integrate more models and tools than ever before. We’re also continuing to benchmark local and cloud models to give users an idea of what works best. Keep reading to check out everything new, and maybe you can teach your smart home some cool new tricks. Local AI is making the home very natural to control Big thanks to our AI community contributor team:
@AllenPorter, @shulyaka, @tronikos, @IvanLH, @Joostlek!
Supercharging voice control with AI
We were doing voice assistants before AI was cool. In 2023, we kicked off our Year of the Voice. Since then, we’ve worked towards our goal of building all the parts needed for a local, open, and private voice assistant. When AI became the rage, we were quick to integrate it.
Today, users can chat with any large language model (LLM) that is integrated into Home Assistant, whether that’s in the cloud or run locally via a service like Ollama. Where Assist, our home-grown (non-AI) voice assistant agent, is focused on a predetermined list of mostly home control commands, AI allows you to ask more open-ended questions. Summarize what’s happening across the smart home sensors you’ve exposed to Assist, or get answers to trivia questions. You can even give your LLM a personality!
Users can also leverage the power of AI to speak the way they speak, as LLMs are much better at understanding the intent behind the words. By default, Assist will handle commands first. Only questions or commands it can’t understand will be sent to the AI you’ve set up. For instance, “Turn on the kitchen light” can be handled by Assist, while “It’s dark in the kitchen, can you help?” could be processed by an AI. This speeds up response times for simple commands and makes for a more sustainable voice assistant.
Another powerful addition from the past year is context sharing between agents. So your Assist agent can share the most recent commands with your chosen AI agent. This shared context lets you say something like “Add milk to my shopping list,” which Assist will act on, and to add more items, just say “Add rice.” The AI agent understands that these commands are connected and can act accordingly. Here is an excellent walkthrough video of JLo's AI-powered home, showing many of these new features in action Another helpful addition keeps the conversation going; if the LLM asks you a question, your Assist hardware will listen for your reply. If you say something like “It’s dark”, it might ask whether you’d like to turn on some lights, and you could tell it to proceed. We have taken this even further than other voice assistants, as you can now have Home Assistant initiate conversations. For example, you could set up an automation that detects when the garage door is open and asks if you’d like to close it (though this can also be done without AI with a very clever Blueprint).
AI pushed us to completely revamp our Text-to-Speech (TTS) system to take advantage of streaming responses from LLMs. While local AI models can be slow, we use a simple trick to make the delay almost unnoticeable. Now, both Piper (our local TTS) and Home Assistant Cloud TTS can begin generating audio as soon as the LLM produces the first few words, improving the speed of the spoken response by a factor of ten.
Prompt: “Tell me a long story about a frog”
Setup
Time to start speaking Cloud, non-streaming
6.62 sec Cloud, streaming
0.51 sec (13x faster) Piper, non-streaming
5.31 sec Piper, streaming
0.56 sec (9.5x faster) Ollama gemma3:4b on an RTX 3090, and Piper on an i5
Great hardware to work with AI
People built some really cool voice hardware, from landline telephones to little talking robots, but the fact that it was so DIY was always a barrier to entry. To make our voice assistant available to everyone, we released the Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition. This is an easy and affordable way to try Home Assistant Voice. It has some seriously powerful audio processing hardware inside its sleek package. If you were on the fence about trying out voice, it really is the best way to get started.
It’s now easier than ever to set up your Assist hardware to work with LLMs with our Voice Assistants settings page, and you can even assign a different LLM to each device. The LLM can recognize the room it’s in and the devices within it, making its responses more relevant. Assist was built to be a great way to control devices in your home, but with AI, it becomes so much more.
AI-powered suggestions
Last month, Home Assistant launched a new opt-in feature to leverage the power of AI when automating with Home Assistant. The goal is to shorten the journey from a blank slate to your finished idea.
When saving an automation or script, users can now leverage the new Suggest button: When clicked, it will send your automation configuration along with the titles of your existing automations and labels to AI to suggest a name, description, category, and labels for your new automation. Over the coming months, we’re going to explore what other features can benefit from AI suggestions.
To opt-in to this feature, you need to take two steps. First, you need to configure an integration that provides an AI Tasks entity. For local AI, you can configure Ollama, or you can also leverage cloud-based AI like Google, OpenAI, or Anthropic. Once configured, you need to go to the new AI Task preferences pane under System -&gt; General and pick the AI Task entity to power suggestions in the UI. If you don’t configure an AI Tasks entity, the Suggest button will not be visible.
AI Tasks gets the job done
Enabling AI Tasks does more than quickly label and summarize your automations; its true superpower is making AI easy to use in templates, scripts, and automations. AI Tasks allow other code to leverage AI to generate data, including options to attach files and define how you want that data output (for instance, a JSON schema).
We have all seen those incredible community creations, where a user leverages AI image recognition and analysis to detect available parking spots or count the number of chickens in the chicken coop. It’s likely that AI Tasks can now help you easily do this in Home Assistant, without the need for complex scripts, extra add-ons, or HACS integrations.
Below is a template entity that counts chickens in a video feed, all via a short and simple set of instructions. template: - triggers: - trigger: homeassistant event: start - trigger: time_pattern minutes: "/5" actions: - action: ai_task.generate_data data: task_name: Count chickens instructions: &gt;- This is the inside of my coop.]]></description>

      <link>https://github.com/genielabs/HomeGenie/releases/tag/v2.0.7</link>
      <description><![CDATA[HomeGenie v2.0.7 - AI Vision &amp; Integrated NVR
Welcome to HomeGenie 2.0.7! This major update transforms your smart home setup into a cutting-edge, AI-powered video surveillance platform. We've completely rewritten how HomeGenie handles cameras and added a built-in Network Video Recorder (NVR) that works seamlessly with our newest Artificial Intelligence models.
Here is what’s new: Smarter, Faster AI
Next-Gen Object Detection: We have upgraded our AI engine to support YOLO26, the absolute latest generation of AI vision models. It is faster, more accurate, and catches details like never before.
Smarter Text Processing: The underlying LLamaSharp engine has been updated, making text-based automations and local LLM processing snappier.
Total Performance Control: Worried about AI using all your CPU/GPU? You can now set a "Max Requests Per Second" limit on Object Detection, Pose Estimation, and Segmentation. Your system stays perfectly responsive while still catching all the action. The "AI Vision Hub" Dashboard
Keep an eye on everything at once. We've introduced the AI Vision Hub, a brand-new dashboard tailored for security. You can pin up to 5 live camera feeds side-by-side, watching real-time AI bounding boxes and detections directly on the video streams. Built-in Smart NVR (Network Video Recorder)
You no longer need third-party software to record your cameras. HomeGenie now includes a highly optimized, enterprise-grade NVR system out of the box.
AI-Triggered Recording: Why record hours of empty rooms? HomeGenie’s NVR talks directly to the AI engine. You can set it to record only when a specific object (like a person or a car) is detected, saving massive amounts of disk space. Continuous recording is also available.
Ultra-Efficient Saving: If your camera supports standard video streams, HomeGenie saves the footage without re-encoding it. This means you can record dozens of HD cameras even on low-power devices like a Raspberry Pi without breaking a sweat.
Makes "Dumb" Cameras Smart: Got a cheap camera that only provides static JPEG snapshots? HomeGenie automatically stitches those images together in the background, turning them into a smooth, live video stream for your dashboards.
Beautiful Playback &amp; Organization: All recordings are neatly organized by day. The interface instantly loads durations, file sizes, and generates smart thumbnails for your clips so you can quickly find the exact moment you are looking for.
Set It and Forget It: Turn on the auto-cleanup feature, and HomeGenie will automatically delete footage older than your specified number of days, ensuring your hard drive never fills up.
Full Changelog: v2.0.6...v2.0.7]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I currently have a 1500 square foot 3 floor home with full wired and wireless network using VLAN’s and Home Assistant docker running on a 24/7 unRaid server. I currently have a number of Kasa WiFi switches and outlets in the system and would like to look at converting to Z-Wave for lighting control but have a couple of complications. There are 3 BLE ceiling fans with integrated lights that I would like to convert to Z-Wave control but haven’t figured out a simple way to accomplish this. I am also wondering if a standalone HA server would be better than running on the unRaid server?

      <link>https://community.gladysassistant.com/t/gladys-assistant-4-69-zigbee2mqtt-passe-sur-ember-et-suivi-energetique-tasmota/10067</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Bonjour à tous,
Une nouvelle version de Gladys Assistant est disponible Voici les nouveautés de cette version :
Zigbee2mqtt : Ajout du nouveau driver Ember
Zigbee2mqtt propose désormais un nouveau driver, Ember, pour certains dongles comme le dongle Sonoff ZBDongle-E par exemple.
L’intégration Zigbee2mqtt dans Gladys vous permet désormais de sélectionner ce driver Ember pour les dongles compatibles.
Si vous utilisez EZSP, Zigbee2mqtt ne touchera pas à votre installation sans action de votre part, pour éviter de casser votre installation. La stabilité est une valeur très importante du projet, et cette mise à jour a été pensé pour ne pas impacter votre quotidien.
Si vous souhaitez passer à Ember, c’est possible, mais il faudra sûrement mettre à jour le firmware de votre dongle Zigbee avant.
Par exemple, pour le Sonoff Dongle-E, l’intégration vous offre la possibilité de sélectionner le driver de votre choix entre « Ember » (le nouveau par défaut), et l’ancien EZSP : Si vous testez le nouveau driver, et que votre firmware n’est pas compatible, pas de panique, vous verrez un message : Vous pourrez alors soit mettre à jour le firmware, soit repartir sur EZSP en attendant.
N’hésitez pas si vous avez des questions Un grand merci à @cicoub13 pour cette contribution !
Dashboard : Amélioration de l’affichage des capteurs d’ouverture de porte
L’affichage des capteurs d’ouverture de porte sur le dashboard a été amélioré pour une meilleure lisibilité.
Désormais, on affiche « Ouvert/Fermé », au lieu de la petite icône de cadenas qui n’était pas très lisible.
Tasmota : Ajout du suivi énergétique
Les appareils Tasmota sont désormais intégrés au suivi de l’énergie.
Merci à @Terdious pour ce développement Pour mettre à jour, c’est automatique, ou vous pouvez forcer la mise à jour dans les paramètres.
Bonne fin de semaine à tous !

Can

Also, on the forum here I found info that I could use just isWeekend in dsl, without Ephemeris
So in that case, would !isWeekend() work to trigger only on the workdays?

      <description><![CDATA[After losing my system...
All of my auto backups where corrupt.
I had to go back to a backup from 2023 - with the new 2025 domoticz.
I've added back in all the new devices, and removed the old switches that are no-longer part of my system...
However - whenever I reset the windows pc that is running domoticz, all my newly added devices disappear, and the old switches come back.
Any ideas?

      <description><![CDATA[Hi all,
I would like to request a new dummy device type in Domoticz for measuring 3-phase voltage.
Currently, we have a dummy device for a 3-phase current (ampere) meter, which works very well. It would be great to have a similar option for voltage, allowing users to input and display voltage values for all three phases.
Thanks for considering!

      <description><![CDATA[Hello,
would it make sense to be able adding any analog values to the graph, not necessarily only related to environment sensors like values?
For example it would be interesting to be combining external temperature and gas consumption for examble.
By the way, what is the set point check box for? I don't have any values there although I do have thermostatic radiator valves with setpoint.

Is there a relation to the (many) latest changes? Are there ways to discover the cause of the problem?

      <description><![CDATA[Hello,
1 - Context
Domoticz V2025.2 (build 17277) running on bookworm
Build Hash fac6d8f
Compile Date 2026-02-26 06:42:05
dzVents Version 3.1.11
Python Version 3.11.2 (main, Apr 28 2025, 14:11:48) [GCC 12.2.0]
2 - How to find domoticz log file
I switched from the deprecated mean to create domoticz service using the /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh file to the preferred one in /etc/systemd/system/domoticz.service.
Previously i recorded domoticz messages in "/var/log/domoticz.log" by setting in domoticz.sh file the line: DAEMON_ARGS="$DAEMON_ARGS -log /var/log/domoticz.log"
Now when using /etc/systemd/system/domoticz.service I see the domoticz messages in domoticz UI but I am not able to find in which file they are stored. I also would like to define the file name supporting these messages.
I would be grateful if someone could help me or give me a hint.

Lorsque j’ai ajouté en zigbee mon interrupteur pour volet roulant, j’aurai aimé que Gladys me propose à ce moment là de configurer ses paramètres de fonctionnement. Par exemple, j’ai un “temps de monté / descente” et le “sens du moteur” à configurer.
Ça serait cool si Gladys pouvait nous faciliter la tâche. Une fois que l’on sait que l’on peut le faire depuis Z2M ça va, mais ça rendrait Gladys plus accessible pour les nouveaux (comme moi)

J’explique… Si je mets mon doigt sur le widget, impossible de faire monter ou descendre la page, ce n’est pas “tactile”.
Est-il possible d’améliorer cela lors de la prochaine amélioration UX ?

      <description><![CDATA[Hi,
I’m trying to upgrade from 5.0.3 to 5.1.3, but the changes to javascript have broken some of my rules and I don’t understand enough to figure it out.
I have been using things like
items.metadata.itemchannellink.replaceItemChannelLink(name, channeluid)
items.getItem(nameofanitem).replaceMetadata(blah blah) and others from Home - openHAB JS
When upgrading to 5.1.3, these rules fail when hitting these parts.
Errors like:
Failed to execute rule systemBuilder-Lights: TypeError: undefined has no such function “replaceItemChannelLink”: TypeError: undefined has no such function “replaceItemChannelLink”
This feels like something to do with the new way things are injected? In the javascript settings page of the openhab UI, it looked like everything was set to automatic, but I don’t really understand what I’m looking at.
Can anyone help?

      <description><![CDATA[Just updated my test system from 2025.2 17252 to 17265 and it fails to restart. Update counter goes all the way to 99 which is unusual. First i thought we had the old issue back again so did a stop and start from cmd line but nothing. Performing a stop and start and then a systemctl status gets me this, but no gui and despite it saying it's started none of my switches work so i'd say it's not actually running.

      <link>https://community.openhab.org/t/oh3-all-timestamps-graphs-30-minutes-behind-real-time/168642</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Hello.
I found out that my OH3 has an delay of 30minutes in all Timestamps like network:ping last seen, in graphs created from values of Modbus (Smartmeter, frequency, Power, U,I) but it shows the correct ntp-time. The Result is that frequency and Powercharts are everytime shown half an hour behind the real local time and it seems OH-internal Timestamps (rrd-recordings) did the same. I checked the regional and ephemerial settings in the UI but i can’t find a misconfigured point.
I need Help to find the point where this could be wrong sat up.
Sorry, Did not write often in english (Germany) and the editor here is much slower as OH on my old Netbook there.

      <link>https://community.openhab.org/t/managing-openhab-rules-like-production-software-testing-automation-and-troubleshooting/168641</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Hi all,
as I’m using openHAB since more than 10 year regressions problems, and troubleshooting after upgrades are well known to me. So - as I tried to leverage AI agents to create a system to create testable rules and widgets - and I’m quite happy with the result. As usual, my time is very limited - especially as I want to finish the Jellyfin binding to make it available to all users (locally it is under testing with 5.1.2) … So I dared to task the AI to describe the setup - not ideal maybe, but I hope it serves as an inspiration on how to achieve a stable setup over time; and preferred to not sharing the idea at all.
Note: There are quite some simplifications in the summary - as the whole container, network setup and AI agent setup is omitted.
with kind regards,
And now I give the word to Claude: Note: This article was automatically generated with AI. The rule modifications, tests, and troubleshooting workflows themselves are developed and refined using AI agents as coding partners. The approach documented here reflects our operational practices, not necessarily universal “best practices.”
Introduction
Home automation rules are complex. They integrate multiple devices, handle edge cases, and run 24/7 with minimal supervision. Yet many openHAB users manage rules the way they manage configuration files—manually, with minimal testing, and with limited visibility into execution.
Our Setup: 90 production rule files, 6 shared library modules, 92 unit tests—all deployed and managed using the testing and deployment pipeline described below.
This article describes our approach: automated regression testing with Jest, system endpoint testing with Puppeteer, live interaction via the openHAB REST API, and interactive troubleshooting with Karaf. Each tool addresses a specific part of the development lifecycle.
Overview: The Rule Development Workflow
Rule Code (JavaScript) ↓ Local Unit Tests (Jest) ↓ System Integration Tests (Puppeteer + REST API) ↓ Deploy to openHAB ↓ Live Troubleshooting (Karaf Console) Each tool serves a specific purpose:
Jest → unit tests catch logic errors before deployment
Puppeteer + REST API → integration tests validate end-to-end behavior
Karaf → interactive debugging when things go wrong
Part 1: Regression Testing with Jest
Jest runs unit tests in milliseconds without requiring an openHAB instance. It handles the core logic layer: parsing, decision-making, state coordination. openHAB injects runtime globals (items, rules, events), so tests mock these to isolate the code under test.

Integration Tests: Testing System Interaction (click for more details)
Setup: Package Configuration
(click for more details)
Testing Approach: Mocking and Isolation
(click for more details) Part 2: End-to-End Testing with REST API and Puppeteer
Integration tests validate the full lifecycle: command → item updates → rule triggers → side effects occur. The REST API and Puppeteer are the test interfaces to a real openHAB instance.
Using the REST API for Integration Tests
The openHAB REST API provides endpoints for items, rules, and logs. From Node.js:
// Get item state
const getItemState = async (itemName) =&gt; { const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:8080/rest/items/${itemName}`); return response.json();
}; // Trigger a rule
const triggerRule = async (ruleUid) =&gt; { return fetch(`http://localhost:8080/rest/rules/${ruleUid}/runnow`, { method: "POST" });
}; These calls simulate what a user’s dashboard or external system would do. They verify rules respond correctly to real events.
Puppeteer for UI Testing
Puppeteer automates a browser to test dashboards and sitemap pages. Key techniques:
page.goto() → navigate to openHAB
page.click() → simulate user interaction
page.waitForFunction() → wait for async state updates
page.$eval() → query and verify DOM content
The pattern is: send a REST command → wait for UI to update → verify the change is visible:
// E2E: Verify UI reflects item state change
await fetch(`http://localhost:8080/rest/items/Light`, { method: "POST", body: "ON"
}); await page.waitForFunction(() =&gt; { const element = document.querySelector("[data-item='Light']"); return element?.textContent.includes("ON");
}); This catches issues that pure API tests miss: slow UI updates, missing bindings, incorrect state formatting.
Part 3: Deployment: Rules vs. Libraries
openHAB rules and shared libraries are deployed using fundamentally different mechanisms. This distinction matters: it affects how you structure code, how you test, and how you troubleshoot.
Architecture: How Tests Feed into Deployment
Before any code reaches openHAB, the deployment system performs comprehensive sanity checks:
Source Code (rules/*.js + metadata, lib/*.js) ↓ [Test Assert] npm test - unit tests, error paths, edge cases ↓ [Sanity Check] Verify GraalVM compatibility (JSDoc + IIFE incompatibility) ↓ [Sanity Check] Verify dependencies exist (all required shared modules) ↓ [Sanity Check] Verify metadata IDs are present (triggers, actions must have IDs) ↓
[Rules] Strip IIFE wrapper + construct REST payload with metadata
[Libs] rsync to node_modules with checksum verification ↓ REST API POST/PUT with proper action/trigger configuration ↓ [Sanity Check] Verify rule status transitions to IDLE (not UNINITIALIZED) ↓ [Production] Enable rule Shared Libraries: rsync Deployment with Verification
Shared libraries (modules in lib/) deploy via rsync to the remote openHAB server’s node_modules directory:
(click for more details)
Rules: IIFE Stripping and REST API Deployment
Rules require transformation:
IIFE wrapper stripped (added for Jest, not needed in openHAB)
Metadata merged (triggers, actions, tags from JSON)
IDs generated for triggers and actions
REST payload constructed with proper structure
GraalVM cache cleared (delete/recreate)
(click for more details)
Metadata Separation and ID Generation (click for more details)
GraalVM Cache Bypass Strategy (click for more details)
Pre-Deployment Sanity Checks
Before any REST API call, the deployment script validates:
Check
Failure Mode Files exist
Obvious error, deployment stops Tests pass
Catch logic errors in Jest before live Dependencies deployed
Missing library → require() fails at runtime Trigger/action IDs present
Missing IDs → rule status UNINITIALIZED Action type is correct
Must be script.ScriptAction, not application/javascript No GraalVM incompatibilities
JSDoc+IIFE pattern → silent execution skip Server responds
API accessible, auth valid Rule reaches IDLE
Indicates successful initialization Example: Missing Dependency Check
# Verify required modules are deployed
for module in openhab-utils alert-tracker multimedia-constants; do if grep -q "require('$module')" rules/012d853fc5.js; then ssh openhab-host ls conf/automation/js/node_modules/$module/index.js || { echo " Module not deployed: $module" exit 1 } fi
done Live Interaction: REST API for Testing and Monitoring
After deployment, the REST API is your window into rule execution:
# Trigger a rule manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/rest/rules/012d853fc5/runnow # Check rule status
curl http://localhost:8080/rest/rules/012d853fc5 | jq '.statusInfo' # List all rules and their status
curl http://localhost:8080/rest/rules | jq '.[] | {uid, name, enabled, statusInfo}' // After stripping: rules/alert-stale-items.js (deployed to openHAB) ("use strict"); const alertTracker = require("alert-tracker");
const { safeGetItem } = require("openhab-utils"); const checkStaleItems = () =&gt; { // ... implementation ...
}; // Direct call (openHAB rule engine triggers this)
checkStaleItems(); How Stripping Works:
The deployment script uses Python regex to detect and remove the IIFE:
Arrow IIFE: ((exports) =&gt; { ... })(...)
Removes the outer wrapper
Removes the inner if (exports) { ... } export block
Replaces the if (typeof event !== "undefined") { runRule(); } guard with direct call
Function IIFE: (function () { ...]]></description>

Depuis hier après-midi mes prises ne remontent plus en temps réel la consommation, voire même elle se fige à une donnée.
Une idée pour résoudre ce problème, s’il vous plaît ? Machine à laver éteinte.

Stupidly - i have no idea what version I had.
But I've updated to the latest version...
2025.2.16812 And i've noticed a device that used to work perfectly with an "off delay" of 1 second.
Now triggers for too long - and no longer works.

      <description><![CDATA[Hello,
"domoticz.email" was working fine until early February. But strangely, no emails have been sent since. I haven't changed any settings. The "Test" function in the settings works correctly. Thinking it might be a problem with my ISP, I changed the email address, but it didn't help.
A Python script on the same Raspberry Pi sends emails correctly using the original address. What's the problem?
Notice that I stay in beta 17099, due to recent problem with the beta versions.
Thank you

      <description><![CDATA[Hi, everyone.
I’m running OH 4.3.1 on a Raspberry Pi (CENTOS 9).
For a while, I haven’t been able to connect to my OH from Visual Studio Code (macOS Tahoe 26.2), but I didn’t need it much before. Now I need it for code completion, but I can’t seem to get it to work. I keep getting the following errors:
openHAB Extension Output
openHAB vscode extension has been activated [Error - 4:14:14 PM] Connection to server is erroring. Shutting down server. [Error - 4:14:14 PM] Connection to server is erroring. Shutting down server.

(Use `Code Helper (Plugin) --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created) Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND openhabianpi at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookupall [as oncomplete] (node:dns:122:26) { errno: -3008, code: 'ENOTFOUND', syscall: 'getaddrinfo', hostname: 'openhabianpi' } OH is running. I can connect via a web browser and via SSH from my Mac’s Terminal.
I have deleted all global (User) connection settings and left only the ones at the Workspace level (.vscode/settings.json), as suggested in VS Code OH5 - Error while connecting to openHAB REST API. I also tried the other way around, with the connection strings in the User configuration, to no avail.
"openhab.connection.host": "10.18.18.102", "openhab.connection.authToken": "oh.VisualStudioCL.a0XXXXXXXXXXXXX”, "openhab.connection.port": 8080 The other settings are not in the textual configuration, and adding them there doesn’t change the outcome. I have checked that the ports are open in the firewall, and that they are listening using TCP
ss -tuln Netid State Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port Peer Address:Port
tcp LISTEN 0 50 *:5007 *:*
tcp LISTEN 0 50 *:8080 *:*
tcp LISTEN 0 128 [::]:22 [::]:*
tcp LISTEN 0 50 *:8443 *:*
On OH, the LSP is listening on the same port: I even deleted the old token and created a new one.
However, I have not configured any ‘openhabianpi’ anywhere, so I don’t know where the LSP is getting that from.
I have restarted VS Code multiple times, as well as deleted the extension and installed it again.
What else am I overlooking?

      <description><![CDATA[Bonjour à tous, dernièrement on a eu quelques soucis avec l’intégration Airplay. La lib utilisée pour se connecter à l’enceinte était un peu vieille, je l’ai forkée pour essayer de la garder à jour et la faire fonctionner avec les dernières versions de Node, mais une grosse partie du code n’est pas propre et ça passait par le binding de fonctions C++ ce qui rendait la maintenance complexe.
nouvelle lib qui fait la même chose en 100% Typescript, j’ai basculé dessus ça fonctionne aussi bien et ça sera plus simple à maintenir plus tard. Si certains utilisateurs Airplay veulent tester une image docker est disponible bertrandda/gladys:airplay.

      <title><![CDATA[Gets gas consumption from the electrical energy of the gas boiler]]></title>
      <link>https://forum.domoticz.com/viewtopic.php?p=331700#p331700</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Hi,
Below I will explain how I managed to obtain an approximate daily gas consumption by transforming the electrical energy consumed by the gas boiler.
The boiler is monitored by a smart plug and I created a custom sensor in domoticz that records daily gas consumption.
To be able to obtain an approximate gas consumption, you must first monitor the consumption on the gas meter for a day. Similarly, you monitor the energy consumption in Kw for that day.
Daily Gas consumption = Daily energy consumption of the gas boiler (in Kilowatt) x Multiplier
Calculate daily consumption smart plug (counterToday in domoticz) x Multiplier, for example in my case the multiplier value is 21 to obtain the approximate gas consumption, but you can also test with other values ​​until it gives the correct result.
Then create the following dzvents script: Code: return {active = true,on = {devices = { 139 } -- idx smart plug},execute = function(domoticz, device)------------------------------------------------------- CONFIGURATION-----------------------------------------------------local MULTIPLICATOR = 21 -- multiplier replace with your own valuelocal GAZ_IDX = 520 -- replace with the idx of your sensor Custom Sensor "Estimated Gas Consumption"---------------------------------------------------------------------- MAIN LOGIC--------------------------------------------------------------------local val = device.counterToday or 0local consumKWh = 0if type(val) == "string" thenconsumKWh = tonumber(val:match("([%d%.]+)")) or 0elseconsumKWh = tonumber(val) or 0endlocal consumGaz = consumKWh * MULTIPLICATORlocal gazDevice = domoticz.devices(GAZ_IDX)if gazDevice thengazDevice.updateCustomSensor(consumGaz)domoticz.log(string.format("idx[%d]: %.3f kWh → Gas estimated: %.3f m³ (x%.3f)",device.id, consumKWh, consumGaz, MULTIPLICATOR), domoticz.LOG_INFO)elsedomoticz.log(string.format("Error: we did not find the device with idx %d", GAZ_IDX), domoticz.LOG_ERROR)endend}
LE: in my case only the gas boiler using gas.
I hope it helps you too.

      <description><![CDATA[Hi,
As the title says, I’m currently working on a new theme for personal use. It doesn’t have a name yet.
The theme is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices. All settings are stored in a virtual text device. The blocks can be moved between columns within the same column structure, and columns themselves can also be repositioned.
Column reordering is only available on desktop. On mobile, the layout follows the saved (static) configuration and cannot be rearranged. This is mainly to prevent conflicts with swipe gestures on phones and tablets.
The weather icons dynamically reflect the current conditions. For example, freezing temperatures show an ice icon, rain displays a rain icon, and so on.
Development has only just started, so please don’t ask for a download yet — it’s not finished.
At the moment, it uses a room with favorites, but switching to another room is straightforward and easy to configure via a config file.
It takes all (favorite) devices/sensors automatically from inside the room.
Each block includes an instant update “glow” indicator with a timestamp of the last update, so you can instantly see live activity.
So far i made it as test, but we using it on all phones and tables and it works great.
Still needs work to do, but for what we need, it works excellent.
If you’re interested, let me know. Depending on any feedback or tips, I might take this to the next level and consider sharing it.
Barry

      <description><![CDATA[Hello,
J’aimerais que mon détecteur de présence Zigbee n’allume le salon automatiquement que s’il est déclenché avant le lever du soleil ou après son coucher.
J’ai essayé de faire ça : mais je me dis que faire ça pour chaque jour n’est pas très pratique.
Est-ce que je m’y prends mal ? Y a-t-il une solution plus simple et élégante ?
Merci d’avance

since the update to v2025.2 (build 17186), all my dzvents lua automations are not triggered anymore. For example I see that a switch changes state, but the lua script is not triggered. (Also the CPU is much lower than before the update)
Anybody else seeing the same issue?

This does not work (404 error) (input from browser IP# and port are correct)
Code: http://192.168.2.100:8080/domoticz/json.htm?type=devices
Chatgpt says
Code: Important PointIn the Domoticz Docker image domoticz/domoticz:stable from version 2025.2:The old /json.htm API is not available in this container build.This image is mainly intended for GUI + plugins.Any scripts that try to fetch data via /json.htm will always return 404.So, regardless of roomplan or idx, you cannot use this API.
any idea? chatgpt propose to downgrade to older container which I don't think being a real solution
any suggestions?

I had problems with the USB P1 interface- CRC errors . I changed to a LAN interface. It now records data correctly.
The annual consumption is shown correctly, but the comparison is incorrect. Since the CRC problems start with october 2025, I have incorrect comparisons of october and december. November is shown correctly. The same is for january 2026.
How can i repair data for compared usage.
The same is for Gas and Electricity. Statistics: Posted by nabru99 — Tuesday 17 February 2026 10:12 — Replies 0 — Views 240]]></description>

The actual usage is around 60 m3 and not 600 m3 that is in the graph. To get an idea how the month total is calculated I shift-clicked removed a few day -totals. That did not make a difference in the month total.
My question is: Can the feb month value be corrected by changing Counter -numbers? Without touching the January and March month totals. Probably the '2025-02-03' ? Thanks.

      <description><![CDATA[My "wishlist" for an update of the energy dashboard:
1.
In the settings for the energy dashboard you can define up to three custom widgets that are visually linked to the home consumption bubble on the right hand side. This is fine for consuming device like a heat pump (see screenshot).
But for devices that are producing power it would be more logical to link them to the upper bubble with solar power. In my case, this is the sum of a small + big solar power plant.
2.
And it would be nice if the font size of the text device is bigger (in my case the weather description)

      <description><![CDATA[I have an infraread reading head on my electric meter ("Hichi" with Tasmota). Transfering the data via MQTT to Domotics works, but for at least one of the figures I get this error:

For those of you who are savvy with Tasmota: This is the code of the customized script that runs there and it displays correct data in the Tasmota web interface:

      <description><![CDATA[Home Assistant 2026.2! February is the month of love, and this release is here to share it!
The new Home Dashboard is now the official default for all new installations. If you’ve been using Home Assistant for a while and never customized your default view, you’ll get a suggestion to switch; give it a try!
I also need your help! The Open Home Foundation device database is being built as a community-powered resource to help everyone make informed decisions about smart home devices. Head to Home Assistant Labs to opt in and contribute your anonymized device data. Add-ons are now called Apps! After a lot of community discussion, it was time to use terminology that everyone understands. Your TV has apps, your phone has apps, and now Home Assistant has apps too.
My personal favorite this release? The completely redesigned Quick search! If you’re like me and navigate Home Assistant using your keyboard, you’re going to love this one. Press ⌘ + K (or Ctrl + K on Windows/Linux) and you have instant access to everything. Enjoy the release!

All changes
A huge thank you to all the contributors who made this release possible! And a special shout-out to @laupalombi and @mkerstner who helped write the release notes this release. Also, @wollew, @Diegorro98, and @MindFreeze for putting effort into tweaking its contents. Thanks to them, these release notes are in great shape. A new way to view your home
The Home Dashboard is now Overview as it becomes the official default standard, replacing the old “Overview” for all new instances. If you’re a long-time user who never customized your default view, we’ll suggest the switch to you; otherwise, you can find it in Settings &gt; Dashboards to try it out whenever you’re ready.
Liked the old Overview as a way to build your custom dashboards? You can still do it. Go to Settings &gt; Dashboards, select Create, and pick the Overview (legacy) template.
Discovered devices at a glance
Check out the new card in the For You section! It instantly displays any new devices your Home Assistant has discovered, allowing you to add them on the spot or jump straight to device management without digging through menus.
Area assignments made easy
In the last release, we added a dedicated Devices area within the Home Dashboard to catch everything currently unassigned. Now this section provides quick prompts to help you categorize your devices into the right rooms, keeping your setup organized with minimal effort.
Faster area edits
Need to swap the area temperature sensor? Area pages now feature a shortcut in the Edit button. This lets you jump straight to the area’s configuration to update primary sensors like humidity or temperature in seconds.
We’ve also tidied up the interface by removing awkward empty spaces and fixing issues with some back arrows. Navigating through your sub-menus should now feel as smooth and predictable as you’d expect.
UX and visual upgrades
Modern look in the default theme: We’ve retired the old blue top bar in favor of a clean, consistent theme that matches our Settings page. This distraction-free design lets your cards and data take center stage.
Personalized themes per user: Themes have moved! You can now find and toggle your favorite looks directly within your User profile, making it easier to set up a theme that works for you in any device you are logged in.
Device database: We need your help!
Finding reliable information about smart home devices before you buy them can be challenging. That’s why we’re building the Open Home Foundation device database: a community-powered resource that helps you make informed decisions based on real-world data.
We’ve been working with early contributors to lay the groundwork, and the results are already impressive: over 10,000 unique devices across more than 260 integrations have been submitted by Home Assistant users who opted in to share their anonymized data.
Help us out and share your devices
Since we’re still in the early stages, the device database lives in Home Assistant Labs, where you can opt in to share anonymized information about the devices in your home.
We have also added a new section called Device analytics to Home Assistant Analytics, which shows up when you enable it in Home Assistant Labs. If you opt in, you are, of course, able to opt out at any time.
Privacy is our foundation. We collect zero personal data, period. Only aggregated, anonymized device information is shared if someone chooses to opt in, providing valuable insights while keeping your privacy intact. You can preview what is being sent using the Preview device analytics option available in the top-right corner on the Analytics page. Read our Data Use Statement for complete details.
See the data in action
We’ve launched an initial public dashboard where you can explore aggregated statistics as it grows. This is just our first step. We want to build what comes next together with you.
Join us in building something meaningful
Head to Settings &gt; System &gt; Labs to enable device analytics and start contributing your real-world anonymized device data to help others make better choices.
Read our blog post for more details and join the conversation in our Discord project channel; we’d love to hear your ideas, feedback, and questions as we shape this resource together.
Add-ons are now called Apps
Starting with this release, add-ons are now called apps! You might be wondering: why change the name? The answer comes down to making Home Assistant more approachable for everyone, especially newcomers.
When you first open Home Assistant, you see two sections that sound very similar: “Add-ons” and “Integrations.” Both names imply something you add to extend Home Assistant, but they serve fundamentally different purposes. For those of us who’ve been in the ecosystem for a while, this distinction is second nature. But we keep seeing new users getting confused, attempting to install add-ons when they need integrations, or vice versa.
This is where the rename helps: use terminology that people already understand. Most people know what an “app” is. You open your phone’s app store, you pick an app, you install it. Your TV has an app store. Your NAS has apps. Heck, even some fridges have apps these days. It’s a concept everyone understands. The same mental model now applies to Home Assistant:
Apps are standalone applications that run alongside Home Assistant.
Integrations are connections that connect Home Assistant to your devices and services.
Apps are separate software managed by your Home Assistant Operating System, running next to Home Assistant itself. They can be things like code editors, media servers, MQTT brokers, or database tools. Some apps even pair with integrations: for example, the Mosquitto MQTT broker app provides the service, while the MQTT integration connects Home Assistant to it.
Existing documentation, community posts, and tutorials will continue to reference “add-ons” for some time. Search engines and AI assistants will also need time to catch up.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[HomeGenie Server v2.0.0-rc.14 - The "Agentic Automations" Update This release candidate bridges the gap between conversation and execution, bringing Agentic AI directly into the HomeGenie Scheduler. It enables the system to not only respond to your queries but to reason and act autonomously through recurring, natural language-driven tasks. Lailama: Enhanced Reasoning &amp; Memory Management
The Lailama Local AI engine receives a major architectural update focused on long-term stability and granular control.
Intelligent Memory Pruning: Introduced Max Turns configuration to prevent context bloat. The engine now automatically resets the history after a defined number of turns, ensuring 100% stable performance and preventing the "looping" issues common in long-session LLMs.
Customizable Context Window: Users can now manually adjust the Context Size (n_ctx) via a new slider (up to 8192 tokens), allowing for massive device inventories and complex system reports.
Privacy-First Context Toggle: A new "Include device list" option allows users to decide exactly when to share the home’s status with the AI, optimizing token usage and privacy.
Prompt.Schedule API: A new synchronous API method designed for background tasks, allowing the AI to execute logic without "polluting" the primary chat history. Scheduler 2.0: The "Genie Command"
The Scheduler is no longer just a timer; it’s now an Agentic Host.
Genie Command Preset: Introducing a new preset action that lets you define automations in plain language. Instead of writing code, you can now schedule tasks like: "Check the porch light and set it to a random color different from the last one.", "Set the heat to 22° and start the Sunrise scene"
Enhanced Scripting Host: For power users, the Scheduler now supports the $$.api.call (ApiHelper) method, enabling deep integration between custom scripts and the internal API bus. Security &amp; Core Refactor
Security System 2.0: The Security Alarm System has been refactored into its own dedicated domain: HomeAutomation.SecuritySystem/Main. BREAKING CHANGE: Any manual scripts or widgets referencing the old security module address must be updated to the new fully qualified path.
Energy Monitor: Fixed a minor logic bug in the energy tracking program to improve aggregation accuracy during peak load shifts. UI &amp; UX Refinements
Streamlined Rendering: Fixed a rendering delay in Voice Control messages, ensuring that transcriptions appear instantly as they are processed.
Consistent API Blocks: Improved the rendering of subsequent API blocks in the chat interface, ensuring that complex multi-step AI responses are displayed clearly and remain fully interactive.
Responsive Resize: Further refinements to the chat's drag-to-resize bar for better handling on touch devices and high-DPI screens. IMPORTANT NOTE
This RC is the final stepping stone towards the stable v2.0. We recommend all users on rc.13 to upgrade to test the new Lailama memory management features.
Building the future of local, private, and agentic automation. Enjoy HomeGenie 2.0! Full Changelog: v2.0.0-rc.12...v2.0.0-rc.14]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[More devices, more choice: celebrating a massive year for certification]]></title>
      <link>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/12/09/wwha-2025-recap/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[If you’re ever in need of a device that works great with Home Assistant, well, I have just the program for you. Works with Home Assistant is our certification program that ensures devices work seamlessly and locally, all with brands that back them up.
Did you know that this year the Works with Home Assistant program has certified 12 partners across 12 months? That’s more than were certified in the two years since the program launched in 2022! The full list of devices is insanely long now (luckily, we made it searchable). To make all this happen over just one year, a lot of important things have been happening behind the scenes.
Moving to a non-profit foundation
In August 2024, the Open Home Foundation took over Works with Home Assistant. This helped reinforce that this program is not a commercial venture: it exists solely to connect our users with brands that support the foundation’s core values of privacy, choice, and sustainability.
When we moved it over to the foundation, we also took that chance to beef-up our processes, with robust legal contracts that ensure every partner who joins the program formally commits to things like offering users long-term support and easy updates.
It’s all about the devices
When we started the program we certified brands, but now we certify devices. This means you know exactly which sensors, switches, or other gadgets have been rigorously tested by us to ensure the best experience with Home Assistant. Each certified device has to work locally, without the need for cloud subscriptions or control.
We can now certify in phases, rather than overwhelming our testers with a truckload of devices in order to launch one partner. Also, if a manufacturer has one device that is cloud-controlled, it doesn’t blacklist any remaining items they have that could operate perfectly well locally. It sometimes means that sometimes your favorite devices aren’t part of the first wave of certification but, trust us, the partners check the .
Making it easy to find certified devices
Here’s a conundrum: the more products that are certified, the harder it is for you to see and find them. The good news is I think we’ve cracked it!
Last week, we published the first version of our new searchable certified device list. Previously, you’d have to hunt around for info by checking the integration page or digging through launch blogs to see if a device was certified. Now, certified devices are kept up to date in one central, easy-to-use location, with extra information on the region they’re available in, the protocol we’ve certified them under, and notes about any secondary functionality we’re still working on.
The badge had a makeover
Every certified device earns the right to display our badge on its packaging, proudly announcing it Works with Home Assistant. If you’re not part of the program, you’re not allowed to use the Home Assistant logo. We used to have different versions of the badges depending on whether the device used Matter, Zigbee, or Z-Wave, and so on, but – let’s be honest – they were overcomplicated and impossible to actually read on a box!
Since the badge is such an important signal when you’re browsing products, we decided to simplify it and focus purely on that mark of quality. Now we have just two versions: a color badge and a monochrome design that are easier to read on any packaging.
Companies of all sizes
For 2025, our goal was simple: we wanted both the big names and passionate community projects to be able to join. Yes, we’re thrilled to have major smart home players such as Shelly and Reolink committing to the program, but it’s equally important for us to connect with smaller, community-built projects – the start-ups or developers who keep open source at the heart of everything they do, like AirGradient and Apollo Automation.
This commitment to inclusivity is a big reason why we keep the annual fee for joining the program deliberately low, at only 500 CHF (per partner, not device) per year. We want to ensure being part of Works with Home Assistant is achievable for everyone who shares our vision.
Improving testing
Testing hasn’t always been perfect – we knew we needed to make improvements, and the community has been amazing in helping us find things we need to look at. Like everything we do, we learn as we go, we iterate, and we improve. Previously, everyone was testing in their own way, but now we’ve standardized the way we test and give feedback to partners. This means testing is more consistent, exacting, and able to handle higher volumes – one of the reasons why we’ve been able to increase the number of devices we’ve certified so radically!
A lot of devices that come across our desks don’t pass certification, and it’s often due to organizations not fully understanding the requirements of joining. While this can vary greatly depending on the device and protocol, it was clear we needed to be more transparent. So as well as publishing our Works with Home Assistant Working Group Resolution, we’re also publishing further testing information: this sample testing report for a simple smart plug shows you the process we follow.
Keeping Home Assistant on the bleeding edge
Because we get to see and test new devices in advance, and receive feedback from our certified partners as part of the process, we have a sneak peek into what vendors have in mind for 2026 and beyond. This allows us to look at our product roadmap and see where we need to realign with innovations in the market. By testing today’s devices, we’re guiding tomorrow’s Home Assistant features!
What can be controlled in Home Assistant
A core aim of the program is to ensure all certified devices have their “key functionality” available within Home Assistant. So how do we decide what aspects are controllable in Home Assistant and what doesn’t make the cut?
Key: First, we look at the functionality as a whole. Let’s use a door lock for example. The door should lock and unlock from within Home Assistant. That’s key functionality, get it? Secondary: If the lock also chimes when it locks or unlocks, we think of that as “secondary” functionality. We recommend that the manufacturer has it as an “exposed feature” in Home Assistant, so you can turn it off during quiet hours for example, but it wouldn’t block certification.
We have to look at what’s actually supported by the open standard that we’re testing against too. If a feature is not currently supported by the specification, there’s no way for the manufacturer to actually implement it. This is one of the major challenges in certifying against ‘younger’ specifications such as Matter.
We use our best judgment on this, but we also want your feedback, because everyone has a slightly different point of view, even within our team and testers – so look out for our user research requests, or please share your thoughts in our below!
Connecting with our community
For all this talk of testing, Works with Home Assistant is primarily about people and partnerships! As a foundation, we’re focused on making sure the program stays deeply connected with the community it serves, both online and in person.
We’ve been stepping up our presence at meetups and events around the world, so we can share the latest developments and gather your valuable feedback. From gigantic trade shows like CES in Las Vegas to small, local get-togethers, you can expect to see us there! We also want to do this online, so you can ask partners questions on streams, or in – keep an eye out for more of this in future.
On to 2026
So that was 2025 in a (big) nutshell. As for 2026, we want to kick it off with some wonderful Zigbee partners we’ve been working really hard on – particularly after the awesome launch of Connect ZBT-2. Even though Zigbee is one of the longest-established protocols, it’s actually one of the hardest for us to test and certify because so many devices operate outside the official specification.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[The best gets better - Home Assistant Connect ZBT-2]]></title>
      <link>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/11/19/home-assistant-connect-zbt-2/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The easiest way to start with Zigbee or Thread just got even better, with Home Assistant Connect ZBT-2. This USB adapter plugs into your Home Assistant system and opens up a world of smart device options. Between its precisely tuned antenna and next-generation chip, it’s a big step up for anyone looking to connect Zigbee, Thread, or Matter devices directly to Home Assistant.
For all our Zigbee fans, this might be the best upgrade you’ll make all year. We’ve squeezed every inch out of this technology, giving it the best range, speed, and stability possible. The same can be said for our Thread-heads out there (yeah, I just came up with that cool nickname ), making Matter or ESPHome Thread connections rock-solid. Pick whether to dedicate your Connect ZBT-2 to run a Zigbee or Thread network, and it’ll provide the best experience for that protocol (and if all these names just sound like new streaming services to you, check out our explainer below).
If you’re one of those people still rocking three different hubs, what are you waiting for… another giant server outage to take down your smart home? Ditch those cloud hubs and take back your privacy today. As an added bonus, your devices will likely get more controls, range, and resilience.
Available today starting at $49 and €45 (that’s the MSRP, and pricing will vary by retailer). Designed and built by Nabu Casa and the Open Home Foundation, every purchase helps fund the development of Home Assistant. For quick specs, details, and where to buy, visit our beautiful Home Assistant Connect ZBT-2 page.
What are Zigbee, Thread, and Matter? The short answer is they’re all open standards that let smart devices talk directly to your smart hub of choice, like Home Assistant. We love open standards because they don’t rely on the cloud, which means your devices are fully under your control at home, with no risk of turning into a paperweight if the manufacturer gets bored of paying the server fees. Also, when used with Home Assistant, your smart home data never needs to leave your home, which is always better for privacy.
Zigbee is a wireless standard that’s been a cornerstone of smart home technology for nearly two decades, with thousands of devices from brands like Philips Hue, IKEA, Aqara, Sonoff, frient, and ThirdReality. There’s a good chance you already have some of these devices in your home, and they’ll have their own hubs, which frankly are just taking up extra space, as everything is better connected right to Home Assistant .
Matter is the big new standard – its tech is cutting-edge, and growing really fast. It can use Wi-Fi to talk to devices, but if that device is battery-powered, it’ll probably use Thread instead. Matter devices that use Thread are getting really good, and many are Works with Home Assistant certified, including devices from Nuki, Eve, MotionBlinds, and Aqara.
Whether you set up your Connect ZBT-2 to use Zigbee or Thread, you can’t really go wrong, as both standards have devices for nearly every smart home need. Both give devices great battery life, take some strain off your Wi-Fi, and counterintuitively, the more devices you have, the better the range and stability can be.
Standing on the shoulders of giants
In 2022, we released Home Assistant Connect ZBT-1 (originally called SkyConnect), our first product in the Connect line and first USB adapter. Connect ZBT-1 was designed to be the easiest, most stable way to connect Zigbee devices to Home Assistant. It also came with Thread connectivity support, which was very new at the time. All these years later, it continues to receive software support and is a community favorite.
Sales of Connect ZBT-1 helped fund Home Assistant’s development, and we learned so much that has influenced its next iteration. Alas, as much as we love our little Connect ZBT-1, today we’re saying goodbye. We have now ended production of Connect ZBT-1, but software support will continue. If you’re still using Connect ZBT-1, expect it to keep working far into the future.
If you are looking to upgrade your Zigbee network with a Connect ZBT-2, don’t forget you can continue to use your Connect ZBT-1 as a way to dip your toes into the world of Thread – it’s very easy to switch operating modes.
Upgrading everything
Compared to its predecessor, this version has upgraded everything. First off, we’ve doubled the product number from ZBT-1 to ZBT-2… that’s 2x better already! But there’s definitely more.
Stick with an antenna
First off, to achieve peak performance, we moved away from the small “stick” form factor. Small USB sticks are convenient, but USB ports and nearby electronics can create interference that weakens the signal. With Connect ZBT-1, we using a USB extension cable to keep the adapter away from noise.
With Connect ZBT-2, we’ve designed away this issue. It’s much easier to properly position as it’s now a free-standing antenna and base, which is perfectly tuned for Zigbee and Thread. The larger antenna is not only good at broadcasting to further away devices, but is also good at listening out for faint signals from far away devices. We even optimized the base, which acts as a “ground plane”, boosting the antenna’s performance. It includes a 1.5 m (4.9 ft) USB cable that lets you place it in a good spot to avoid any interference.
Four times the speed
Inside Connect ZBT-2 is the Silicon Labs MG24, an advanced Zigbee/Thread system-on-chip. Compared to the MG21 used in Connect ZBT-1, it brings higher processing power and better sensitivity to weak signals.
We also took the opportunity to quadruple the internal communications speed of the chip – taking the baud rate from 115,200 bps to 460,800 bps. In our testing, we saw consistent improvements in device responsiveness. Don’t expect your devices to turn on four times faster, but you’ll feel the difference when turning on several devices simultaneously.
Built for Home Assistant
It is really easy to take advantage of all this performance, as we always work to make Home Assistant hardware super easy to start with. Just plug in the device via the included cable into a spare USB port on your Home Assistant system, and the setup wizard will guide you through everything. This all works so well because the same people who built Zigbee and Thread into Home Assistant also helped build Connect ZBT-2.
You can start a new Zigbee or Thread network in minutes, or use our improved migration tools to move an existing network over. It’s a very easy upgrade, and most adapters migrate with just a few clicks. Best of all, every Home Assistant user upgrading to new adapters will benefit from these new migration tools. Just another example of how hardware sales help level up our software development.
Compatibility and flexibility
Home Assistant Connect ZBT-2 supports Zigbee 3.0 (and yes, we’re looking at Zigbee 4.0 support as well) and is keeping pace with Thread’s rapid development. We’ve tested it working great with ZHA, zigpy-cli, Zigbee2MQTT, matter.js, and OpenThread Border Router, giving you the flexibility to choose how you manage your network.
If it’s a Zigbee-certified device or Matter-certified device that uses Thread, it should work out of the box. Home Assistant already has one of the widest compatibility lists in the world, and our community continuously expands it with every new release. For brands that support the functionality, there are also Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates for devices.
Just note: Connect ZBT-2 can only use one protocol at a time, meaning you must choose either Zigbee or Thread. We’ve done extensive testing in the past on running both at the same time, and found it just doesn’t work well for a whole list of reasons.
Second-generation power
Our second-generation Connect line products are all about being open and performant, and one addition that fulfills this promise is our inclusion of the ESP32 chip.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Ending production of Home Assistant Yellow]]></title>
      <link>https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2025/10/15/yellow-end-of-life/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Today, we’re announcing that we will no longer be producing Home Assistant Yellow. Rest assured, it will continue to receive software support far into the future.
I’m Carl, Vice President of Commercial at Nabu Casa, the organization that builds and sells official hardware for the Open Home Foundation. I couldn’t be more proud of our hardware achievements over the past 12 months, including Voice Preview Edition and Connect ZWA-2 (including its cool new Wi-Fi and PoE experimental firmware).
Home Assistant Yellow was similarly groundbreaking at launch and helped fund Home Assistant’s development. However, for reasons I’ll explain below, the time has come to end production. This means that if you were considering buying a Home Assistant Yellow, you’ll need to act fast, as stock will not be replenished (check the Order Now button on the Home Assistant Yellow page to see if your local retailer still has stock).
Nabu Casa is now exploring what hardware could replace Home Assistant Yellow, so if you have any suggestions on what we should do next, please tell us in the ! In the meantime, the good news is that there are already plenty of other great ways to run Home Assistant. For example, if you’re looking for hardware that’s both easy to start with and supports the Open Home Foundation, we’d recommend the Home Assistant Green.
A golden era
There is a long yellow brick road that brought us to today. All the way back in 2021, we announced Home Assistant Yellow (originally called Amber). It included some pretty unique features, including its built-in Zigbee or Thread adapter, optional PoE, and overall expandable approach. As it used the Raspberry Pi Compute Module platform, included GPIO, and had an NVMe slot, there were a lot of different ways you could upgrade it over time (including people being able to upgrade from CM4 to CM5, which was quite the speed bump ).
It wasn’t all smooth sailing with Home Assistant Yellow. We essentially launched the device in the middle of the great Pi shortage. It definitely complicated things for a time, but it all eventually stabilized. In late 2023, we launched Home Assistant Green, which became the easiest way to get started with Home Assistant. This new product led us to end the sale of Home Assistant Yellow devices that shipped with a CM4 already installed (called the Home Assistant Yellow Standard), which allowed us to focus the product line on the kit versions.
Home Assistant Green continues to have strong sales, but Home Assistant Yellow sales have been naturally slowing down, as happens a couple of years into any product’s life. This month, it finally reached the point where it no longer made sense to have another production run, which ultimately pushed us to discontinue Home Assistant Yellow.
Technology changes, and small-form-factor computing has always moved fast. For instance, in the early days of Home Assistant, the community’s de facto recommendation was always the most recent Raspberry Pi device, but we’re seeing more people gravitate towards Mini PCs. We’re now exploring what we could build next for our power users, but we’re still some way off, so don’t wait if you need something today.
Software support continues
As long as it’s possible to run Home Assistant on Yellow, we will continue to provide builds. If you want living proof of this commitment, take our first hardware device: Home Assistant Blue. It ended production in 2022, but still receives new builds of Home Assistant, something that shows no signs of changing for a long time. We continue to streamline and make Home Assistant more efficient, as it’s our goal for you to run it on the hardware you have.
Say ‘ellow to the future
I’d just like to take a moment to thank everyone who bought a Home Assistant Yellow over the years, and for all the great feedback you shared with us. We’re sad to say goodbye to our trusty little expandable powerhouse, but it’s had a good run and we’re super proud of how far we’ve come. Also, we’ll soon be announcing the date of our next hardware product (not a computing device… but something very cool nonetheless), so stay tuned!]]></description>

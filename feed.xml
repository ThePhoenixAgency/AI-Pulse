      <link>https://github.com/huggingface/skills</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Hugging Face Skills Hugging Face Skills are definitions for AI/ML tasks like dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like OpenAI Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, Google DeepMind's Gemini CLI, and Cursor. The Skills in this repository follow the standardized format Agent Skill format. How do Skills work? In practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active. [!NOTE] 'Skills' is actually an Anthropic term used within Claude AI and Claude Code and not adopted by other agent tools, but we love it! OpenAI Codex uses an AGENTS.md file to define the instructions for your coding agent. Google Gemini uses 'extensions' to define the instructions for your coding agent in a gemini-extension.json file. This repo is compatible with all of them, and more! [!TIP] If your agent doesn't support skills, you can use agents/AGENTS.md directly as a fallback. Installation Hugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor. Claude Code Register the repository as a plugin marketplace: /plugin marketplace add huggingface/skills To install a skill, run: /plugin install @huggingface/skills For example: /plugin install hugging-face-cli@huggingface/skills Codex Codex will identify the skills via the AGENTS.md file. You can verify the instructions are loaded with: codex --ask-for-approval never "Summarize the current instructions." For more details, see the Codex AGENTS guide. Gemini CLI This repo includes gemini-extension.json to integrate with the Gemini CLI. Install locally: gemini extensions install . --consent or use the GitHub URL: gemini extensions install https://github.com/huggingface/skills.git --consent See Gemini CLI extensions docs for more help. Cursor This repository includes Cursor plugin manifests: .cursor-plugin/plugin.json .mcp.json (configured with the Hugging Face MCP server URL) Install from repository URL (or local checkout) via the Cursor plugin flow. For contributors, regenerate manifests with: ./scripts/publish.sh Skills This repository contains a few skills to get you started. You can also contribute your own skills to the repository. Available skills Name Description Documentation hugging-face-cli Execute Hugging Face Hub operations using the hf CLI. Download models/datasets, upload files, manage repos, and run cloud compute jobs. SKILL.md hugging-face-datasets Create and manage datasets on Hugging Face Hub. Supports initializing repos, defining configs/system prompts, streaming row updates, and SQL-based dataset querying/transformation. SKILL.md hugging-face-evaluation Add and manage evaluation results in Hugging Face model cards. Supports extracting eval tables from README content, importing scores from Artificial Analysis API, and running custom evaluations with vLLM/lighteval. SKILL.md hugging-face-jobs Run compute jobs on Hugging Face infrastructure. Execute Python scripts, manage scheduled jobs, and monitor job status. SKILL.md hugging-face-model-trainer Train or fine-tune language models using TRL on Hugging Face Jobs infrastructure. Covers SFT, DPO, GRPO and reward modeling training methods, plus GGUF conversion for local deployment. Includes hardware selection, cost estimation, Trackio monitoring, and Hub persistence. SKILL.md hugging-face-paper-publisher Publish and manage research papers on Hugging Face Hub. Supports creating paper pages, linking papers to models/datasets, claiming authorship, and generating professional markdown-based research articles. SKILL.md hugging-face-tool-builder Build reusable scripts for Hugging Face API operations. Useful for chaining API calls or automating repeated tasks. SKILL.md hugging-face-trackio Track and visualize ML training experiments with Trackio. Log metrics via Python API and retrieve them via CLI. Supports real-time dashboards synced to HF Spaces. SKILL.md Using skills in your coding agent Once a skill is installed, mention it directly while giving your coding agent instructions: "Use the HF LLM trainer skill to estimate the GPU memory needed for a 70B model run." "Use the HF model evaluation skill to launch run_eval_job.py on the latest checkpoint." "Use the HF dataset creator skill to draft new few-shot classification templates." "Use the HF paper publisher skill to index my arXiv paper and link it to my model." Your coding agent automatically loads the corresponding SKILL.md instructions and helper scripts while it completes the task. Contribute or customize a skill Copy one of the existing skill folders (for example, hf-datasets/) and rename it. Update the new folder's SKILL.md frontmatter: ---
name: my-skill-name
description: Describe what the skill does and when to use it
--- # Skill Title]]></description>

      <link>https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus</link>
      <description><![CDATA[GitNexus: The Zero-Server Code Intelligence Engine - GitNexus is a client-side knowledge graph creator that runs entirely in your browser. Drop in a GitHub repo or ZIP file, and get an interactive knowledge graph wit a built in Graph RAG Agent. Perfect for code exploration GitNexus Building git for agent context. Indexes any codebase into a knowledge graph — every dependency, call chain, cluster, and execution flow — then exposes it through smart tools so AI agents never miss code. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/172685ba-8e54-4ea7-9ad1-e31a3398da72 Like DeepWiki, but deeper. DeepWiki helps you understand code. GitNexus lets you analyze it — because a knowledge graph tracks every relationship, not just descriptions. TL;DR: The Web UI is a quick way to chat with any repo. The CLI + MCP is how you make your AI agent actually reliable — it gives Cursor, Claude Code, and friends a deep architectural view of your codebase so they stop missing dependencies, breaking call chains, and shipping blind edits. Even smaller models get full architectural clarity, making it compete with goliath models. Star History Two Ways to Use GitNexus CLI + MCP Web UI What Index repos locally, connect AI agents via MCP Visual graph explorer + AI chat in browser For Daily development with Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, OpenCode Quick exploration, demos, one-off analysis Scale Full repos, any size Limited by browser memory (~5k files) Install npm install -g gitnexus No install —gitnexus.vercel.app Storage KuzuDB native (fast, persistent) KuzuDB WASM (in-memory, per session) Parsing Tree-sitter native bindings Tree-sitter WASM Privacy Everything local, no network Everything in-browser, no server CLI + MCP ( ) The CLI indexes your repository and runs an MCP server that gives AI agents deep codebase awareness. Quick Start # Index your repo (run from repo root)
npx gitnexus analyze That's it. This indexes the codebase, installs agent skills, registers Claude Code hooks, and creates AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md context files — all in one command. To configure MCP for your editor, run npx gitnexus setup once — or set it up manually below. MCP Setup gitnexus setup auto-detects your editors and writes the correct global MCP config. You only need to run it once. Editor Support Editor MCP Skills Hooks (auto-augment) Support Claude Code Yes Yes Yes (PreToolUse) Full Cursor Yes Yes — MCP + Skills Windsurf Yes — — MCP OpenCode Yes Yes — MCP + Skills Claude Code gets the deepest integration: MCP tools + agent skills + PreToolUse hooks that automatically enrich grep/glob/bash calls with knowledge graph context. If you prefer manual configuration: Claude Code (full support — MCP + skills + hooks): claude mcp add gitnexus -- npx -y gitnexus@latest mcp Cursor (~/.cursor/mcp.json — global, works for all projects): { "mcpServers": { "gitnexus": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "gitnexus@latest", "mcp"] } }
} OpenCode (~/.config/opencode/config.json): { "mcp": { "gitnexus": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "gitnexus@latest", "mcp"] } }
} CLI Commands gitnexus setup # Configure MCP for your editors (one-time)
gitnexus analyze [path] # Index a repository (or update stale index)
gitnexus analyze --force # Force full re-index
gitnexus analyze --skip-embeddings # Skip embedding generation (faster)
gitnexus mcp # Start MCP server (stdio) — serves all indexed repos
gitnexus serve # Start HTTP server for web UI connection
gitnexus list # List all indexed repositories
gitnexus status # Show index status for current repo
gitnexus clean # Delete index for current repo
gitnexus clean --all --force # Delete all indexes
gitnexus wiki [path] # Generate repository wiki from knowledge graph
gitnexus wiki --model # Wiki with custom LLM model (default: gpt-4o-mini)
gitnexus wiki --base-url # Wiki with custom LLM API base URL What Your AI Agent Gets 7 tools exposed via MCP: Tool What It Does repo Param list_repos Discover all indexed repositories — query Process-grouped hybrid search (BM25 + semantic + RRF) Optional context 360-degree symbol view — categorized refs, process participation Optional impact Blast radius analysis with depth grouping and confidence Optional detect_changes Git-diff impact — maps changed lines to affected processes Optional rename Multi-file coordinated rename with graph + text search Optional cypher Raw Cypher graph queries Optional When only one repo is indexed, the repo parameter is optional. With multiple repos, specify which one: query({query: "auth", repo: "my-app"}). Resources for instant context: Resource Purpose gitnexus://repos List all indexed repositories (read this first) gitnexus://repo/{name}/context Codebase stats, staleness check, and available tools gitnexus://repo/{name}/clusters All functional clusters with cohesion scores gitnexus://repo/{name}/cluster/{name} Cluster members and details gitnexus://repo/{name}/processes All execution flows gitnexus://repo/{name}/process/{name} Full process trace with steps gitnexus://repo/{name}/schema Graph schema for Cypher queries 2 MCP prompts for guided workflows: Prompt What It Does detect_impact Pre-commit change analysis — scope, affected processes, risk level generate_map Architecture documentation from the knowledge graph with mermaid diagrams 4 agent skills installed to .claude/skills/ automatically: Exploring — Navigate unfamiliar code using the knowledge graph Debugging — Trace bugs through call chains Impact Analysis — Analyze blast radius before changes Refactoring — Plan safe refactors using dependency mapping Multi-Repo MCP Architecture GitNexus uses a global registry so one MCP server can serve multiple indexed repos. No per-project MCP config needed — set it up once and it works everywhere. flowchart TD subgraph CLI [CLI Commands] Setup["gitnexus setup"] Analyze["gitnexus analyze"] Clean["gitnexus clean"] List["gitnexus list"] end subgraph Registry ["~/.gitnexus/"] RegFile["registry.json"] end subgraph Repos [Project Repos] RepoA[".gitnexus/ in repo A"] RepoB[".gitnexus/ in repo B"] end subgraph MCP [MCP Server] Server["server.ts"] Backend["LocalBackend"] Pool["Connection Pool"] ConnA["KuzuDB conn A"] ConnB["KuzuDB conn B"] end Setup --&gt;|"writes global MCP config"| CursorConfig["~/.cursor/mcp.json"] Analyze --&gt;|"registers repo"| RegFile Analyze --&gt;|"stores index"| RepoA Clean --&gt;|"unregisters repo"| RegFile List --&gt;|"reads"| RegFile Server --&gt;|"reads registry"| RegFile Server --&gt; Backend Backend --&gt; Pool Pool --&gt;|"lazy open"| ConnA Pool --&gt;|"lazy open"| ConnB ConnA --&gt;|"queries"| RepoA ConnB --&gt;|"queries"| RepoB How it works: Each gitnexus analyze stores the index in .gitnexus/ inside the repo (portable, gitignored) and registers a pointer in ~/.gitnexus/registry.json. When an AI agent starts, the MCP server reads the registry and can serve any indexed repo. KuzuDB connections are opened lazily on first query and evicted after 5 minutes of inactivity (max 5 concurrent). If only one repo is indexed, the repo parameter is optional on all tools — agents don't need to change anything. Web UI (browser-based) A fully client-side graph explorer and AI chat. No server, no install — your code never leaves the browser. Try it now: gitnexus.vercel.app — drag &amp; drop a ZIP and start exploring. Or run locally: git clone https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/gitnexus.git
cd gitnexus/gitnexus-web
npm install
npm run dev The web UI uses the same indexing pipeline as the CLI but runs entirely in WebAssembly (Tree-sitter WASM, KuzuDB WASM, in-browser embeddings). It's great for quick exploration but limited by browser memory for larger repos. The Problem GitNexus Solves Tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Cline, Roo Code, and Windsurf are powerful — but they don't truly know your codebase structure. What happens: AI edits UserService.validate() Doesn't know 47 functions depend on its return type Breaking changes ship Traditional Graph RAG vs GitNexus Traditional approaches give the LLM raw graph edges and hope it explores enough.

Here are the key components: Core Services Frontend UI: React-based web interface with TypeScript for type safety Backend API: Go-based REST and GraphQL APIs with Bearer token authentication for programmatic access Vector Store: PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search and memory storage Task Queue: Async task processing system for reliable operation AI Agent: Multi-agent system with specialized roles for efficient testing Knowledge Graph Graphiti: Knowledge graph API for semantic relationship tracking and contextual understanding Neo4j: Graph database for storing and querying relationships between entities, actions, and outcomes Automatic capturing of agent responses and tool executions for building comprehensive knowledge base Monitoring Stack OpenTelemetry: Unified observability data collection and correlation Grafana: Real-time visualization and alerting dashboards VictoriaMetrics: High-performance time-series metrics storage Jaeger: End-to-end distributed tracing for debugging Loki: Scalable log aggregation and analysis Analytics Platform Langfuse: Advanced LLM observability and performance analytics ClickHouse: Column-oriented analytics data warehouse Redis: High-speed caching and rate limiting MinIO: S3-compatible object storage for artifacts Security Tools Web Scraper: Isolated browser environment for safe web interaction Pentesting Tools: Comprehensive suite of 20+ professional security tools Sandboxed Execution: All operations run in isolated containers Memory Systems Long-term Memory: Persistent storage of knowledge and experiences Working Memory: Active context and goals for current operations Episodic Memory: Historical actions and success patterns Knowledge Base: Structured domain expertise and tool capabilities Context Management: Intelligently manages growing LLM context windows using chain summarization The system uses Docker containers for isolation and easy deployment, with separate networks for core services, monitoring, and analytics to ensure proper security boundaries. Each component is designed to scale horizontally and can be configured for high availability in production environments. Quick Start System Requirements Docker and Docker Compose Minimum 2 vCPU Minimum 4GB RAM 20GB free disk space Internet access for downloading images and updates Using Installer ( ) PentAGI provides an interactive installer with a terminal-based UI for streamlined configuration and deployment. The installer guides you through system checks, LLM provider setup, search engine configuration, and security hardening. Supported Platforms: Linux: amd64 download | arm64 download Windows: amd64 download macOS: amd64 (Intel) download | arm64 (M-series) download Quick Installation (Linux amd64): # Create installation directory
mkdir -p pentagi &amp;&amp; cd pentagi # Download installer
wget -O installer.zip https://pentagi.com/downloads/linux/amd64/installer-latest.zip # Extract
unzip installer.zip # Run interactive installer
./installer Prerequisites &amp; Permissions: The installer requires appropriate privileges to interact with the Docker API for proper operation. By default, it uses the Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) which requires either: Option 1 ( for production): Run the installer as root: sudo ./installer Option 2 (Development environments): Grant your user access to the Docker socket by adding them to the docker group: # Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER # Log out and log back in, or activate the group immediately
newgrp docker # Verify Docker access (should run without sudo)
docker ps Security Note: Adding a user to the docker group grants root-equivalent privileges. Only do this for trusted users in controlled environments. For production deployments, consider using rootless Docker mode or running the installer with sudo. The installer will: System Checks: Verify Docker, network connectivity, and system requirements Environment Setup: Create and configure .env file with optimal defaults Provider Configuration: Set up LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Ollama, Custom) Search Engines: Configure DuckDuckGo, Google, Tavily, Traversaal, Perplexity, Searxng Security Hardening: Generate secure credentials and configure SSL certificates Deployment: Start PentAGI with docker-compose For Production &amp; Enhanced Security: For production deployments or security-sensitive environments, we strongly recommend using a distributed two-node architecture where worker operations are isolated on a separate server. This prevents untrusted code execution and network access issues on your main system. See detailed guide: Worker Node Setup The two-node setup provides: Isolated Execution: Worker containers run on dedicated hardware Network Isolation: Separate network boundaries for penetration testing Security Boundaries: Docker-in-Docker with TLS authentication OOB Attack Support: Dedicated port ranges for out-of-band techniques Manual Installation Create a working directory or clone the repository: mkdir pentagi &amp;&amp; cd pentagi Copy .env.example to .env or download it: curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxcontrol/pentagi/master/.env.example Touch examples files (example.custom.provider.yml, example.ollama.provider.yml) or download it: curl -o example.custom.provider.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxcontrol/pentagi/master/examples/configs/custom-openai.provider.yml

Security related environment variables Main Security Settings COOKIE_SIGNING_SALT - Salt for cookie signing, change to random value PUBLIC_URL - Public URL of your server (eg. https://pentagi.example.com) SERVER_SSL_CRT and SERVER_SSL_KEY - Custom paths to your existing SSL certificate and key for HTTPS (these paths should be used in the docker-compose.yml file to mount as volumes) Scraper Access SCRAPER_PUBLIC_URL - Public URL for scraper if you want to use different scraper server for public URLs SCRAPER_PRIVATE_URL - Private URL for scraper (local scraper server in docker-compose.yml file to access it to local URLs) Access Credentials PENTAGI_POSTGRES_USER and PENTAGI_POSTGRES_PASSWORD - PostgreSQL credentials NEO4J_USER and NEO4J_PASSWORD - Neo4j credentials (for Graphiti knowledge graph) Remove all inline from .env file if you want to use it in VSCode or other IDEs as a envFile option: perl -i -pe 's/\s+#.*$//' .env Run the PentAGI stack: curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxcontrol/pentagi/master/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d Visit localhost:8443 to access PentAGI Web UI (default is admin@pentagi.com / admin) [!NOTE] If you caught an error about pentagi-network or observability-network or langfuse-network you need to run docker-compose.yml firstly to create these networks and after that run docker-compose-langfuse.yml, docker-compose-graphiti.yml, and docker-compose-observability.yml to use Langfuse, Graphiti, and Observability services. You have to set at least one Language Model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, AWS Bedrock, or Ollama) to use PentAGI. AWS Bedrock provides enterprise-grade access to multiple foundation models from leading AI companies, while Ollama provides zero-cost local inference if you have sufficient computational resources. Additional API keys for search engines are optional but for better results. LLM_SERVER_* environment variables are experimental feature and will be changed in the future. Right now you can use them to specify custom LLM server URL and one model for all agent types. PROXY_URL is a global proxy URL for all LLM providers and external search systems. You can use it for isolation from external networks. The docker-compose.yml file runs the PentAGI service as root user because it needs access to docker.sock for container management. If you're using TCP/IP network connection to Docker instead of socket file, you can remove root privileges and use the default pentagi user for better security. Assistant Configuration PentAGI allows you to configure default behavior for assistants: Variable Default Description ASSISTANT_USE_AGENTS false Controls the default value for agent usage when creating new assistants The ASSISTANT_USE_AGENTS setting affects the initial state of the "Use Agents" toggle when creating a new assistant in the UI: false (default): New assistants are created with agent delegation disabled by default true: New assistants are created with agent delegation enabled by default Note that users can always override this setting by toggling the "Use Agents" button in the UI when creating or editing an assistant. This environment variable only controls the initial default state. API Access PentAGI provides comprehensive programmatic access through both REST and GraphQL APIs, allowing you to integrate penetration testing workflows into your automation pipelines, CI/CD processes, and custom applications. Generating API Tokens API tokens are managed through the PentAGI web interface: Navigate to Settings → API Tokens in the web UI Click Create Token to generate a new API token Configure token properties: Name (optional): A descriptive name for the token Expiration Date: When the token will expire (minimum 1 minute, maximum 3 years) Click Create and copy the token immediately - it will only be shown once for security reasons Use the token as a Bearer token in your API requests Each token is associated with your user account and inherits your role's permissions. Using API Tokens Include the API token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests: # GraphQL API example
curl -X POST https://your-pentagi-instance:8443/api/v1/graphql \ -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{"query": "{ flows { id title status } }"}' # REST API example

console.log('Created flow:', flow); // List all flows
const flows = await client.getFlows();
console.log(`Total flows: ${flows.length}`); Security Best Practices When working with API tokens: Never commit tokens to version control - use environment variables or secrets management Rotate tokens regularly - set appropriate expiration dates and create new tokens periodically Use separate tokens for different applications - makes it easier to revoke access if needed Monitor token usage - review API token activity in the Settings page Revoke unused tokens - disable or delete tokens that are no longer needed Use HTTPS only - never send API tokens over unencrypted connections Token Management View tokens: See all your active tokens in Settings → API Tokens Edit tokens: Update token names or revoke tokens Delete tokens: Permanently remove tokens (this action cannot be undone) Token ID: Each token has a unique ID that can be copied for reference The token list shows: Token name (if provided) Token ID (unique identifier) Status (active/revoked/expired) Creation date Expiration date Custom LLM Provider Configuration When using custom LLM providers with the LLM_SERVER_* variables, you can fine-tune the reasoning format used in requests: Variable Default Description LLM_SERVER_URL Base URL for the custom LLM API endpoint LLM_SERVER_KEY API key for the custom LLM provider LLM_SERVER_MODEL Default model to use (can be overridden in provider config) LLM_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH Path to the YAML configuration file for agent-specific models LLM_SERVER_PROVIDER Provider name prefix for model names (e.g., openrouter, deepseek for LiteLLM proxy) LLM_SERVER_LEGACY_REASONING false Controls reasoning format in API requests LLM_SERVER_PRESERVE_REASONING false Preserve reasoning content in multi-turn conversations (required by some providers) The LLM_SERVER_PROVIDER setting is particularly useful when using LiteLLM proxy, which adds a provider prefix to model names. For example, when connecting to Moonshot API through LiteLLM, models like kimi-2.5 become moonshot/kimi-2.5. By setting LLM_SERVER_PROVIDER=moonshot, you can use the same provider configuration file for both direct API access and LiteLLM proxy access without modifications. The LLM_SERVER_LEGACY_REASONING setting affects how reasoning parameters are sent to the LLM: false (default): Uses modern format where reasoning is sent as a structured object with max_tokens parameter true: Uses legacy format with string-based reasoning_effort parameter This setting is important when working with different LLM providers as they may expect different reasoning formats in their API requests. If you encounter reasoning-related errors with custom providers, try changing this setting. The LLM_SERVER_PRESERVE_REASONING setting controls whether reasoning content is preserved in multi-turn conversations: false (default): Reasoning content is not preserved in conversation history true: Reasoning content is preserved and sent in subsequent API calls This setting is required by some LLM providers (e.g., Moonshot) that return errors like "thinking is enabled but reasoning_content is missing in assistant tool call message" when reasoning content is not included in multi-turn conversations. Enable this setting if your provider requires reasoning content to be preserved. Local LLM Provider Configuration PentAGI supports Ollama for local LLM inference, providing zero-cost operation and enhanced privacy: Variable Default Description OLLAMA_SERVER_URL URL of your Ollama server OLLAMA_SERVER_MODEL llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0 Default model for inference OLLAMA_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH Path to custom agent configuration file OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_TIMEOUT 600 Timeout for model downloads (seconds) OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_ENABLED false Auto-download models on startup OLLAMA_SERVER_LOAD_MODELS_ENABLED false Query server for available models Configuration examples: # Basic Ollama setup with default model
OLLAMA_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_SERVER_MODEL=llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0 # Production setup with auto-pull and model discovery
OLLAMA_SERVER_URL=http://ollama-server:11434
OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_ENABLED=true
OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_TIMEOUT=900
OLLAMA_SERVER_LOAD_MODELS_ENABLED=true # Custom configuration with agent-specific models
OLLAMA_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/ollama-config.yml # Default configuration file inside docker container
OLLAMA_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/pentagi/conf/ollama-llama318b.provider.yml Performance Considerations: Model Discovery (OLLAMA_SERVER_LOAD_MODELS_ENABLED=true): Adds 1-2s startup latency querying Ollama API Auto-pull (OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_ENABLED=true): First startup may take several minutes downloading models Pull timeout (OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_TIMEOUT=900): 15 minutes in seconds Static Config: Disable both flags and specify models in config file for fastest startup Creating Custom Ollama Models with Extended Context PentAGI requires models with larger context windows than the default Ollama configurations. You need to create custom models with increased num_ctx parameter through Modelfiles. While typical agent workflows consume around 64K tokens, PentAGI uses 110K context size for safety margin and handling complex penetration testing scenarios. Important: The num_ctx parameter can only be set during model creation via Modelfile - it cannot be changed after model creation or overridden at runtime. Example: Qwen3 32B FP16 with Extended Context Create a Modelfile named Modelfile_qwen3_32b_fp16_tc: FROM qwen3:32b-fp16
PARAMETER num_ctx 110000
PARAMETER temperature 0.3
PARAMETER top_p 0.8
PARAMETER min_p 0.0
PARAMETER top_k 20
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1 Build the custom model: ollama create qwen3:32b-fp16-tc -f Modelfile_qwen3_32b_fp16_tc Example: QwQ 32B FP16 with Extended Context Create a Modelfile named Modelfile_qwq_32b_fp16_tc: FROM qwq:32b-fp16
PARAMETER num_ctx 110000
PARAMETER temperature 0.2
PARAMETER top_p 0.7
PARAMETER min_p 0.0
PARAMETER top_k 40
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.2 Build the custom model: ollama create qwq:32b-fp16-tc -f Modelfile_qwq_32b_fp16_tc Note: The QwQ 32B FP16 model requires approximately 71.3 GB VRAM for inference. Ensure your system has sufficient GPU memory before attempting to use this model. These custom models are referenced in the pre-built provider configuration files (ollama-qwen332b-fp16-tc.provider.yml and ollama-qwq32b-fp16-tc.provider.yml) that are included in the Docker image at /opt/pentagi/conf/.

      <description><![CDATA[Build and deploy AI Agents on Cloudflare Cloudflare Agents Agents are persistent, stateful execution environments for agentic workloads, powered by Cloudflare Durable Objects. Each agent has its own state, storage, and lifecycle — with built-in support for real-time communication, scheduling, AI model calls, MCP, workflows, and more. Agents hibernate when idle and wake on demand. You can run millions of them — one per user, per session, per game room — each costs nothing when inactive. npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template cloudflare/agents-starter Or add to an existing project: npm install agents Read the docs — getting started, API reference, guides, and more. Quick Example A counter agent with persistent state, callable methods, and real-time sync to a React frontend: // server.ts
import { Agent, routeAgentRequest, callable } from "agents"; export type CounterState = { count: number }; export class CounterAgent extends Agent { initialState = { count: 0 }; @callable() increment() { this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); return this.state.count; } @callable() decrement() { this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 }); return this.state.count; }
} export default { async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) { return ( (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ?? new Response("Not found", { status: 404 }) ); }
}; // client.tsx
import { useAgent } from "agents/react";
import { useState } from "react";
import type { CounterAgent, CounterState } from "./server"; function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); const agent = useAgent({ agent: "CounterAgent", onStateUpdate: (state) =&gt; setCount(state.count) }); return ( {count} agent.stub.increment()}&gt;+ agent.stub.decrement()}&gt;- );
} State changes sync to all connected clients automatically. Call methods like they're local functions. Features Feature Description Persistent State Syncs to all connected clients, survives restarts Callable Methods Type-safe RPC via the @callable() decorator Scheduling One-time, recurring, and cron-based tasks WebSockets Real-time bidirectional communication with lifecycle hooks AI Chat Message persistence, resumable streaming, server/client tool execution MCP Act as MCP servers or connect as MCP clients Workflows Durable multi-step tasks with human-in-the-loop approval Email Receive and respond via Cloudflare Email Routing Code Mode LLMs generate executable TypeScript instead of individual tool calls SQL Direct SQLite queries via Durable Objects React Hooks useAgent and useAgentChat for frontend integration Vanilla JS Client AgentClient for non-React environments Coming soon: Realtime voice agents, web browsing (headless browser), sandboxed code execution, and multi-channel communication (SMS, messengers).

      <description><![CDATA[A Low-Code MCP Framework for Building Complex and Innovative RAG Pipelines Less Code, Lower Barrier, Faster Deployment 简体中文 | English Latest News [2026.01.23] UltraRAG 3.0 Released: Say no to "black box" development—make every line of reasoning logic clearly visible Blog [2026.01.20] AgentCPM-Report Model Released! DeepResearch is finally localized: 8B on-device writing agent AgentCPM-Report is open-sourced Model Previous News [2025.11.11] UltraRAG 2.1 Released: Enhanced knowledge ingestion &amp; multimodal support, with a more complete unified evaluation system! [2025.09.23] New daily RAG paper digest, updated every day Papers [2025.09.09] Released a Lightweight DeepResearch Pipeline local setup tutorial bilibili · Blog [2025.09.01] Released a step-by-step UltraRAG installation and full RAG walkthrough video bilibili · Blog [2025.08.28] UltraRAG 2.0 Released! UltraRAG 2.0 is fully upgraded: build a high-performance RAG with just a few dozen lines of code, empowering researchers to focus on ideas and innovation! We have preserved the UltraRAG v2 code, which can be viewed at v2. [2025.01.23] UltraRAG Released! Enabling large models to better comprehend and utilize knowledge bases. The UltraRAG 1.0 code is still available at v1. About UltraRAG UltraRAG is the first lightweight RAG development framework based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture design, jointly launched by THUNLP at Tsinghua University, NEUIR at Northeastern University, OpenBMB, and AI9stars. Designed for research exploration and industrial prototyping, UltraRAG standardizes core RAG components (Retriever, Generation, etc.) as independent MCP Servers, combined with the powerful workflow orchestration capabilities of the MCP Client. Developers can achieve precise orchestration of complex control structures such as conditional branches and loops simply through YAML configuration. UltraRAG UI UltraRAG UI transcends the boundaries of traditional chat interfaces, evolving into a visual RAG Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that combines orchestration, debugging, and demonstration. The system features a powerful built-in Pipeline Builder that supports bidirectional real-time synchronization between "Canvas Construction" and "Code Editing," allowing for granular online adjustments of pipeline parameters and prompts. Furthermore, it introduces an Intelligent AI Assistant to empower the entire development lifecycle, from pipeline structural design to parameter tuning and prompt generation. Once constructed, logic flows can be converted into interactive dialogue systems with a single click. The system seamlessly integrates Knowledge Base Management components, enabling users to build custom knowledge bases for document Q&amp;A. This truly realizes a one-stop closed loop, spanning from underlying logic construction and data governance to final application deployment. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcf437b7-8b79-42f2-bf4e-e3b7c2a896b9 Key Highlights Low-Code Orchestration of Complex Workflows Inference Orchestration: Natively supports control structures such as sequential, loop, and conditional branches. Developers only need to write YAML configuration files to implement complex iterative RAG logic in dozens of lines of code. Modular Extension and Reproduction Atomic Servers: Based on the MCP architecture, functions are decoupled into independent Servers. New features only need to be registered as function-level Tools to seamlessly integrate into workflows, achieving extremely high reusability. Unified Evaluation and Benchmark Comparison Research Efficiency: Built-in standardized evaluation workflows, ready-to-use mainstream research benchmarks. Through unified metric management and baseline integration, significantly improves experiment reproducibility and comparison efficiency. Rapid Interactive Prototype Generation One-Click Delivery: Say goodbye to tedious UI development. With just one command, Pipeline logic can be instantly converted into an interactive conversational Web UI, shortening the distance from algorithm to demonstration.

      <description><![CDATA[BlenderMCP - Blender Model Context Protocol Integration BlenderMCP connects Blender to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Blender. This integration enables prompt assisted 3D modeling, scene creation, and manipulation. We have no official website. Any website you see online is unofficial and has no affiliation with this project. Use them at your own risk. Full tutorial Join the Community Give feedback, get inspired, and build on top of the MCP: Discord Supporters CodeRabbit All supporters: Support this project Current version(1.5.5) Added Hunyuan3D support View screenshots for Blender viewport to better understand the scene Search and download Sketchfab models Support for Poly Haven assets through their API Support to generate 3D models using Hyper3D Rodin Run Blender MCP on a remote host Telemetry for tools executed (completely anonymous) Installating a new version (existing users) For newcomers, you can go straight to Installation. For existing users, see the points below Download the latest addon.py file and replace the older one, then add it to Blender Delete the MCP server from Claude and add it back again, and you should be good to go! Features Two-way communication: Connect Claude AI to Blender through a socket-based server Object manipulation: Create, modify, and delete 3D objects in Blender Material control: Apply and modify materials and colors Scene inspection: Get detailed information about the current Blender scene Code execution: Run arbitrary Python code in Blender from Claude Components The system consists of two main components: Blender Addon (addon.py): A Blender addon that creates a socket server within Blender to receive and execute commands MCP Server (src/blender_mcp/server.py): A Python server that implements the Model Context Protocol and connects to the Blender addon Installation Prerequisites Blender 3.0 or newer Python 3.10 or newer uv package manager: If you're on Mac, please install uv as brew install uv On Windows powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex" and then add uv to the user path in Windows (you may need to restart Claude Desktop after): $localBin = "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin"
$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$userPath;$localBin", "User") Otherwise installation instructions are on their website: Install uv Do not proceed before installing UV Environment Variables The following environment variables can be used to configure the Blender connection: BLENDER_HOST: Host address for Blender socket server (default: "localhost") BLENDER_PORT: Port number for Blender socket server (default: 9876) Example: export BLENDER_HOST='host.docker.internal'
export BLENDER_PORT=9876 Claude for Desktop Integration Watch the setup instruction video (Assuming you have already installed uv) Go to Claude &gt; Settings &gt; Developer &gt; Edit Config &gt; claude_desktop_config.json to include the following: { "mcpServers": { "blender": { "command": "uvx", "args": [ "blender-mcp" ] } }
} Claude Code Use the Claude Code CLI to add the blender MCP server: claude mcp add blender uvx blender-mcp Cursor integration For Mac users, go to Settings &gt; MCP and paste the following To use as a global server, use "add new global MCP server" button and paste To use as a project specific server, create .cursor/mcp.json in the root of the project and paste { "mcpServers": { "blender": { "command": "uvx", "args": [ "blender-mcp" ] } }
} For Windows users, go to Settings &gt; MCP &gt; Add Server, add a new server with the following settings: { "mcpServers": { "blender": { "command": "cmd", "args": [ "/c", "uvx", "blender-mcp" ] } }
} Cursor setup video Only run one instance of the MCP server (either on Cursor or Claude Desktop), not both Visual Studio Code Integration Prerequisites: Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed before proceeding. Installing the Blender Addon Download the addon.py file from this repo Open Blender Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Add-ons Click "Install..." and select the addon.py file Enable the addon by checking the box next to "Interface: Blender MCP" Usage Starting the Connection In Blender, go to the 3D View sidebar (press N if not visible) Find the "BlenderMCP" tab Turn on the Poly Haven checkbox if you want assets from their API (optional) Click "Connect to Claude" Make sure the MCP server is running in your terminal Using with Claude Once the config file has been set on Claude, and the addon is running on Blender, you will see a hammer icon with tools for the Blender MCP. Capabilities Get scene and object information Create, delete and modify shapes Apply or create materials for objects Execute any Python code in Blender Download the right models, assets and HDRIs through Poly Haven AI generated 3D models through Hyper3D Rodin Example Commands Here are some examples of what you can ask Claude to do: "Create a low poly scene in a dungeon, with a dragon guarding a pot of gold" Demo "Create a beach vibe using HDRIs, textures, and models like rocks and vegetation from Poly Haven" Demo Give a reference image, and create a Blender scene out of it Demo "Generate a 3D model of a garden gnome through Hyper3D" "Get information about the current scene, and make a threejs sketch from it" Demo "Make this car red and metallic" "Create a sphere and place it above the cube" "Make the lighting like a studio" "Point the camera at the scene, and make it isometric" Hyper3D integration Hyper3D's free trial key allows you to generate a limited number of models per day. If the daily limit is reached, you can wait for the next day's reset or obtain your own key from hyper3d.ai and fal.ai. Troubleshooting Connection issues: Make sure the Blender addon server is running, and the MCP server is configured on Claude, DO NOT run the uvx command in the terminal. Sometimes, the first command won't go through but after that it starts working. Timeout errors: Try simplifying your requests or breaking them into smaller steps Poly Haven integration: Claude is sometimes erratic with its behaviour Have you tried turning it off and on again?: If you're still having connection errors, try restarting both Claude and the Blender server Technical Details Communication Protocol The system uses a simple JSON-based protocol over TCP sockets: Commands are sent as JSON objects with a type and optional params Responses are JSON objects with a status and result or message Limitations &amp; Security Considerations The execute_blender_code tool allows running arbitrary Python code in Blender, which can be powerful but potentially dangerous. Use with caution in production environments. ALWAYS save your work before using it. Poly Haven requires downloading models, textures, and HDRI images. If you do not want to use it, please turn it off in the checkbox in Blender. Complex operations might need to be broken down into smaller steps Telemetry Control BlenderMCP collects anonymous usage data to help improve the tool. You can control telemetry in two ways: In Blender: Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Add-ons &gt; Blender MCP and uncheck the telemetry consent checkbox With consent (checked): Collects anonymized prompts, code snippets, and screenshots Without consent (unchecked): Only collects minimal anonymous usage data (tool names, success/failure, duration) Environment Variable: Completely disable all telemetry by running: DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true uvx blender-mcp Or add it to your MCP config: { "mcpServers": { "blender": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["blender-mcp"], "env": { "DISABLE_TELEMETRY": "true" } } }
} All telemetry data is fully anonymized and used solely to improve BlenderMCP. Contributing Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. Disclaimer This is a third-party integration and not made by Blender. Made by Siddharth]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Evals is a framework for evaluating LLMs and LLM systems, and an open-source registry of benchmarks. OpenAI Evals You can now configure and run Evals directly in the OpenAI Dashboard. Get started → Evals provide a framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) or systems built using LLMs. We offer an existing registry of evals to test different dimensions of OpenAI models and the ability to write your own custom evals for use cases you care about. You can also use your data to build private evals which represent the common LLMs patterns in your workflow without exposing any of that data publicly. If you are building with LLMs, creating high quality evals is one of the most impactful things you can do. Without evals, it can be very difficult and time intensive to understand how different model versions might affect your use case. In the words of OpenAI's President Greg Brockman: Setup To run evals, you will need to set up and specify your OpenAI API key. After you obtain an API key, specify it using the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. Please be aware of the costs associated with using the API when running evals. You can also run and create evals using Weights &amp; Biases. Minimum Required Version: Python 3.9 Downloading evals Our evals registry is stored using Git-LFS. Once you have downloaded and installed LFS, you can fetch the evals (from within your local copy of the evals repo) with: cd evals
git lfs fetch --all
git lfs pull This will populate all the pointer files under evals/registry/data. You may just want to fetch data for a select eval. You can achieve this via: git lfs fetch --include=evals/registry/data/${your eval}]]></description>

Build, run, and manage multi-agent systems at scale. Docs • Cookbook • Quickstart • Discord What is Agno? Software is shifting from deterministic request–response to reasoning systems that plan, call tools, remember context, and make decisions. Agno is the language for building that software correctly. It provides: Layer Responsibility SDK Agents, teams, workflows, memory, knowledge, tools, guardrails, approval flows Engine Model calls, tool orchestration, structured outputs, runtime enforcement AgentOS Streaming APIs, isolation, auth, approval enforcement, tracing, control plane Quick Start Build a stateful, tool-using agent and serve it as a production API in ~20 lines. from agno.agent import Agent

The agent retrieves context from the Agno MCP server and responds with grounded answers. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24c28d28-1d17-492c-815d-810e992ea8d2 You can use this exact same architecture for running multi-agent systems in production. Why Agno? Agentic software introduces three fundamental shifts. A new interaction model Traditional software receives a request and returns a response. Agents stream reasoning, tool calls, and results in real time. They can pause mid-execution, wait for approval, and resume later. Agno treats streaming and long-running execution as first-class behavior. A new governance model Traditional systems execute predefined decision logic written in advance. Agents choose actions dynamically. Some actions are low risk. Some require user approval. Some require administrative authority. Agno lets you define who decides what as part of the agent definition, with: Approval workflows Human-in-the-loop Audit logs Enforcement at runtime A new trust model Traditional systems are designed to be predictable. Every execution path is defined in advance. Agents introduce probabilistic reasoning into the execution path. Agno builds trust into the engine itself: Guardrails run as part of execution Evaluations integrate into the agent loop Traces and audit logs are first-class Built for Production Agno runs in your infrastructure, not ours. Stateless, horizontally scalable runtime. 50+ APIs and background execution. Per-user and per-session isolation. Runtime approval enforcement. Native tracing and full auditability. Sessions, memory, knowledge, and traces stored in your database. You own the system. You own the data. You define the rules. What You Can Build Agno powers real agentic systems built from the same primitives above. Pal → A personal agent that learns your preferences. Dash → A self-learning data agent grounded in six layers of context. Scout → A self-learning context agent that manages enterprise context knowledge. Gcode → A post-IDE coding agent that improves over time. Investment Team → A multi-agent investment committee that debates and allocates capital. Single agents. Coordinated teams. Structured workflows. All built on one architecture. Get Started Read the docs Build your first agent Explore the cookbook IDE Integration Add Agno docs as a source in your coding tools: Cursor: Settings → Indexing &amp; Docs → Add https://docs.agno.com/llms-full.txt Also works with VSCode, Windsurf, and similar tools.

      <description><![CDATA[GeoAI: Artificial Intelligence for Geospatial Data GeoAI: Artificial Intelligence for Geospatial Data A powerful Python package for integrating artificial intelligence with geospatial data analysis and visualization Introduction GeoAI is a comprehensive Python package designed to bridge artificial intelligence (AI) and geospatial data analysis, providing researchers and practitioners with intuitive tools for applying machine learning techniques to geographic data. The package offers a unified framework for processing satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and vector data using state-of-the-art deep learning models. GeoAI integrates popular AI frameworks including PyTorch, Transformers, PyTorch Segmentation Models, and specialized geospatial libraries like torchange, enabling users to perform complex geospatial analyses with minimal code. The package provides five core capabilities: Interactive and programmatic search and download of remote sensing imagery and geospatial data. Automated dataset preparation with image chips and label generation. Model training for tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation. Inference pipelines for applying models to new geospatial datasets. Interactive visualization through integration with Leafmap and MapLibre. Seamless QGIS integration via a dedicated GeoAI plugin, enabling users to run AI-powered geospatial workflows directly within the QGIS desktop environment, without writing code. GeoAI addresses the growing demand for accessible AI tools in geospatial research by providing high-level APIs that abstract complex machine learning workflows while maintaining flexibility for advanced users. The package supports multiple data formats (GeoTIFF, JPEG2000, GeoJSON, Shapefile, GeoPackage) and includes automatic device management for GPU acceleration when available. With over 10 modules and extensive notebook examples, GeoAI serves as both a research tool and educational resource for the geospatial AI community. Statement of Need The integration of artificial intelligence with geospatial data analysis has become increasingly critical across numerous scientific disciplines, from environmental monitoring and urban planning to disaster response and climate research. However, applying AI techniques to geospatial data presents unique challenges including data preprocessing complexities, specialized model architectures, and the need for domain-specific knowledge in both machine learning and geographic information systems. Existing solutions often require researchers to navigate fragmented ecosystems of tools, combining general-purpose machine learning libraries with specialized geospatial packages, leading to steep learning curves and reproducibility challenges. While packages like TorchGeo, TerraTorch, and SRAI provide excellent foundational tools for geospatial deep learning, there remains a gap for comprehensive, high-level interfaces that can democratize access to advanced AI techniques for the broader geospatial community. GeoAI addresses this need by providing a unified, user-friendly interface that abstracts the complexity of integrating multiple AI frameworks with geospatial data processing workflows. It lowers barriers for: (1) geospatial researchers who need accessible AI workflows without deep ML expertise; (2) AI practitioners who want streamlined geospatial preprocessing and domain-specific datasets; and (3) educators seeking reproducible examples and teaching-ready workflows. The package's design philosophy emphasizes simplicity without sacrificing functionality, enabling users to perform sophisticated analyses such as building footprint extraction from satellite imagery, land cover classification, and change detection with just a few lines of code. By integrating cutting-edge AI models and providing seamless access to major geospatial data sources, GeoAI significantly lowers the barrier to entry for geospatial AI applications while maintaining the flexibility needed for advanced research applications.

      <description><![CDATA[A powerful Telegram bot that provides remote access to Claude Code, enabling developers to interact with their projects from anywhere with full AI assistance and session persistence. Claude Code Telegram Bot A Telegram bot that gives you remote access to Claude Code. Chat naturally with Claude about your projects from anywhere -- no terminal commands needed. What is this? This bot connects Telegram to Claude Code, providing a conversational AI interface for your codebase: Chat naturally -- ask Claude to analyze, edit, or explain your code in plain language Maintain context across conversations with automatic session persistence per project Code on the go from any device with Telegram Receive proactive notifications from webhooks, scheduled jobs, and CI/CD events Stay secure with built-in authentication, directory sandboxing, and audit logging Quick Start Demo You: Can you help me add error handling to src/api.py? Bot: I'll analyze src/api.py and add error handling... [Claude reads your code, suggests improvements, and can apply changes directly] You: Looks good. Now run the tests to make sure nothing broke. Bot: Running pytest... All 47 tests passed. The error handling changes are working correctly. 1. Prerequisites Python 3.11+ -- Download here Claude Code CLI -- Install from here Telegram Bot Token -- Get one from @BotFather 2. Install Choose your preferred method: Option A: Install from a release tag ( ) # Using uv ( — installs in an isolated environment)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram@v1.3.0 # Or using pip
pip install git+https://github.com/RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram@v1.3.0 # Track the latest stable release
pip install git+https://github.com/RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram@latest Option B: From source (for development) git clone https://github.com/RichardAtCT/claude-code-telegram.git
cd claude-code-telegram
make dev # requires Poetry Note: Always install from a tagged release (not main) for stability. See Releases for available versions. 3. Configure cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings: Minimum required: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11

ALLOWED_USERS=123456789 # Your Telegram user ID 4. Run make run # Production
make run-debug # With debug logging Message your bot on Telegram to get started. Detailed setup: See docs/setup.md for Claude authentication options and troubleshooting. Modes The bot supports two interaction modes: Agentic Mode (Default) The default conversational mode. Just talk to Claude naturally -- no special commands required. Commands: /start, /new, /status, /verbose, /repo If ENABLE_PROJECT_THREADS=true: /sync_threads You: What files are in this project?
Bot: Working... (3s) Read LS Let me describe the project structure
Bot: [Claude describes the project structure] You: Add a retry decorator to the HTTP client
Bot: Working... (8s) Read: http_client.py I'll add a retry decorator with exponential backoff Edit: http_client.py Bash: poetry run pytest tests/ -v
Bot: [Claude shows the changes and test results] You: /verbose 0
Bot: Verbosity set to 0 (quiet) Use /verbose 0|1|2 to control how much background activity is shown: Level Shows 0 (quiet) Final response only (typing indicator stays active) 1 (normal, default) Tool names + reasoning snippets in real-time 2 (detailed) Tool names with inputs + longer reasoning text GitHub Workflow Claude Code already knows how to use gh CLI and git. Authenticate on your server with gh auth login, then work with repos conversationally: You: List my repos related to monitoring
Bot: [Claude runs gh repo list, shows results] You: Clone the uptime one
Bot: [Claude runs gh repo clone, clones into workspace] You: /repo
Bot: uptime-monitor/ other-project/ You: Show me the open issues
Bot: [Claude runs gh issue list] You: Create a fix branch and push it
Bot: [Claude creates branch, commits, pushes] Use /repo to list cloned repos in your workspace, or /repo to switch directories (sessions auto-resume). Classic Mode Set AGENTIC_MODE=false to enable the full 13-command terminal-like interface with directory navigation, inline keyboards, quick actions, git integration, and session export. Commands: /start, /help, /new, /continue, /end, /status, /cd, /ls, /pwd, /projects, /export, /actions, /git If ENABLE_PROJECT_THREADS=true: /sync_threads You: /cd my-web-app
Bot: Directory changed to my-web-app/ You: /ls
Bot: src/ tests/ package.json README.md You: /actions
Bot: [Run Tests] [Install Deps] [Format Code] [Run Linter] Event-Driven Automation Beyond direct chat, the bot can respond to external triggers: Webhooks -- Receive GitHub events (push, PR, issues) and route them through Claude for automated summaries or code review Scheduler -- Run recurring Claude tasks on a cron schedule (e.g., daily code health checks) Notifications -- Deliver agent responses to configured Telegram chats Enable with ENABLE_API_SERVER=true and ENABLE_SCHEDULER=true. See docs/setup.md for configuration. Features Working Features Conversational agentic mode (default) with natural language interaction Classic terminal-like mode with 13 commands and inline keyboards Full Claude Code integration with SDK (primary) and CLI (fallback) Automatic session persistence per user/project directory Multi-layer authentication (whitelist + optional token-based) Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm Directory sandboxing with path traversal prevention File upload handling with archive extraction Image/screenshot upload with analysis Git integration with safe repository operations Quick actions system with context-aware buttons Session export in Markdown, HTML, and JSON formats SQLite persistence with migrations Usage and cost tracking Audit logging and security event tracking Event bus for decoupled message routing Webhook API server (GitHub HMAC-SHA256, generic Bearer token auth) Job scheduler with cron expressions and persistent storage Notification service with per-chat rate limiting Tunable verbose output showing Claude's tool usage and reasoning in real-time Persistent typing indicator so users always know the bot is working 16 configurable tools with allowlist/disallowlist control (see docs/tools.md) Planned Enhancements Plugin system for third-party extensions Configuration Required TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=... # From @BotFather

      <description><![CDATA[Open-source AI hackers to find and fix your app’s vulnerabilities. Strix Open-source AI hackers to find and fix your app’s vulnerabilities. [!TIP] New! Strix integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions and CI/CD pipelines. Automatically scan for vulnerabilities on every pull request and block insecure code before it reaches production! Strix Overview Strix are autonomous AI agents that act just like real hackers - they run your code dynamically, find vulnerabilities, and validate them through actual proof-of-concepts. Built for developers and security teams who need fast, accurate security testing without the overhead of manual pentesting or the false positives of static analysis tools. Key Capabilities: Full hacker toolkit out of the box Teams of agents that collaborate and scale Real validation with PoCs, not false positives Developer‑first CLI with actionable reports Auto‑fix &amp; reporting to accelerate remediation Use Cases Application Security Testing - Detect and validate critical vulnerabilities in your applications Rapid Penetration Testing - Get penetration tests done in hours, not weeks, with compliance reports Bug Bounty Automation - Automate bug bounty research and generate PoCs for faster reporting CI/CD Integration - Run tests in CI/CD to block vulnerabilities before reaching production Quick Start Prerequisites: Docker (running) An LLM API key: Any supported provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) Or Strix Router — single API key for multiple providers with $10 free credit on signup Installation &amp; First Scan # Install Strix
curl -sSL https://strix.ai/install | bash # Configure your AI provider
export STRIX_LLM="openai/gpt-5" # or "strix/gpt-5" via Strix Router (https://models.strix.ai)
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key" # Run your first security assessment
strix --target ./app-directory [!NOTE] First run automatically pulls the sandbox Docker image. Results are saved to strix_runs/ Features Agentic Security Tools Strix agents come equipped with a comprehensive security testing toolkit: Full HTTP Proxy - Full request/response manipulation and analysis Browser Automation - Multi-tab browser for testing of XSS, CSRF, auth flows Terminal Environments - Interactive shells for command execution and testing Python Runtime - Custom exploit development and validation Reconnaissance - Automated OSINT and attack surface mapping Code Analysis - Static and dynamic analysis capabilities Knowledge Management - Structured findings and attack documentation Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection Strix can identify and validate a wide range of security vulnerabilities: Access Control - IDOR, privilege escalation, auth bypass Injection Attacks - SQL, NoSQL, command injection Server-Side - SSRF, XXE, deserialization flaws Client-Side - XSS, prototype pollution, DOM vulnerabilities Business Logic - Race conditions, workflow manipulation Authentication - JWT vulnerabilities, session management Infrastructure - Misconfigurations, exposed services Graph of Agents Advanced multi-agent orchestration for comprehensive security testing: Distributed Workflows - Specialized agents for different attacks and assets Scalable Testing - Parallel execution for fast comprehensive coverage Dynamic Coordination - Agents collaborate and share discoveries Usage Examples Basic Usage # Scan a local codebase

gpg --verify SHA2-256SUMS.sig SHA2-256SUMS
gpg --verify SHA2-512SUMS.sig SHA2-512SUMS Licensing While yt-dlp is licensed under the Unlicense, many of the release files contain code from other projects with different licenses. Most notably, the PyInstaller-bundled executables include GPLv3+ licensed code, and as such the combined work is licensed under GPLv3+. The zipimport Unix executable (yt-dlp) contains ISC licensed code from meriyah and MIT licensed code from astring. See THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt for more details. The git repository, the source tarball (yt-dlp.tar.gz), the PyPI source distribution and the PyPI built distribution (wheel) only contain code licensed under the Unlicense. Note: The manpages, shell completion (autocomplete) files etc. are available inside the source tarball UPDATE You can use yt-dlp -U to update if you are using the release binaries If you installed with pip, simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program For other third-party package managers, see the wiki or refer to their documentation There are currently three release channels for binaries: stable, nightly and master. stable is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the nightly and master channels. The nightly channel has releases scheduled to build every day around midnight UTC, for a snapshot of the project's new patches and changes. This is the channel for regular users of yt-dlp. The nightly releases are available from yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds or as development releases of the yt-dlp PyPI package (which can be installed with pip's --pre flag). The master channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. They are available from yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds. When using --update/-U, a release binary will only update to its current channel. --update-to CHANNEL can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. --update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel. You may also use --update-to (/) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories. Example usage: yt-dlp --update-to master switch to the master channel and update to its latest release yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06 upgrade/downgrade to release to stable channel tag 2023.07.06 yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07 upgrade/downgrade to tag 2023.10.07 if it exists on the current channel yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24 upgrade/downgrade to the release from the example/yt-dlp repository, tag 2023.09.24 Important: Any user experiencing an issue with the stable release should install or update to the nightly release before submitting a bug report: # To update to nightly from stable executable/binary:
yt-dlp --update-to nightly # To install nightly with pip:
python -m pip install -U --pre "yt-dlp[default]" When running a yt-dlp version that is older than 90 days, you will see a warning message suggesting to update to the latest version. You can suppress this warning by adding --no-update to your command or configuration file. DEPENDENCIES Python versions 3.10+ (CPython) and 3.11+ (PyPy) are supported. Other versions and implementations may or may not work correctly. On Windows, [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x86.exe) is also necessary to run yt-dlp. You probably already have this, but if the executable throws an error due to missing `MSVCR100.dll` you need to install it manually.
--&gt; While all the other dependencies are optional, ffmpeg, ffprobe, yt-dlp-ejs and a supported JavaScript runtime/engine are highly Strongly ffmpeg and ffprobe - Required for merging separate video and audio files, as well as for various post-processing tasks. License depends on the build There are bugs in ffmpeg that cause various issues when used alongside yt-dlp. Since ffmpeg is such an important dependency, we provide custom builds with patches for some of these issues at yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds. See the readme for details on the specific issues solved by these builds Important: What you need is ffmpeg binary, NOT the Python package of the same name yt-dlp-ejs - Required for full YouTube support. Licensed under Unlicense, bundles MIT and ISC components. A JavaScript runtime/engine like deno ( ), node.js, bun, or QuickJS is also required to run yt-dlp-ejs. See the wiki. Networking certifi* - Provides Mozilla's root certificate bundle. Licensed under MPLv2 brotli* or brotlicffi - Brotli content encoding support. Both licensed under MIT 1 2 websockets* - For downloading over websocket. Licensed under BSD-3-Clause requests* - HTTP library. For HTTPS proxy and persistent connections support. Licensed under Apache-2.0 Impersonation The following provide support for impersonating browser requests. This may be required for some sites that employ TLS fingerprinting. curl_cffi ( ) - Python binding for curl-impersonate. Provides impersonation targets for Chrome, Edge and Safari. Licensed under MIT Can be installed with the curl-cffi extra, e.g. pip install "yt-dlp[default,curl-cffi]" Currently included in most builds except yt-dlp (Unix zipimport binary), yt-dlp_x86 (Windows 32-bit) and yt-dlp_musllinux_aarch64 Metadata mutagen* - For --embed-thumbnail in certain formats. Licensed under GPLv2+ AtomicParsley - For --embed-thumbnail in mp4/m4a files when mutagen/ffmpeg cannot. Licensed under GPLv2+ xattr, pyxattr or setfattr - For writing xattr metadata (--xattrs) on Mac and BSD. Licensed under MIT, LGPL2.1 and GPLv2+ respectively Misc pycryptodomex* - For decrypting AES-128 HLS streams and various other data. Licensed under BSD-2-Clause phantomjs - Used in some extractors where JavaScript needs to be run. No longer used for YouTube. To be deprecated in the near future. Licensed under BSD-3-Clause secretstorage* - For --cookies-from-browser to access the Gnome keyring while decrypting cookies of Chromium-based browsers on Linux. Licensed under BSD-3-Clause Any external downloader that you want to use with --downloader Deprecated rtmpdump - For downloading rtmp streams. ffmpeg can be used instead with --downloader ffmpeg. Licensed under GPLv2+ mplayer or mpv - For downloading rstp/mms streams. ffmpeg can be used instead with --downloader ffmpeg. Licensed under GPLv2+ To use or redistribute the dependencies, you must agree to their respective licensing terms. The standalone release binaries are built with the Python interpreter and the packages marked with * included. If you do not have the necessary dependencies for a task you are attempting, yt-dlp will warn you. All the currently available dependencies are visible at the top of the --verbose output COMPILE Standalone PyInstaller Builds To build the standalone executable, you must have Python and pyinstaller (plus any of yt-dlp's optional dependencies if needed). The executable will be built for the same CPU architecture as the Python used. You can run the following commands: python devscripts/install_deps.py --include-extra pyinstaller
python devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py
python -m bundle.pyinstaller On some systems, you may need to use py or python3 instead of python. python -m bundle.pyinstaller accepts any arguments that can be passed to pyinstaller, such as --onefile/-F or --onedir/-D, which is further documented here. Note: Pyinstaller versions below 4.4 do not support Python installed from the Windows store without using a virtual environment. Important: Running pyinstaller directly instead of using python -m bundle.pyinstaller is not officially supported. This may or may not work correctly. Platform-independent Binary (UNIX) You will need the build tools python (3.10+), zip, make (GNU), pandoc* and pytest*. After installing these, simply run make. You can also run make yt-dlp instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (The build tools marked with * are not needed for this) Related scripts devscripts/install_deps.py - Install dependencies for yt-dlp. devscripts/update-version.py - Update the version number based on the current date. devscripts/set-variant.py - Set the build variant of the executable. devscripts/make_changelog.py - Create a markdown changelog using short commit messages and update CONTRIBUTORS file. devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py - Create lazy extractors. Running this before building the binaries (any variant) will improve their startup performance. Set the environment variable YTDLP_NO_LAZY_EXTRACTORS to something nonempty to forcefully disable lazy extractor loading. Note: See their --help for more info. Forking the project If you fork the project on GitHub, you can run your fork's build workflow to automatically build the selected version(s) as artifacts. Alternatively, you can run the release workflow or enable the nightly workflow to create full (pre-)releases.

--use-extractors NAMES Extractor names to use separated by commas. You can also use regexes, "all", "default" and "end" (end URL matching); e.g. --ies "holodex.*,end,youtube". Prefix the name with a "-" to exclude it, e.g. --ies default,-generic. Use --list-extractors for a list of extractor names. (Alias: --ies)
--default-search PREFIX Use this prefix for unqualified URLs. E.g. "gvsearch2:python" downloads two videos from google videos for the search term "python". Use the value "auto" to let yt-dlp guess ("auto_warning" to emit a warning when guessing). "error" just throws an error. The default value "fixup_error" repairs broken URLs, but emits an error if this is not possible instead of searching
--ignore-config Don't load any more configuration files except those given to --config-locations. For backward compatibility, if this option is found inside the system configuration file, the user configuration is not loaded. (Alias: --no-config)
--no-config-locations Do not load any custom configuration files (default). When given inside a configuration file, ignore all previous --config-locations defined in the current file
--config-locations PATH Location of the main configuration file; either the path to the config or its containing directory ("-" for stdin). Can be used multiple times and inside other configuration files
--plugin-dirs DIR Path to an additional directory to search for plugins. This option can be used multiple times to add multiple directories. Use "default" to search the default plugin directories (default)
--no-plugin-dirs Clear plugin directories to search, including defaults and those provided by previous --plugin-dirs
--js-runtimes RUNTIME[:PATH] Additional JavaScript runtime to enable, with an optional location for the runtime (either the path to the binary or its containing directory). This option can be used multiple times to enable multiple runtimes. Supported runtimes are (in order of priority, from highest to lowest): deno, node, quickjs, bun. Only "deno" is enabled by default. The highest priority runtime that is both enabled and available will be used. In order to use a lower priority runtime when "deno" is available, --no-js- runtimes needs to be passed before enabling other runtimes
--no-js-runtimes Clear JavaScript runtimes to enable, including defaults and those provided by previous --js-runtimes
--remote-components COMPONENT Remote components to allow yt-dlp to fetch when required. This option is currently not needed if you are using an official executable or have the requisite version of the yt-dlp-ejs package installed. You can use this option multiple times to allow multiple components. Supported values: ejs:npm (external JavaScript components from npm), ejs:github (external JavaScript components from yt-dlp-ejs GitHub). By default, no remote components are allowed
--no-remote-components Disallow fetching of all remote components, including any previously allowed by --remote-components or defaults.
--flat-playlist Do not extract a playlist's URL result entries; some entry metadata may be missing and downloading may be bypassed

--color [STREAM:]POLICY Whether to emit color codes in output, optionally prefixed by the STREAM (stdout or stderr) to apply the setting to. Can be one of "always", "auto" (default), "never", or "no_color" (use non color terminal sequences). Use "auto-tty" or "no_color-tty" to decide based on terminal support only. Can be used multiple times
--compat-options OPTS Options that can help keep compatibility with youtube-dl or youtube-dlc configurations by reverting some of the changes made in yt-dlp. See "Differences in default behavior" for details
--alias ALIASES OPTIONS Create aliases for an option string. Unless an alias starts with a dash "-", it is prefixed with "--". Arguments are parsed according to the Python string formatting mini-language. E.g. --alias get-audio,-X "-S aext:{0},abr -x --audio-format {0}" creates options "--get-audio" and "-X" that takes an argument (ARG0) and expands to "-S aext:ARG0,abr -x --audio-format ARG0". All defined aliases are listed in the --help output. Alias options can trigger more aliases; so be careful to avoid defining recursive options. As a safety measure, each alias may be triggered a maximum of 100 times. This option can be used multiple times
-t, --preset-alias PRESET Applies a predefined set of options. e.g. --preset-alias mp3. The following presets are available: mp3, aac, mp4, mkv, sleep. See the "Preset Aliases" section at the end for more info. This option can be used multiple times Network Options: --proxy URL Use the specified HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxy. To enable SOCKS proxy, specify a proper scheme, e.g. socks5://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1080/. Pass in an empty string (--proxy "") for direct connection
--socket-timeout SECONDS Time to wait before giving up, in seconds
--source-address IP Client-side IP address to bind to
--impersonate CLIENT[:OS] Client to impersonate for requests. E.g. chrome, chrome-110, chrome:windows-10. Pass --impersonate="" to impersonate any client. Note that forcing impersonation for all requests may have a detrimental impact on download speed and stability
--list-impersonate-targets List available clients to impersonate.
-4, --force-ipv4 Make all connections via IPv4
-6, --force-ipv6 Make all connections via IPv6
--enable-file-urls Enable file:// URLs. This is disabled by default for security reasons. Geo-restriction: --geo-verification-proxy URL Use this proxy to verify the IP address for some geo-restricted sites. The default proxy specified by --proxy (or none, if the option is not present) is used for the actual downloading
--xff VALUE How to fake X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to try bypassing geographic restriction. One of "default" (only when known to be useful), "never", an IP block in CIDR notation, or a two-letter ISO 3166-2 country code Video Selection: -I, --playlist-items ITEM_SPEC Comma-separated playlist_index of the items to download. You can specify a range using "[START]:[STOP][:STEP]". For backward compatibility, START-STOP is also supported. Use negative indices to count from the right and negative STEP to download in reverse order. E.g. "-I 1:3,7,-5::2" used on a playlist of size 15 will download the items at index 1,2,3,7,11,13,15
--min-filesize SIZE Abort download if filesize is smaller than SIZE, e.g. 50k or 44.6M
--max-filesize SIZE Abort download if filesize is larger than SIZE, e.g. 50k or 44.6M
--date DATE Download only videos uploaded on this date. The date can be "YYYYMMDD" or in the format [now|today|yesterday][-N[day|week|month|year]]. E.g. "--date today-2weeks" downloads only videos uploaded on the same day two weeks ago

--dateafter DATE Download only videos uploaded on or after this date. The date formats accepted are the same as --date
--match-filters FILTER Generic video filter. Any "OUTPUT TEMPLATE" field can be compared with a number or a string using the operators defined in "Filtering Formats". You can also simply specify a field to match if the field is present, use "!field" to check if the field is not present, and "&amp;" to check multiple conditions. Use a "\" to escape "&amp;" or quotes if needed. If used multiple times, the filter matches if at least one of the conditions is met. E.g. --match-filters !is_live --match-filters "like_count&gt;?100 &amp; description~='(?i)\bcats \&amp; dogs\b'" matches only videos that are not live OR those that have a like count more than 100 (or the like field is not available) and also has a description that contains the phrase "cats &amp; dogs" (caseless). Use "--match-filters -" to interactively ask whether to download each video
--no-match-filters Do not use any --match-filters (default)
--break-match-filters FILTER Same as "--match-filters" but stops the download process when a video is rejected
--no-break-match-filters Do not use any --break-match-filters (default)

--use-postprocessor NAME[:ARGS] The (case-sensitive) name of plugin postprocessors to be enabled, and (optionally) arguments to be passed to it, separated by a colon ":". ARGS are a semicolon ";" delimited list of NAME=VALUE. The "when" argument determines when the postprocessor is invoked. It can be one of "pre_process" (after video extraction), "after_filter" (after video passes filter), "video" (after --format; before --print/--output), "before_dl" (before each video download), "post_process" (after each video download; default), "after_move" (after moving the video file to its final location), "after_video" (after downloading and processing all formats of a video), or "playlist" (at end of playlist). This option can be used multiple times to add different postprocessors SponsorBlock Options: Make chapter entries for, or remove various segments ( , introductions, etc.) from downloaded YouTube videos using the SponsorBlock API --sponsorblock-mark CATS SponsorBlock categories to create chapters for, separated by commas. Available categories are , intro, outro, selfpromo, preview, filler, interaction, music_offtopic, hook, poi_highlight, chapter, all and default (=all). You can prefix the category with a "-" to exclude it. See [1] for descriptions of the categories. E.g. --sponsorblock-mark all,-preview [1] https://wiki. .ajay.app/w/Segment_Categories
--sponsorblock-remove CATS SponsorBlock categories to be removed from the video file, separated by commas. If a category is present in both mark and remove, remove takes precedence. The syntax and available categories are the same as for --sponsorblock-mark except that "default" refers to "all,-filler" and poi_highlight, chapter are not available
--sponsorblock-chapter-title TEMPLATE An output template for the title of the SponsorBlock chapters created by --sponsorblock-mark. The only available fields are start_time, end_time, category, categories, name, category_names. Defaults to "[SponsorBlock]: %(category_names)l"
--no-sponsorblock Disable both --sponsorblock-mark and --sponsorblock-remove
--sponsorblock-api URL SponsorBlock API location, defaults to https:// .ajay.app Extractor Options: --extractor-retries RETRIES Number of retries for known extractor errors (default is 3), or "infinite"
--allow-dynamic-mpd Process dynamic DASH manifests (default) (Alias: --no-ignore-dynamic-mpd)
--ignore-dynamic-mpd Do not process dynamic DASH manifests (Alias: --no-allow-dynamic-mpd)
--hls-split-discontinuity Split HLS playlists to different formats at discontinuities such as ad breaks
--no-hls-split-discontinuity Do not split HLS playlists into different formats at discontinuities such as ad breaks (default)
--extractor-args IE_KEY:ARGS Pass ARGS arguments to the IE_KEY extractor. See "EXTRACTOR ARGUMENTS" for details. You can use this option multiple times to give arguments for different extractors Preset Aliases: Predefined aliases for convenience and ease of use. Note that future versions of yt-dlp may add or adjust presets, but the existing preset names will not be changed or removed -t mp3 -f 'ba[acodec^=mp3]/ba/b' -x --audio-format mp3 -t aac -f 'ba[acodec^=aac]/ba[acodec^=mp4a.40.]/ba/b' -x --audio-format aac -t mp4 --merge-output-format mp4 --remux-video mp4 -S vcodec:h264,lang,quality,res,fps,hdr:12,a codec:aac -t mkv --merge-output-format mkv --remux-video mkv -t sleep --sleep-subtitles 5 --sleep-requests 0.75 --sleep-interval 10 --max-sleep-interval 20 CONFIGURATION You can configure yt-dlp by placing any supported command line option in a configuration file.

      <description><![CDATA[Python tool for converting files and office documents to Markdown. MarkItDown [!TIP] MarkItDown now offers an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integration with LLM applications like Claude Desktop. See markitdown-mcp for more information. [!IMPORTANT] Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use pip install 'markitdown[all]' to have backward-compatible behavior. convert_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. No temporary files are created anymore. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to textract, but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. MarkItDown currently supports the conversion from: PDF PowerPoint Word Excel Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) HTML Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) ZIP files (iterates over contents) Youtube URLs EPubs ... and more! Why Markdown? Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively "speak" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Prerequisites MarkItDown requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. With the standard Python installation, you can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands: python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate If using uv, you can create a virtual environment with: uv venv --python=3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# NOTE: Be sure to use 'uv pip install' rather than just 'pip install' to install packages in this virtual environment If you are using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with: conda create -n markitdown python=3.12
conda activate markitdown Installation To install MarkItDown, use pip: pip install 'markitdown[all]'. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git
cd markitdown
pip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]' Usage Command-Line markitdown path-to-file.pdf &gt; document.md Or use -o to specify the output file: markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md You can also pipe content: cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown Optional Dependencies MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the [all] option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: pip install 'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]' will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: [all] Installs all optional dependencies [pptx] Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files [docx] Installs dependencies for Word files [xlsx] Installs dependencies for Excel files [xls] Installs dependencies for older Excel files [pdf] Installs dependencies for PDF files [outlook] Installs dependencies for Outlook messages [az-doc-intel] Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence [audio-transcription] Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files [youtube-transcription] Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription Plugins MarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins: markitdown --list-plugins To enable plugins use: markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag #markitdown-plugin. To develop a plugin, see packages/markitdown-sample-plugin. Azure Document Intelligence To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion: markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e "" More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found here Python API Basic usage in Python: from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins
result = md.convert("test.xlsx")
print(result.text_content) Document Intelligence conversion in Python: from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint="")
result = md.convert("test.pdf")
print(result.text_content) To use Large Language Models for image descriptions (currently only for pptx and image files), provide llm_client and llm_model: from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI()
md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model="gpt-4o", llm_prompt="optional custom prompt")
result = md.convert("example.jpg")
print(result.text_content) Docker docker build -t markitdown:latest .]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Le château de Versailles sous la neige dans une ambiance polaire le 15 février 2010 – Archives Météo-Villes Un mois de janvier exceptionnellement neigeux ! Après un automne 2009 plutôt doux, l'hiver a fait un retour remarqué dès le mois de décembre sur la France. Une première vague de froid s'est en effet propagée jusqu'à la France à partir du 13 décembre avec de l’air glacial venu de Russie envahissant tout le pays et de la neige sur de nombreuses régions, atteignant même la région de Nice le 18 décembre. Cette première vague de froid se termine quasiment le jour de Noël, mais la douceur qui caractérise les derniers jours de l’année ne sera que très éphémère. Après une courte pause plus douce donc, le froid revient de plus belle à partir du 31 décembre 2009. Le début du mois de janvier 2010 est ainsi très hivernal sur la quasi totalité de la France avec de première chutes de neige le 1er janvier entre les côtes de la Manche et l'Île-de-France (10cm en Seine-Maritime). Les 3 et 4 janvier, c'est sur le sud de la France que la neige se montre plus étendue, tombant du Poitou à la région Rhône-Alpes en passant par le Limousin et l'Auvergne, on mesure 20cm à Grenoble, 13cm à Lyon et 8cm à Clermont-Ferrand. 8 cm à Lyon le 4 janvier 2010 – Archives Météo-Villes Le 6 janvier, la neige tombe par averses en Normandie avec 20cm mesurés à Honfleur. Le lendemain, on mesure 30cm à Alençon, 20cm à Dreux, Chartres et entre le sud du 78, 91 et 77 au passage d'une goutte froide alors qu'il neige également sur le sud-est entre le Languedoc-Roussillon et la Camargue puis jusqu'en vallée du Rhône et dans les Alpes la nuit suivante. Alors que la matinée du 8 janvier est glaciale dans le nord du pays avec jusqu'à -20,6°C 0 Brétigny-sur-Orge, battant le record de 1985, de très fortes chutes de neige persistent sur le sud. On mesure jusqu'à 50cm à Gap, 35cm à Grenoble, 30cm à Orange et même 20cm en Camargue. Ces chutes persistent le lendemain avec des cumuls devenant impressionnants dans l'intérieur du Languedoc-Roussillon jusqu'au Tarn. Certains villages d'altitude sont coupés du monde avec parfois plus de 50 à 60cm cumulés ! 60cm de neige le 9 janvier 2010 aux Martys (900m) dans le département de l'Aude – Photographie : meteo81 La neige remonte d'ailleurs de nouveau sur le nord du pays durant cette journée, apportant 2 à 10cm supplémentaires jusqu'en Alsace, Bourgogne, Franche Comté et même en Bretagne. De très nombreuses région françaises sont ainsi sous la neige. Après une nouvelle perturbation accompagnée de neige (3 à 7cm sur une large partie du nord et de l'est du pays) et de pluie verglaçantes entre les Pays de la Loire, la Bretagne et la Basse-Normandie, le temps se montrera plus sec jusqu'au 20 janvier avec un redoux très progressif sur la majorité du pays. Celui-ci restera néanmoins une nouvelle-fois de courte durée. Une troisième vague de froid envahira en effet la France à partir du 25 janvier 2010. Le 28 janvier, de nouvelles averses de neige ont déjà lieu sur un large quart nord-est jusqu'au nord des Alpes avnat une perturbatioj plus active le lendemain, apportant des chutes plus franches en Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine, Bourgogne, Franche-Comté et au sud de l’Alsace. La neige tient surtout au-dessus de 300m d’altitude. Le 31 janvier, la neige atteint de nouveau la Côte d'Azur avec plusieurs centimètres entre Nice et Fréjus, surtout entre Cannes et Saint-Raphaël où les plages sont bien blanchies. Dans le même temps, on mesure -14°C à Aurillac et -11°C à Nevers. Plages blanchies par la neige à Cannes le 31 janvier 2010 au matin – Archives Météo-Villes Un mois de février tout aussi hivernal ! Le mois de février débute donc sous le froid et la neige sur de nombreuses régions. Dès le 1er févier, des chutes de neige sont observées sur une partie du nord et de l'est avec par exemple 5/7cm à Lyon. Le 2 février, on mesure 30cm de neige dès 200m d'altitude dans le nord-est avant un net redoux entre le 3 et le 4 sur la totalité du pays. À La Mure, on passe par exemple de -16,9°C en début de nuit à 10.7°C durant la journée ! Encore une fois, le redoux restera temporaire puisque la 4ème vague de froid de la saison envahira la France le 9 février avec notamment le retour de la neige sur le nord dès la fin de journée. Le 10 février, on observe des averses de neige sur une large partie du nord et du centre du pays, plus fréquentes sur le Pas-de-Calais. C'est néanmoins le 11 février que la neige va se montrer plus généralisée et même parfois forte une nouvelle-fois sur la Côte d'Azur. On mesure en effet 5cm à Nice en fin de journée du 11 février, 10 à 15cm à Cannes et jusqu'à 30-40cm dans la région de Grasse dès 200m d'altitude ! Les jours suivants seront plus secs mais généralement glaciales sur la quasi-totalité du pays, excepté entre la pointe Bretonne, la Côte d'Azur et le littoral de la Corse avec des gelées généralisées et parfois fortes, les minimales descendant souvent sous les -10/-15°C. Les chutes de neige successives et le froid deviennent pesants pour bon nombre de français - Une du 10 février 2010 Cette 4ème vague de froid prendra fin le 17 février avec la reprise d'un flux océanique très perturbé mais aussi plus doux. Plusieurs tempêtes successives concerneront d'ailleurs la France à la fin du mois de février, notamment la fameuse tempête Xynthia le 27 février au soir. L'hiver n'avait néanmoins pas dit son dernier mot, celui-ci faisant un dernier retour durant le mois de mars. Ce début d'année 2010 fut donc exceptionnellement neigeux sur notre pays, le plus neigeux depuis l'hiver 1986-1987, si bien que peu de régions ont été épargnées par les flocons entre décembre, janvier et février.

      <link>https://www.meteo-paris.com/actualites/un-enneigement-exceptionnel-cette-annee-en-montagne</link>
      <description><![CDATA[La neige est très abondante à Val d'Isère en Savoie actuellement ! - Photographie : Station Val d'Isère Même si la neige reste timide en plaine depuis le début du mois de janvier sur la France, le constat est tout autre en montagne. Avec le temps très humide et perturbé de ces dernières semaines, la neige se montre en effet particulièrement abondante sur la majorité de nos massifs, notamment en moyenne montagne où l'épaisseur est parfois impressionnante, même pour une mi-février. Nous vous proposons donc un petit tour de nos massifs. Enneigement MOYEN par massif en bas et en haut des pistes au vendredi 13 février 2026 - relevés Météo-France Voici la liste des stations de sports d'hiver les plus enneigées en haut des pistes (source : Meteo-France) : Piau Engaly : 350 cm La Rosière 1850 : 300 cm Puy Saint-Vincent : 279 cm Saint-François-Longchamp : 265 cm Bonneval sur Arc : 262 cm Flaine : 260 cm Alpe d’Huez : 255 cm Praloup : 255 cm Arêches-Beaufort : 240 cm Chamrousse : 237 cm Les 2 Alpes : 235 cm Alpes C'est sur la partie nord du massif que les quantités de neige sont les plus importantes en station en cette mi-février 2026. On relève en effet en général entre 90 et 110 cm de neige en bas des pistes de la Haute-Savoie au Queyras en passant par l'Isère, parfois plus comme au Grand-Bornand (74) à 1430m d'altitude où on mesure 155 cm de neige ce 13 février. Les quantités sont en général comprises entre 200 et 300 cm en haut des pistes, là aussi des valeurs particulièrement élevées. L'enneigement est exceptionnel à La Rosière (Savoie), ce vendredi 13 février 2026 - cliché Alexandra Brochard via @MeteoExpress Attention toutefois, ces quantités de neige particulièrement importantes entraînent un risque d'avalanche très élevé en cette fin de semaine. Plusieurs avalanches notables ont d'ailleurs été observées ce jeudi 12 février sur le nord des Alpes. Le sud du massif n'est pas non plus en reste avec là aussi des quantités notables. On mesure en général entre 40 et 60 cm de neige en bas des pistes dans les stations des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence et des Alpes-Maritimes et jusqu'à 200 cm sur les sommets. La nivôse de Millefonts (06) mesure par exemple 147 cm de neige à 2430 m d'altitude, soit 86 cm de plus que l'année dernière à la même période ! Pyrénées Le massif pyrénéen est également particulièrement concerné par les chutes de neige ces dernières semaines. Que ce soit l'est ou l'ouest du massif, toutes les stations observent d'importantes quantités de neige en cette mi-février 2026. Certains secteurs des Pyrénées-Orientales ont même relevé des quantités de neige qui n'avaient plus été vues depuis près de 30 ans et d'autres ont atteint des records au début du mois de février ! Si les quantités restent raisonnables en bas des pistes (entre 20 et 40 cm en général) en raison de plusieurs redoux plus ou moins notables depuis le début du mois de février, on relève le plus souvent 200 à 250 cm de neige sur les sommets ! Corse Comme pour les Pyrénées et les Alpes, le temps agité et très humide de ces dernières semaines a apporté une couche de neige particulièrement importante sur les massifs de l'île de beauté. Celle-ci est même plus importante que dans certains massifs alpins avec en général entre 30 et 50 cm à moyenne altitude et jusqu'à 250 cm sur sommets de la région, localement plus ! On relève par exemple 277 cm à la nivôse de Maniccia (2360m), 157 cm de plus que l'année dernière à la même date et presque 2 m de plus qu'en février 2024 ! La station de Bastelica dans le Val d'Ese a même pu rouvrir ses portes au début du mois de février après 3 ans sans neige ! Les autres massifs français sont malheureusement un peu moins bien fournis en terme de neige car moins élevés. L'air globalement assez doux pour la période a en effet limité les chutes de neige abondante sur le Jura, les Vosges et le Massif Central ces dernières semaines en plus de quelques journées de pluie jusqu'aux sommets de ces massifs, entraînant un lessivage parfois notable. On ne relève en général pas plus de 20-25 cm sur les sommets de ces reliefs, ce qui est à contrario déficitaire. Encore et toujours des chutes de neige en vue ! D'autres chutes de neige abondantes sont prévues d'ici la fin du mois (et notamment d'ici le 24 février) à tel point qu'il pourrait encore tomber 1 m à 2,50 m supplémentaires en haut des pistes, notamment sur le nord des Alpes et l'Ouest des Pyrénées ! Les épaisseurs pourraient ainsi atteindre localement 5 m voire davantage...

Notre article vous explique. Une circulation atmosphérique atypique Depuis le début de l'année 2026, le courant jet circule à des latitudes plus basses qu'en temps normal. Il a longuement ondulé de la côte est des États-Unis vers les Açores avant de passer par la péninsule ibérique et la Méditerranée. Ainsi, il a permis aux dépressions de s'enchaîner sur la péninsule ibérique et la Méditerranée avec des pluies affectant une grande partie de la France. En remontant quelque peu, ce jet passe désormais au dessus de la France et maintient l'agitation. De plus, ajoutons que les vagues de froid nord-américaines ont dynamisé l'activité dépressionnaire sur l'Atlantique. En arrivant au dessus de l'océan, l'air polaire favorise le creusement des dépressions, qui traversent ensuite l'Atlantique vers l'Europe. Schéma montrant la circulation basse en latitude du courant jet fin janvier et début février 2026 - Météo Villes Ainsi, cela fait maintenant plusieurs semaines que l'activité dépressionnaire est particulièrement marquée sur notre pays et globalement sur tout l'ouest de l'Europe. Sur la période du 1er janvier au 15 février 2026, l'anomalie de pression atteint -19 hPa par rapport à la normale au large de la Bretagne ! Un tel déficit sur une période de 45 jours est spectaculaire et témoigne de l'activité dépressionnaire hors norme qu'a subi la France. Si vous consultez régulièrement votre baromètre, vous avez surement remarqué que la pression est souvent très basse depuis le début de l'année 2026. Anomalie de pression du 1er janvier au 15 février 2026 - keraunos.org Des cumuls de pluie vraiment remarquables Sur les 45 premiers jours de l'année, 39 ont enregistré au moins 1 mm de pluie en moyenne nationale ! Cela signifie que 87% des jours ont été pluvieux en France depuis le début 2026, un chiffre remarquable ! Non seulement la pluie a été anormalement fréquente mais elle est aussi anormalement abondante. La Bretagne symbolise cet excès de pluie avec des cumuls tout bonnement remarquables. Au 18 février, il est déjà tombé 566 mm de pluie à Quimper depuis le début de l'année ! Cela représente 260% du cumul normal, c'est à dire qu'il est tombé 2,6 fois plus de pluie que lors d'un début d'année moyen ! Jamais de telles pluies n'avaient été observées depuis le début des mesures. Sur le graphique ci-dessous, on note l'absence d'accalmie avec des courbes qui croissent presque continuellement. Cumuls de pluie sur plusieurs villes bretonnes depuis le début de l'année 2026 - Le Parisien Autre indicateur qui permet de montrer que ce début d'année 2026 est véritablement exceptionnel : l'indice d'humidité des sols atteint des records. En effet, en date du 17 février 2026, l'indice moyenné à échelle nationale est à son plus haut niveau depuis le début des mesures pour cette époque de l'année. D'ailleurs, il arrive même sur le podium des situations où les sols ont été les plus humides en France, toutes dates confondues. Seuls décembre 1982 et janvier 1994, théâtres de graves inondations, avaient connu une humidité moyenne légèrement supérieure à la situation actuelle. Indice d'humidité des sols en moyenne nationale du 18 février 2025 au 17 février 2026 - Météo France En résumé : la situation actuelle est véritablement remarquable avec des crues spectaculaires générées par des pluies parfois records, elles-mêmes liées à une séquence remarquablement dépressionnaire, tant par son intensité que sa durée.

      <description><![CDATA[Le dernier mois réellement hivernal en France remonte à février 2018, marqué par deux épisodes importants de chutes de neige et par des températures particulièrement basses, atteignant des niveaux qui n’ont pas (encore) été observés cette année. Sur les 95 vagues de froid observées en France depuis 1900, seule une vague de froid a été observée après 2015 et aucune depuis 2020… La dernière, date donc de février 2018... Source : Serge Saka Une première vague de froid au début du mois Entre le 4 et le 9 février 2018, la France replonge en plein hiver. Un puissant épisode de froid et de neige concerne près des deux tiers du pays, paralysant temporairement plusieurs régions. Tout commence le 5 février, lorsqu’une perturbation venue de Méditerranée remonte vers le nord. La neige tombe jusqu’en plaine sur le Massif central, gagne la vallée du Rhône, la Bourgogne, puis atteint l’Île-de-France en fin de journée. Le 6 février, la situation se complique nettement. Un épisode neigeux majeur frappe l’Île-de-France et les Pays de la Loire. Les chutes deviennent soutenues et tiennent au sol, y compris dans la capitale. Les conséquences sont spectaculaires : un record de 739 kilomètres d’embouteillages est enregistré autour de Paris, piégeant de nombreux automobilistes. Au matin du 7 février, le paysage est est blanc sur les 2/3 du territoire avec une épaisseurs de neige remarquables dans le Bassin parisien. On mesure jusqu’à 25 cm de neige localement, notamment à Vendôme, Dreux ou Versailles, et 12 cm à Paris-Montsouris. Le 8 février, le ciel se dégage mais le froid s’intensifie. Sur des sols enneigés, les températures plongent entre –13°C et –14°C localement, et descendent autour de –6°C à –7°C dans les aéroports parisiens. Enfin, le 9 février, une nouvelle perturbation océanique traverse l’air froid et apporte de nouvelles chutes de neige du Massif central vers l’Île-de-France et le nord du pays, prolongeant cet épisode hivernal marquant. La neige des 6 et 7 février 2018 à Paris où il tombe 12 cm - meteo-paris.com et Alexandre Slowik Une seconde vague de froid, intense, à la fin du mois Du lundi 26 février au jeudi 1er mars 2018, un puissant flux d’air glacial venu de l’est, surnommé le “Moscou-Paris”, envahit une grande partie de l’Europe continentale. Il provoque en France une vague de froid courte mais intense, d’abord sèche, puis accompagnée de neige. Un premier épisode neigeux concerne l’extrême Sud-Est entre le 26 et le 27 février, lié à une instabilité débordant d’Italie. La neige tombe jusqu’en plaine et même sur le littoral entre le Var, les Alpes-Maritimes et l’est des Bouches-du-Rhône. Elle atteint Nice, Menton et surtout Ajaccio, qui se réveille le 27 février sous 15 cm de neige. La nuit des 27-28 février est glaciale sur l’ensemble du pays, avec des températures descendant sous –10°C sur près de la moitié de la France, y compris en Île-de-France, dans le Nord et le Centre. On relève notamment –14,3°C à Luxeuil-les-Bains, –13,4°C à Clermont-Ferrand et Nancy, –11°C à Creil, –10,3°C à Orléans et –10°C à Lyon-Bron. La vague de froid se termine entre le mercredi 28 février au matin et le jeudi 1er mars dans l’après-midi par un épisode neigeux plus généralisé, progressant du Sud-Ouest vers le Nord et le Nord-Ouest. Le Mardi 27 février 2018 au matin, Ajaccio, s'est réveillée sous 15 cm, la plus importante épaisseur de neige dans la ville depuis les 25 cm du 10 février 1986 - source twitter et meteo-paris.com A lire également : &gt;&gt;&gt; La neige à Paris et en Ile de France : toute une histoire &gt;&gt;&gt; Vraie vague de froid venue de Sibérie à partir de lundi &gt;&gt;&gt; Retour de la neige annonçant la fin de la vague de froid &gt;&gt;&gt; Chronique météo du début de l'année 2018 &gt;&gt;&gt; La neige clôt la vague de froid et précède le redoux Auteur : Guillaume Séchet]]></description>

      <link>https://www.meteo-paris.com/actualites/pourquoi-l-hiver-n-est-pas-forcement-termine</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Alors que la douceur va s'affirmer dans les prochains jours, on se demande si l'hiver est terminé en France. Toutefois, le passé lointain comme récent nous ont montré que l'hiver peut encore se manifester bien au delà du mois de février. Congères de 2 mètres à Gonneville dans le Cotentin (50) le 13 mars 2013 - via infoclimat.fr D'importantes coulées froides peuvent encore survenir Lorsque les jours rallongent et que le pôle Nord se réchauffe, le vortex polaire - qui concentre la majorité de l'air froid aux hautes latitudes - devient moins stable. C'est à dire qu'il devient de moins en moins compact. Il peut alors se déformer et entraîne avec lui des ondulations plus importantes du courant jet. Ainsi, des coulées d'air froid peuvent d'échapper du pôle en direction des latitudes moyennes comme la France. Il est donc tout à fait classique d'observer des coups de froid tardifs sur nos régions en mars, ce pourquoi il ne faut jamais enterrer l'hiver trop vite. Schéma d'un vortex polaire instable et d'un courant jet ondulant (classique au printemps) - NOAA Il suffit de regarder les relevés du passé pour se rendre compte qu'un froid marqué peut encore survenir au cours du mois de mars. À Paris-Montsouris, on peut encore descendre sous les -5°C durant la première partie du mois. L'exemple le plus récent date du 13 mars 2013 avec une température qui affichait -5,5°C à l'aube. De plus, on peut encore assister à des journées sans dégel jusqu'à début mars. D'ailleurs, le jour sans dégel le plus tardif est assez récent puisqu'il s'agissait également du 13 mars 2023 où le thermomètre n'avait pas dépassé -1,4°C dans la capitale ! Températures minimales et maximales les plus basses mesurées à Paris-Montsouris en mars depuis 1886 - infoclimat.fr Offensives hivernales en mars : des exemples récents Il est donc important de rappeler qu'il est beaucoup trop tôt pour enterrer l'hiver. Si l'hiver météorologique s'achève au 28 février, le froid et la neige en plaine peuvent encore se manifester bien après ! Rappelons qu'il peut encore neiger sur toute la France au cours du mois de mars. Il n'y a d'ailleurs pas besoin d'aller fouiller dans les archives lointaines pour retrouver des épisodes hivernaux marquants en mars. En 2010, l'agglomération de Perpignan s'était retrouvée sous 25 à 40 cm de neige le 8 mars et les températures plongeaient localement jusqu'à -10°C dans le nord-est de l'hexagone ! 30 à 40 cm de neige sur l'agglomération de Perpignan (66) le lundi 8 mars 2010 - Météo Villes Encore plus près de nous, on peut évoquer la tempête de neige historique qui s'était produite de la Bretagne à la Belgique le 12 mars 2013. La Normandie avait été la région la plus touchée et Météo France avait même déclenché la vigilance ROUGE neige dans la Manche et le Calvados. Le vent violent avait causé des congères atteignant 1 à 2 mètres de haut ! Par endroits, les véhicules étaient littéralement ensevelis ! Hors-congères, il était tombé 20 à 40 cm de façon généralisé dans ces départements. Le village des Pieux dans le Cotentin (50), dans la tempête de neige du 13 mars 2013 - via infoclimat.fr S'il n'y a pour le moment pas de réel signal vers un retour du froid, ce dernier ne peut aucunement être exclu alors que nous ne sommes qu'en février. Ces exemples passés nous rappellent que des coulées d'air froid peuvent suivre les premiers pics de douceur printanière.

      <link>https://www.meteo-paris.com/actualites/encore-une-tempete-pour-mercredi-et-jeudi</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Une dépression très creuse va apporter des vents forts et de nouvelles pluies abondantes sur la France en milieu de semaine Vents forts et nouvelles pluies intenses sont attendues au passage d'une dépression bien creuse sur la France entre mercredi 18 et jeudi 19 février 2026. Le niveau de certains cours d'eau étant déjà très élevé, cette nouvelle tempête laisse craindre le pire. Un temps restant agité dans les prochains jours L’influence océanique perturbée persiste en cette mi-février. Sous l’effet d’un courant jet survolant la France, de nouvelles perturbations sont attendues dans les prochains jours, avec plusieurs zones dépressionnaires circulant sur l’ouest de l’Europe jusqu’au week-end. La situation nécessitera une vigilance particulière entre mercredi et jeudi. Une dépression secondaire devrait se former rapidement en marge d’une zone dépressionnaire au large de l’Irlande, se dirigeant vers la Bretagne puis vers l’Italie jeudi. Cette dépression assez creuse devrait entraîner un temps très agité sur le pays, marqué par des vents forts et de fortes précipitations. Vents parfois forts, en limite du niveau de tempête Alors qu’un creusement dépressionnaire notable se dirige vers notre pays, les vents vont se renforcer sur une partie ouest et sud de la France entre mercredi et jeudi. Les vents les plus forts devraient suivre une trajectoire similaire à celle de la tempête Nils, mais heureusement, ils ne devraient pas atteindre la même intensité. C'est donc notamment entre la façade Atlantique, le sud-ouest et les abords de la Méditerranée que les rafales les plus fortes sont attendues entre mercredi soir et jeudi avec parfois plus de 90-100 voire 140 km/h sur les secteurs les plus exposés. Ceci restera néanmoins à confirmer d'ici là. Rafales maximales de vent prévues d'ici vendredi matin, selon le modèle météo européen - via Meteociel Des pluies abondantes et une aggravation des inondations Outre les vents parfois forts, il conviendra également de surveiller le risque de nouvelles fortes précipitations au passage de cette dépression sur notre pays. En effet, entre les pluies parfois abondantes de ce lundi, surtout sur le sud et l'est de la France et le passage de la dépression PEDRO, les cumuls de précipitations s'annoncent de nouveau très importants entre mardi midi et jeudi soir, y compris dans le bassin de la Seine et de la Loire. Cumuls de précipitations attendus entre mardi matin et jeudi soir – Modèle européen via Meteociel Or, ces précipitations toucheront des secteurs déjà particulièrement durement touchées ces dernières semaines, secteurs où les inondations sont déjà nombreuses et parfois importantes depuis la semaine dernière. C'est notamment le cas d'une large partie ouest de la France où la quasi-totalité des cours d'eau sont en crue et où la Garonne, la Loire Saumuroise et les basses vallées angevines subissent une crue historique. Carte Vigicrues du 18 février 2026 à 09h56 Les précipitations de ce début de semaine, suivies du passage de la dépression entre mercredi et jeudi, risquent d’aggraver considérablement la situation actuelle dans ce secteur, laissant craindre des crues généralisées et potentiellement importantes. Un coefficient de marée et une forte houle aggravant la situation Et comme si cela ne suffisait pas, ces intempéries surviennent au plus mauvais moment. Bien qu’il ne s’agisse pas de marées d’équinoxe, les coefficients restent particulièrement élevés (96 et 97), et la houle générée par cette dépression profonde pourrait dépasser les 6 mètres de hauteur sur la façade Atlantique jeudi matin. Cette situation risque de freiner l’écoulement des cours d’eau et, par conséquent, d’aggraver encore davantage les inondations.

      <description><![CDATA[Certaines plages de la façade Atlantique sont bondées comme en plein été à la fin du mois de février 1990 - Archives Météo-Villes Un changement radical de temps Après trois semaines particulièrement agitées avec une succession de perturbations apportant notamment d'importantes quantités de neige en montagne, des pluies abondantes sur de nombreuses régions et même une puissante tempête sur le nord-ouest de la France, la situation change radicalement sur la France pour la dernière décade de février 1990. Une poussée anticyclonique se met en effet en place sur le pays à partir du 20 février, apportant le retour d'un temps calme et sec mais également un net regain de douceur avec la bascule du flux au sud/sud-ouest en altitude. Situation atmosphérique du 22 février 1990 sur l'Europe – Wetterzentrale Si les semaines précédentes s'était déjà montrées assez douces sous l'influence du flux océanique perturbé, les températures ont pris une toute autre mesure au début de la dernière décade de février 1990. De la chaleur en février ! À partir du 20 février donc, les températures s'envolent sur la totalité du pays. Une véritable vague de chaleur hivernale se met en effet en place sur la France sous ce puissant flux de sud/sud-ouest en altitude. Dès le 20 février, on atteint 20°C jusque dans les Hauts-de-France, 18,5°C à Paris et 19°C à Strasbourg, mais c'est notamment les journées des 23 et 24 février qui se montrent exceptionnellement douces sur la totalité du pays et même chaudes sur certaines régions. Le 23 février, le seuil de chaleur est régulièrement dépassé sur le sud-ouest de la France avec par exemple 25,7°C à Biarritz, 25,9 à Mont-de-Marsan et même 27,2°C à Dax ! Le 24 février, les 26/27°C sont dépassés sur le sud de l'Aquitaine avec jusqu'à 28°C à Peyrehorade (40) et même 28,1°C à Agnos (64). On relève également jusqu'à 25°C à Bordeaux, 23,5°C à Clermont-Ferrand, 22,6°C à Bourges, 22°C à Mulhouse, 21°C à Orléans et 20°C à Paris. Certaines stations du centre de la France atteignent également le seuil de chaleur. De très nombreux records sont observés. Températures maximales relevées sur la France le 24 février 1990 – archive Météo-Villes Cette vague de douceur/chaleur exceptionnelle pour la période prendra fin sur la majorité du pays dès le lendemain avec le retour d'air océanique moins doux. Seules les régions allant du Massif Central au nord-est conserveront des températures très douces avec 22,3°C à Saint-Étienne, 21,8°C à Colmar, 19,9°C à Vichy. Deux tempêtes toucheront ensuite la France entre le 26 et le 28 février. Le mois de février 1990 s'est montré dans l'ensemble exceptionnellement doux. La température moyenne nationale durant ce mois a en effet dépassé la normale 1981/2010 de + 4°C, ce qui n'a jamais été égalé jusqu'à aujourd'hui. Seul le mois de févier 2024 s'est rapproché de cette température moyenne mensuelle exceptionnelle avec une anomalie de + 3,6°C à l'échelle du pays.

      <title><![CDATA[Vers le début d’une lente décrue]]></title>
      <link>https://www.meteo-paris.com/actualites/vers-le-debut-d-une-lente-decrue</link>
      <description><![CDATA[La décrue est en vue sur la France avec le retour de conditions bien plus sèches - Celle-ci s'annonce néanmoins lente dans certains secteurs. Images impressionnantes de la crue de la Charente à Saintes ce mercredi 18 février 2026, dont le niveau va continuer de grimper cette nuit et demain. (photos via EPTB Charente) La décrue s'amorce en cette fin de semaine Le temps se montre exceptionnellement perturbé et humide en France depuis maintenant plusieurs semaines. En conséquences, les crues sont nombreuses et parfois très importantes à travers le pays, notamment sur l'ouest et le sud-ouest de la France. Plusieurs tronçons sont d'ailleurs toujours placés en vigilance rouge par Vigicrues ce vendredi 20 février : - Les basses vallées angevines - La Loire aval - La Loire saumuroise - La Charente aval Sur ces secteurs, les niveaux des cours d'eau continuent d'augmenter en cette fin de semaine avant un pic de crue attendu ce week-end. À Saintes par exemple, la Charente devrait atteindre un pic dimanche 22 février autour de 6.60 m (record de 6.84 m en décembre 1982). Évolution du niveau de la Charente à Saintes du 8 au 22 février 2026 – Vigicrues Ce pic devrait être suivi d'une lente décrue sur ce secteur, comme sur la majorité des cours d'eau de l'ouest de la France. En effet, une poussée anticyclonique est observée dès ce vendredi sur la France, ce qui permettra le retour d'un temps plus calme et sec au moins jusqu'en milieu voire fin de semaine prochaine. Cumuls de précipitations attendus jusqu'au vendredi 27 février 2026 sur la France – Modèle GFS via meteociel Ce retour au sec devrait donc permettre aux niveaux des cours d'eau d'entamer une baisse plus ou moins marquée dès ce week-end et ce durant plusieurs jours, une bonne nouvelle pour les régions sinistrées. Une décrue qui s'annonce lente dans certains secteurs Toutefois, il ne faut pas s'attendre à un retour à la normal dès la semaine prochaine. La décrue s'annonce en effet lente à très lente sur la majorité des cours d'eau français. Il faut en effet attendre que toute l'eau des bassins versants s'évacue avant que les fleuves et rivières retrouvent des niveaux plus normaux, ce qui s'annonce long sachant que les sols sont complètement saturés d'eau sur la quasi-totalité du pays. Il est donc logique d'observer un temps de retard entre l'arrêt des pluies et le début de la décrue, le temps que la pluie tombée en amont des cours d'eau se propage en aval. Schéma d'explication d'un bassin versant – METEO-EXTREME À cela s'ajoute la fonte plus ou moins marquée du manteau neigeux attendue dans les prochains jours sur les reliefs. Cette période plus calme et sèche devrait en effet s'accompagner d'un regain de douceur printanière sur notre pays, que ce soit en basses couches mais également en montagne. Cette douceur devrait engendrer un début de fonte du manteau neigeux parfois exceptionnel présent sur nos reliefs. On relevait en effet souvent plus de 250 à 350 cm de neige en haute montagne du côté des Alpes ce 20 février, parfois 4 mètres du côté de l'Isère. Les Pyrénées sont également très enneigées avec en général 250 à 280 cm sur les sommets de la région. Ainsi, l'eau de fonte devrait donc de nouveau alimenter les cours d'eau et ainsi maintenir des niveaux assez hauts malgré l'arrêt des précipitations. La couche de neige dépasse les 250cm en haute montagne dans les Pyrénées en cette fin de semaine comme ici au col du Portalet - Via Twitter @CyNPirineos Enfin, il est important de noter que certains scénarios envisagent déjà le retour de l'influence océanique perturbée pour la fin de semaine prochaine avec des pluies de nouveau généralisées et des perturbations successives, ce qui pourrait engendrer une nouvelle hausse du niveau des cours d'eau. Cette tendance reste néanmoins incertaine et sera à confirmer dans les prochains jours.

      <title><![CDATA[Et si le mois de mars était très sec ?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.meteo-paris.com/actualites/et-si-le-mois-de-mars-etait-tres-sec</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Encore un peu de patience : cette longue séquence agitée et pluvieuse avec des inondations touche probablement à sa fin. Après une période transitoire d'environ une à deux semaines, il semble que le mois de mars sera beaucoup plus sec. Vers le retour d’un temps plus calme ? Depuis plusieurs semaines, la France est soumise à un flux océanique humide et perturbé. Résultat : des pluies fréquentes, des épisodes venteux parfois soutenus et une instabilité persistante. Les périodes anticycloniques durables se sont faites rares, les hautes pressions peinant à s’installer avant d’être rapidement balayées par le retour des perturbations atlantiques. Une évolution plus favorable semble toutefois se dessiner à moyen et long terme. A partir de ce week-end, les modèles météo envisagent le retour de conditions anticycloniques sur la moitié Sud de la France et le courant-jet remontera vers le nord du continent. Cette configuration apportera un temps plus sec et plus calme pendant au moins quatre jours, et surtout sur les régions de l'Ouest et du Sud-ouest, durement éprouvées par les inondations. Le grand retour de l'anticyclone des Açores sur le sud-ouest de l'Europe ce week-end ! Carte de prévisions ECMWF pour samedi 21 février 2026 Une accalmie durable en perspective ? La prudence reste néanmoins de mise. Si les simulations précédentes suggéraient une installation prolongée des hautes pressions, les dernières tendances sont plus nuancées. Le flux océanique pourrait se remettre en place dès le mercredi 25 février jusqu'en fin de mois. Certains scénarios envisagent cependant un changement plus marqué au début du mois de mars, avec l’établissement d’un vaste anticyclone entre les Açores et le nord de l’Europe. Une telle configuration pourrait bloquer durablement les perturbations atlantiques et favoriser une période sèche prolongée sur la France. Il resterait toutefois à surveiller l’éventuelle formation d’une dépression isolée sur le sud du pays, susceptible de retarder cette stabilisation. Les tendances mensuelles pour mars vont même dans le sens d’un temps globalement plus sec. Si cette évolution se confirmait, elle trancherait nettement avec les conditions agitées récentes et constituerait une bonne nouvelle pour la gestion des crues et des inondations. Néanmoins, à cette échéance, les projections restent susceptibles d’évoluer. Il conviendra donc de suivre attentivement les prochaines mises à jour des modèles météorologiques.

      <description><![CDATA[Neige à Paris - Place de l'Opéra - fin février 1948 - archives meteo-paris.com Une descente froide polaire particulièrement puissante À la fin de janvier et au début de février 1948, une puissante cellule anticyclonique s’installe sur la Scandinavie et l’Europe du Nord. Cette configuration bloque les perturbations atlantiques et favorise un flux persistant d’air continental très froid en provenance d’Europe orientale et de Russie. Les masses d’air, sèches et glaciales, s’étendent vers l’ouest et le sud-ouest du continent. L'air glacial qui descend de la mer baltique vers la France, le 20 février 1948 - Source : Wetterzentrale Une vague de froid intense à la fin du mois de février Du 20 au 27 février 1948 : le froid et la neige envahissent toute la France - la Bretagne est particulièrement concernée par cette offensive hivernale et la température descend à -13° à Brest où la ville est recouverte d’un épais manteau blanc. Les 22 et 23 février 1948 , une tempête de neige d’une rare violence paralyse la moitié nord. La température descend à -20°C à Clermont-Ferrand et -10 à -12°C en Ile-de-France. La neige atteint même la Côte d’Azur. Les maximales restent fréquemment négatives pendant plusieurs jours consécutifs, et le froid est accentué par des vents parfois soutenus, augmentant la sensation de gel. Évolution des températures à Paris au cours du mois de février 1948 - source : site meteo-climat La capitale ainsi que d'autres grandes villes françaises sont paralysées La neige, parfois abondante, persiste au sol en raison des températures durablement négatives. Dans certaines zones, les cours d’eau gèlent partiellement et les sols restent pris par le gel sur une profondeur inhabituelle. Des chasse-neige font leur apparition dans les rues de Paris où la circulation devient praticable impraticable… La paralysie de la Capitale est donc un sujet majeur. L'utilisation de chasse-neige devenue nécessaire dans Paris à la fin du mois de février 1948 - archives meteo-paris.com Pénuries de charbon et infrastructures fragilisées La vague de froid de février 1948 survient dans un contexte d’après-guerre marqué par des infrastructures fragilisées et des pénuries, notamment de charbon et de combustible. Les transports ferroviaires et routiers sont fortement perturbés par la neige et le gel. L’approvisionnement en énergie devient difficile dans plusieurs régions, entraînant des coupures de chauffage. Sur le plan humain, le froid intense provoque une surmortalité, en particulier parmi les populations les plus vulnérables. L’agriculture subit également des dégâts notables, avec des cultures et des arbres fruitiers affectés par le gel prolongé. Une circulation difficile sur la place de la Concorde à la fin du mois de février 1948 - archives meteo-paris.com La vague de froid de février 1948 est souvent associée, dans les archives météorologiques, au « grand hiver 1947-1948 ». Elle demeure une référence pour l’étude des épisodes de froid extrême en Europe de l’Ouest, tant par sa durée que par son intensité et ses impacts socio-économiques.

      <link>https://www.meteo-paris.com/actualites/va-t-il-neiger-mercredi-entre-rouen-paris-et-strasbourg</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Après l’épisode neigeux de dimanche (qui a finalement été moins important que prévu), la douceur est revenue rapidement. Cependant, de nouvelles chutes de neige pourraient se produire en limite de l’air froid mercredi matin. Un conflit avec l'air froid sur le nord de la France Dès mardi soir, de l’air froid en provenance de Scandinavie descendra vers l’Allemagne et la Belgique, et pourrait toucher toutes les régions situées au nord de la Seine. Dans cette zone, les températures seront négatives, tandis qu’au sud de la Loire, il fera facilement plus de 10°C. Les régions autour de la Seine seront donc au cœur d’un conflit avec des températures autour de 0 à 1°C et des précipitations causées par une dépression en Manche. Ces précipitations pourraient se transformer en neige, notamment en raison de l’isothermie engendrée par l’intensité et la persistance de ces dernières. Dans ce type de situation, tout est possible, car la formation de la neige dépend de la température et de l’intensité des précipitations. L'étendue et la localisation des chutes de neige régions dépendront également de la position de la dépression. Position des masses d'air à 850 hPa prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO européen pour mercredi matin - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Une zone de neige possible au niveau de la Seine ou au nord Depuis trois ou quatre jours, le modèle météo européen prévoit des chutes de neige au nord de la Seine, sur une bande d'environ 150 km de large. Ce secteur est souvent le théâtre de confrontations hivernales entre l’air froid scandinave et la douceur océanique, ce qui peut entraîner d’importantes chutes de neige. Les exemples ne manquent pas… Évolution des épaisseurs de neige prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO américain entre mercredi 00h et jeudi 7h - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Selon les cartes de prévision des épaisseurs de neige du modèle météo européen pour mercredi matin, il pourrait tomber entre 1 et 10 cm de neige dans cette zone. Cependant, cette carte pourrait exagérer les chutes de neige, comme ce fut le cas lors de l’épisode de dimanche matin. Ces prévisions dépendent évidemment du conflit, mais surtout des températures. Il est donc possible que seuls les plateaux situés à plus de 100 m d’altitude soient blanchis. Dans ce type de situation, les vallées connaissent généralement des températures trop élevées pour que la neige tienne réellement au sol. Épaisseurs de neige prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO européen pour mercredi matin - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Le modèle américain envisage de la neige un peu plus au nord Le modèle météo européen n’est pas le seul à prévoir de la neige ce mercredi matin. Le modèle américain, quant à lui, anticipe un conflit à peu près calé sur la même zone, mais avec des épaisseurs qui semblent plus réalistes. Soyons honnêtes, certains modèles ne prévoient aucune neige, car les températures seraient trop élevées pour sa formation. Dans ces situations « limites », les prévisions météo sont délicates, même à quelques heures d’échéance.

      <title><![CDATA[Le supplice du terrible hiver 1917]]></title>
      <link>https://www.meteo-paris.com/actualites/le-supplice-du-terrible-mois-de-fevrier-1917</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Vague de froid du mois de février 1917 à Paris : Même les chevaux ne résistent pas ! archives meteo-paris.com Les deux derniers hivers de la Première Guerre mondiale sont particulièrement rudes en France, déjà en partie dévastée par trois années de combats. Entre le 20 janvier et le 15 février 1917, une vague de froid exceptionnelle frappe surtout le Nord et l’Est du pays, atteignant son apogée au début de février avec des températures extrêmement glaciales. Dans « Le Monde Illustré » du 3 février 1917, on note que cet hiver renoue avec la tradition, car selon le journal « les grands hivers d’antan deviennent de plus en plus rares… ». Il est vrai que la courbe de l’évolution des températures hivernales en France indique un réchauffement du début du siècle à l’arrivée de la Première Guerre mondiale. Des conditions météo insoutenables pour le moral des troupes Les sols gelés de l’Aisne, paradoxalement, permettent des mouvements de troupes impossibles sur sols boueux en temps normal. Cependant, l’armée française souffre terriblement du froid, étant nettement sous-équipée pour y résister, contrairement à l’armée allemande. Les régiments ne disposent que de quelques peaux de bête, et certains tirailleurs algériens sont même chaussés de souliers découverts et vêtus de culottes courtes. Ces conditions difficiles affectent grandement le moral des troupes. La relève sous la neige durant la guerre - début 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Jusqu’à -26°C dans les plaines et vallées de l'Est de la France ! Le froid atteint son point culminant au tout début du mois de février avec des températures glaciales : -26 °C à Bonneville, -23 °C à Commercy, -22 °C à Montbrison, -20 °C à Grenoble, -18 °C à Lyon, -17 °C à Alençon et Clermont-Ferrand, et -15,5 °C à Paris. Les dix premiers jours de février sont comparés à la situation de février 1895. A Paris, le déneigement des voies de circulation est très compliqué en raison du manque de main-d’œuvre. Les femmes sont alors réquisitionnées. Février 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Les rivières gèlent peu à peu Les rivières de l’Est commencent à geler le 24 janvier, tandis que celles du Nord, y compris celles de la région parisienne, le sont dans les derniers jours de janvier, un phénomène inédit depuis 1895. La navigation devient impossible sur les canaux puis sur la Seine. Parallèlement, la forte demande en charbon engendre d’importantes difficultés d’approvisionnement à Paris, comme à Londres. Malgré l’utilisation de quelques brise-glace et la construction de barrages pour retenir les glaces près de Rouen, les péniches restent bloquées entre Rouen et Paris. Un service spécial de transports automobiles est alors mis en place. Rouen - 7 février 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Le prix du charbon s'envole !! Les files d’attente pour acheter du charbon s’allongent, et les prix s’envolent. Même les bourgeoises des beaux quartiers doivent attendre des heures, ce qui ne manque pas de provoquer quelques grincements de dents, tant figurés que réels. La pénurie de charbon, alors que de nombreuses machines en dépendaient à l’époque, a de plus en plus d’impact sur l’activité économique. Des lignes de tramway sont interrompues, des usines ferment leurs portes, et les blanchisseries, chauffées au coke, cessent progressivement leurs activités. Certains journaux s’indignent même que les prisonniers allemands soient mieux chauffés que les Français. La rareté du charbon entraîne une flambée des prix du bois de chauffage dans les grandes villes. Il est alors vendu au kilo, après avoir été scié et pesé sur des balances à main. Par ailleurs, les fourrures en peau de lapin deviennent très bon marché.

      <description><![CDATA[Crue majeure de la Loire à Béhuard (49) ce mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Jérémy Girault De nombreux cours d'eau débordent dans l'ouest de la France et certaines crues sont majeures. La situation ne va pas s'arranger car de nouvelles pluies copieuses sont prévues dans les prochaines heures. Notre article fait le point sur la situation. Crues majeures et nouvelles pluies à venir La situation reste particulièrement tendue d'un point de vue hydrométrique dans la moitié ouest de la France où de nombreux cours d'eau étaient encore en vigilance orange ce mardi 17 février 2026. Certains tronçons sont même en vigilance ROUGE : la Garonne marmandaise et girondine, la Loire saumuroise et les basses vallées angevines et, plus dernièrement, la Charente-aval. Ces tronçons de l'ouest de la France subissent actuellement des crues majeures et, pour certains, vont encore monter dans les prochaines heures. Carte de vigilance des cours d'eau émise le mardi 17 février 2026 à 16h - Vigicrues Pour ne rien arranger, la pluie n'en finit plus de tomber. Une nouvelle onde pluvieuse gagne le nord-ouest de la France en nuit du mardi 17 au mercredi 18 février 2026 et plusieurs passages pluvieux balayeront l'hexagone mercredi et jeudi. Sur les 48 prochaines heures, il faut s'attendre à plusieurs dizaines de millimètres supplémentaires sur tout le nord, le centre et l'ouest de la France, ainsi que dans les Alpes. Les cumuls vont atteindre 50 à 70 mm dans l'ouest et le sud de la Bretagne et sur le sud-ouest du Massif Central, sur des sols déjà saturés ! L'ampleur des crues va donc encore croître... Cumuls de pluie modélisés les mercredi 18 et jeudi 19 février 2026 - meteologix.com Plusieurs secteurs lourdement impactés Si la Garonne a atteint son pic dimanche et a depuis entamé une très lente décrue, le pire est encore à venir dans le Maine-et-Loire où plusieurs cours d'eau ont été placés en vigilance ROUGE. Ce niveau maximal d'alerte concerne la Mayenne, Loire, la Maine et la Sarthe dans les basses vallées angevines. Ce mardi 17 février 2026, la crue de la Maine causait des inondations notables sur la promenade de Reculée à Angers et le niveau va continuer de monter probablement jusqu'au milieu de la semaine. Crue importante du Maine à Angers (49) ce mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Jean Ruaud En après-midi de mardi, les services de Vigicrues ont déclenché la vigilance ROUGE en Charente-Maritime. Le pire est à venir car les niveaux sont encore en train de monter plus en amont. À Cognac dans le département voisin de la Charente, le fleuve atteignait 7,75 mètres en fin d'après-midi du mardi 17 février 2026, 16 cm au dessus de la crue de décembre 2023. En Charente-Maritime, les inondations les plus importantes sont prévues en milieu de semaine avec plusieurs dizaines de centimètres supplémentaires prévus à Saintes, où la crue de 2023 est déjà dépassée.

      <title><![CDATA[Vers le retour du beau temps (et la fin des inondations) ??]]></title>
      <link>https://www.meteo-paris.com/actualites/a-quand-le-retour-d-un-temps-plus-stable</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Bientôt le retour d'un temps plus calme ? Depuis plusieurs semaines, la France subit l’influence d’un courant océanique humide et perturbé, engendrant des précipitations fréquentes, des vents parfois tempétueux et un temps durablement instable. Jusqu'à présent, il était devenu rare d’enchaîner plusieurs jours de temps anticyclonique sur la France. Les hautes pressions ne parvenaient jamais à s’installer durablement, et le courant océanique reprenait rapidement le dessus. Cependant, une amélioration semble se profiler. Bien que le temps reste perturbé dans les prochains jours, les prévisions météorologiques annoncent le retour de conditions anticycloniques pour la fin de semaine sur la France et une partie de l’ouest de l’Europe. En effet, le courant-jet devrait circuler plus au nord de l’Europe en fin de semaine, permettant aux hautes pressions (anticyclone des Açores) de s’étendre à nouveau vers l’ouest du continent, et donc vers la France pour le week-end. Cela devrait assurer le retour d’un temps plus sec et calme durant au moins 4 jours. Prévision de l'évolution des anticyclones et dépressions sur l'Europe du jeudi 16 au lundi 23 février 2026 – Modèle européen via Meteociel Un temps calme s'imposant enfin plus durablement ? Il est difficile de prédire avec certitude. Si les modélisations de ces derniers jours suggéraient une tendance anticyclonique plus durable sur notre pays, les dernières simulations remettent en question cette hypothèse. Le courant océanique pourrait reprendre de la vigueur dès mercredi 25 février à la fin du mois. Prévision de l'évolution des anticyclones et dépressions sur l'Europe du lundi 23 février au lundi 2 mars 2026 – Modèle européen Cependant, certains scénarios envisagent une inversion de la situation et l'arrêt de ce courant perturbé océanique au début du mois de mars avec la formation d'un vaste anticyclone entre les Açores et la partie nord de l'Europe. Ceci annoncerait potentiellement le début d'une nouvelle accalmie beaucoup plus prolongée sur la France, mais il faudra attendre que la dépression qui viendra peut-être s'isoler sur le sud du pays disparaisse. Les tendances pour le mois de mars indiquent même un temps durablement sec. Bien que nous restions prudents, une telle évolution serait un contraste saisissant avec les conditions météorologiques récentes et une excellente nouvelle pour la gestion des crues et inondations. Si la majorité des modèles convergent vers cette prévision, il est essentiel de suivre l’évolution des prévisions dans les prochains jours, car les tendances peuvent changer à une échéance aussi lointaine.

      <link>https://www.meteo-paris.com/actualites/premices-du-printemps-pour-le-debut-de-la-semaine</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Les anomalies de température prévue pour mercredi prochain seront très importantes : localement jusqu'à 12°C au-dessus des normales de saison ! Après de longues semaines marquées par une météo très agitée, entre pluies abondantes, vents violents et inondations, la situation commence enfin à s’améliorer. Même si l’hiver n’est pas encore terminé, la fin du mois de février annonce souvent les premiers signes du printemps — et c’est bien ce qui semble se profiler cette année. Retour de l'anticyclone des Açores Depuis plusieurs semaines, l’anticyclone des Açores nous délaisse. Positionné bien trop au sud, il laisse le courant perturbé océanique influencer l’ensemble de l’Europe, y compris la péninsule Ibérique. Dans ce contexte, la France connaît un temps particulièrement instable, ce qui explique des inondations de plus en plus étendues et marquées. La situation s’apprête toutefois à évoluer. Dès ce week-end, les hautes pressions devraient progressivement remonter vers l’Europe continentale. L’anticyclone se centrera alors sur l’Andalousie. Le flux d’ouest océanique restera présent sur la France, mais il sera nettement moins actif : les pluies se cantonneront principalement aux côtes de la Manche. Évolution de la masse d'air prévue entre mardi et mercredi - animation WRF Meteociel Parenthèse printanière d'une à deux journées À partir de lundi, et surtout mardi, les hautes pressions se décaleront davantage vers le continent. Le vent s’orientera au sud, favorisant la remontée d’un air très doux en provenance du Maroc. En cette fin février, le soleil gagne déjà en hauteur dans le ciel. Dans une telle configuration, les températures peuvent grimper plus facilement qu’au cœur de l’hiver. La période de la Saint-Valentin marque d’ailleurs souvent le début du réveil de la nature : certains oiseaux entament leur période de reproduction, ce qui serait à l’origine de cette fête. La fin du mois de février offre régulièrement une ou deux journées aux accents printaniers. Les journée de mardi et surtout mercredi devraient illustrer parfaitement cette tendance : le ciel sera enfin dégagé sur les trois quarts du pays et les températures dépasseront fréquemment les 15 °C l’après-midi. Avec un vent de sud soufflant au pied des Pyrénées, le seuil de chaleur pourrait même être approché, voire atteint localement, avec jusqu’à 25 °C sur le Pays basque. Prévisions des températures METEO-VILLES pour mercredi prochain Cette parenthèse printanière pourrait être d'assez courte durée. Dès jeudi, le courant perturbé océanique devrait reprendre le dessus, entraînant le retour des nuages, de quelques pluies par l’ouest et, mécaniquement, des températures un peu moins agréables, même si la douceur restera d’actualité.

      <description><![CDATA[Après plusieurs journées aux allures de printemps, marquées par une douceur exceptionnelle — jusqu’à 18 °C à Paris le 18 février 1958 — la situation bascule brutalement. Une masse d’air polaire déferle par le nord et le thermomètre s’effondre de 12 °C en seulement quelques heures. Tout le Nord-Pas-de-Calais paralysé après une nuit de cauchemar Dans la nuit du 25 au 26 février 1958, une violente tempête de neige frappe toute la moitié nord de la France, et particulièrement le Nord-Pas-de-Calais. En quelques heures, 10 à 15 cm de neige tombent, balayés par des rafales proches de 120 km/h. D’immenses congères se forment, bloquant routes et autoroutes. Des centaines d’automobilistes se retrouvent piégés dans leur véhicule, incapables d’avancer ou de faire demi-tour. En pleine nuit, des milliers de voitures sont abandonnées en rase campagne. Le bilan est dramatique : quatre personnes perdent la vie. Robert Lamoureux, Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle pris dans la tempête de neige Parmi les conducteurs pris au piège figure le fantaisiste Robert Lamoureux. En route de Bruxelles vers Paris au volant de sa voiture américaine, il se heurte à un véritable mur de neige près de Baisieux. Alors qu’il tente de se dégager, son véhicule s’embrase. Il réussit à s’extraire à temps, échappant de justesse à la catastrophe. Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle vivent eux aussi une nuit éprouvante. Après s’être rendus à Lille pour présenter le film « Ascenseur pour l’échafaud », dont elle est la vedette et lui le réalisateur, ils prennent la direction de Thumeries, au sud de Lille, où réside la famille de Louis Malle. Leur voiture est immobilisée par la neige près de Seclin. Ils ne seront secourus que le lendemain matin, vers 8 heures, par un camionneur, transis de froid. La DS ensevelie par la neige et dans laquelle Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle ont été pris au piège durant une nuit, transis de froid - archives meteo-paris.com Cet épisode marque également un tournant médiatique. À la suite de cette tempête, Paul Douchy, prévisionniste à la Météorologie nationale, commence à présenter la météo quotidiennement à la télévision. Jusqu’alors, depuis le 17 décembre 1946, ce rendez-vous n’était proposé qu’une fois par semaine. Une évolution emblématique d’une télévision française en plein essor, désormais présente dans près d’un million de foyers. Une neige abondante également entre Paris et les régions de l'Est Paris n’est pas épargnée : près de 10 cm de neige recouvrent la capitale, sous des rafales dépassant 115 km/h. Les fortes chutes concernent également l’est du pays — notamment l’Ain, le Doubs et le Jura — où l’épaisseur du manteau neigeux atteint localement 50 à 60 cm. 20 jours plus tôt (le 7 février 1958) l'Alsace connaissant également une tempête de neige particulièrement marquée - archives meteo-paris.com A lire également : &gt;&gt;&gt; Chronique météo de l'année 1958 &gt;&gt;&gt; Notre almanach météo &gt;&gt;&gt; Compte X @Meteovilles Auteur : Guillaume Séchet]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Graves inondations dans le sud-ouest durant le mois de mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Le mois de mars 1930 est resté gravé dans les annales pour sa pluviométrie exceptionnelle dans le sud-ouest de la France, où des inondations d'ampleur historique avaient coûté la vie à plusieurs centaines de personnes ! Des crues d'ampleur dramatique Si les crues observées en ce mois de février 2026 sont majeures, celles survenues il y a un peu moins d'un siècle étaient encore plus spectaculaires. En effet, la fin de l'année 1929 se déroule sous un courant océanique persistant avec de nombreuses précipitations et cette tendance se poursuit au début de l'année 1930. Ainsi, les crues se multiplient sur le pays et atteignent leur apogée au mois de mars 1930, notamment dans les régions du sud-ouest. Les cours d'eau atteignent des niveaux records et les vastes plaines sont recouvertes par l'eau à perte de vue ! Ampleur remarquable des inondations dans le sud-ouest en mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Parmi les crues les plus remarquables, celle du Tarn marque véritablement les esprits. Du 1er au 4 mars 1930, le Tarn et ses affluents atteignent des niveaux et des débits historiques, se transformant en de véritables torrents ! Les communes traversées par ces cours d'eau subissent des crues d'ampleur exceptionnelle et la puissance du courant provoquer l'effondrement de nombreux bâtiments. Le village de Reyniès, sur la photo ci-dessous, est littéralement ravagé par la crue du Tarn ! Le village de Reyniès (82) ravagé par la crue du Tarn en mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Lourds dégâts et plus de 300 victimes ! Lorsque vient la décrue, on découvre des villes et villages ravagés par la puissance de cours d'eau devenus des torrents en furie. Dans le Tarn, la commune de Moissac a subi de lourds dégâts. De nombreux bâtiments qui bordaient le cours d'eau se sont effondrés. En plus des dégâts matériels considérables, le bilan humain est très lourd. Les crues ont emporté des dizaines de personnes, dont certaines ne seront jamais retrouvées. Lourds dégâts à Moissac (82) suite à la crue majeure du Tarn le 4 mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Les crues de mars 1930 dans le sud-ouest font partie des plus meurtrières de l'histoire de France. On dénombre plus de 300 victimes, bien que le chiffre soit approximatif. Les habitations se sont effondrées par centaines, mettant à la rue environ 10.000 personnes ! Le Président de la République de l'époque, Gaston Doumergue, se déplace dans les zones sinistrées pour apporter son soutien aux populations traumatisées par la catastrophe.

      <description><![CDATA[La neige fera son retour en Île-de-France ce dimanche 15 février, tout comme sur d'autres régions du nord et du nord-est de la France - Image d'illustration (vue depuis notre caméra meteo-paris.com) Des chutes de neige relativement éphémères auront lieu ce dimanche jusqu'en plaine entre les Hauts-de-France, tout le Bassin parisien et le nord-est du pays. D'autres épisodes pourraient avoir lieu la semaine prochaine. Retour très bref de la neige en plaine L'invasion polaire continentale qui a eu lieu samedi, fut de courte durée, rapidement remplacée par une poussée océanique plus douce. Si l’air froid persiste sur une grande partie de la France ce dimanche, un nouveau front pluvieux traverse rapidement le pays par l’Ouest. Ce front est accompagné d’un net redoux en altitude, mais la pluie est temporairement précédée de neige pendant quelques heures, là où la couche d’air froid sera suffisamment épaisse. Dimanche matin, la Normandie et l’Île-de-France ont connu des chutes de neige moins importantes que prévues, la perturbation s’étant scindée en deux. La neige a principalement touché un axe s’étendant du Limousin aux Pays de la Loire et au Centre, avant de se réactiver sur les Hauts-de-France, la Champagne-Ardenne et la Lorraine dans l’après-midi et la soirée. Évolution prévue des zones enneigées entre dimanche 8h et lundi 3h – (réactualisation de dimanche 6h - Modèle CEP via meteociel) Quelques centimètres, notamment sur les plateaux Ainsi, les cumul de neige ont été revus à la baisse de la Normandie à l'Île-de-France, mais pas forcément ailleurs. Paris n'a par exemple pas du tout été blanchie. Dimanche en fin de journée, les épaisseurs de neige pourraient dépasser 5 cm entre le nord du département de l'Aisne, ainsi que les Ardennes et le nord de la Lorraine. Épaisseurs de neige maximales prévue pour le dimanche 15 février 2026 (réactualisation de dimanche 6h) – Météo-Villes Une semaine à risque sur les régions du Nord et du nord-est Après le redoux de dimanche après-midi, l’air froid reprendra rapidement le dessus sur la moitié nord dès le début de la semaine. Une dépression, déviée vers le sud par l’air froid persistant au nord, devrait s’échouer sur la France entre mercredi soir et jeudi. Les précipitations, sous cet air froid, pourraient se transformer en neige. Il est cependant encore trop tôt pour déterminer précisément les régions concernées. Des chutes de neige significatives sont possibles, avec un risque accru entre la Normandie, l’Île-de-France et toutes les régions situées au nord de la Seine.

      <description><![CDATA[Quantités de neige remarquables à La Rosière en Savoie (73) le mercredi 18 février 2026 - photo Météo Tarentaise Les stations des Alpes croulent sous plusieurs mètres de neige, perturbant la vie quotidienne. D'importantes avalanches se déclenchent, coupant parfois les routes d'accès aux stations. Sur place, les images sont impressionnantes ! Parfois 3 mètres dans les stations ! Les quantités de neige sont actuellement remarquables dans la plupart des massifs alpins, notamment entre les Hautes-Alpes, l'Isère, la Savoie et la Haute-Savoie. De nombreuses stations mesurent des quantités inédites depuis de nombreuses années, du fait de la succession d'épisodes perturbés depuis plusieurs semaines. La couche au sol atteint fréquemment entre 2 et 3 mètres vers 2000 mètres dans les stations, comme l'illustre le cliché ci-dessous pris à La Rosière en Savoie. La station de La Rosière ensevelie sous plusieurs mètres de neige le mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Météo Tarentaise Dans les stations, la vie est perturbée par ces quantités de neige remarquables. Se déplacer devient difficile voire impossible. Ceux qui n'ont pas bougé depuis plusieurs jours voient leurs véhicules parfois totalement ensevelis sous plusieurs mètres de neige ! Dans les rues, on se déplace dans de véritables tranchées creusées dans la neige et les toitures croulent sous un manteau neigeux particulièrement impressionnant, comme ici dans la station de Bessans. Quantités de neige remarquables à Bessans (73) le mercredi 18 février 2026 - photos Olivier Trompette De plus, les habitations situées au rez-de-chaussée ont une vue considérablement réduite, comme le montrent les photos ci-dessous prises à Chamrousse. Cette station météo, perchée à près de deux mètres, est quasiment atteinte. Les relevés humains ont signalé une couche de 2,70 mètres à Chamrousse à 2000 mètres d'altitude ce mercredi 18 février 2026 ! Il faut remonter à février 2018 pour retrouver des quantités semblables (bien que légèrement moins importantes). Quantités de neige impressionnantes à Chamrousse (38) le mardi 17 février 2026 - via forums d'infoclimat.fr Des difficultés pour atteindre les stations Avec de telles quantités de neige, le manteau neigeux est particulièrement instable et de nombreuses avalanches se sont déclenchées au cours des derniers jours. Certaines sont déclenchées volontairement, comme celle qui a enseveli la route départementale 902 entre Bessans et Bonneval-sur-Arc en Savoie. En début de journée du mardi 17 février 2026, ce sont plusieurs mètres de neige qui sont venus barrer la route, rouverte dès mercredi après-midi après d'importantes opérations de déneigement. Les voitures circulent désormais entre des murs de neige atteignant 5 à 8 mètres !

Dans les stations, on attend souvent 50 centimètres supplémentaires, de quoi rendre la couche totale inédite depuis plusieurs décennies !

      <description><![CDATA[Anomalies thermiques prévues entre le 23 février et le 2 mars 2026 - modèle ECMWF Si les températures ont déjà connu une légère hausse ces derniers jours, ce n’est rien en comparaison de ce qui nous attend cette semaine. Le courant va en effet se diriger vers le sud, permettant à l’air chaud en provenance du Maroc de se propager directement sur la France. La Belgique, l’Allemagne et la Suisse seront également touchées par cette vague de douceur en Europe occidentale. Jusqu'à 12°C au-dessus de la normale ! Tout au long de la semaine, les températures seront largement supérieures aux normales saisonnières pour une fin février, notamment entre mardi et mercredi, lorsque le soleil illuminera les trois quarts du pays. Les écarts à la normale pourraient atteindre sept à dix degrés mardi, et même dix à douze degrés mercredi ! Anomalies de températures maximales prévues mardi et mercredi Plus de 15° presque partout durant quatre jours Entre lundi et jeudi, les températures dépasseront les quinze degrés Celsius l’après-midi sur presque tout le territoire français. La journée la plus douce, voire localement chaude, sera probablement celle de mercredi, car la grande douceur qui aura déjà touché le quart sud-ouest la veille remontera vers les régions du Nord. Températures maximales prévues entre lundi 23 et jeudi 26 février selon METEO-VILLES.COM Peut-être quelques records mensuels battus ? Il sera difficile d’atteindre les records mensuels de douceur pour un mois de février, qui s’élèvent à près de trente degrés dans l’extrême Sud-Ouest et à vingt à vingt-trois degrés sur la plupart des régions. Néanmoins, à Paris, il est possible de se rapprocher des records pour une fin février. Le record pour la troisième décade de février est de 21,4 degrés en 1960. Pour un 24 février, le record est de 20,3 degrés en 1990, et pour un 25 février, il a fait jusqu’à 17,9 degrés à Paris Montsouris en 2019. Records de températures maximales pour un mois de février - Meteociel Pour une fin février, les années de référence sont donc 1960, 1990 et 2019. Pour la moitié sud, on peut également citer 2020 et 2012.

      <title><![CDATA[How We Made SendRec Billing Webhooks Bulletproof]]></title>
      <link>https://dev.to/alexneamtu/how-we-made-sendrec-billing-webhooks-bulletproof-173f</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We shipped SendRec v1.56.0 with idempotent webhook processing for our Creem billing integration. Here's how we made it reliable and what we learned about subscription lifecycle events.
Payment webhooks are unreliable by nature. The provider retries on failure, network issues cause duplicates, and your server might process the same event twice. Without deduplication, a retried subscription.active webhook could overwrite state that a later subscription.canceled event already set.
Creem retries webhooks 5 times with progressive backoff (30s, 1m, 5m, 1h). Each event includes a unique id field (prefixed evt_) and a created_at timestamp. We needed to use these to prevent double-processing.
We created a creem_webhook_events table that serves as both a dedup mechanism and an audit log:
CREATE TABLE creem_webhook_events ( event_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, event_type TEXT NOT NULL, user_id UUID, payload JSONB NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL, processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
); The dedup uses PostgreSQL's INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING and checks RowsAffected():
tag, err := h.db.Exec(ctx, `INSERT INTO creem_webhook_events (event_id, event_type, user_id, payload, created_at) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5) ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO NOTHING`, payload.ID, payload.EventType, userID, body, createdAt,
)
if err != nil { return false, err
}
return tag.RowsAffected() == 0, nil If RowsAffected() returns 0, the event was already recorded — it's a duplicate. This is atomic: no race conditions, no distributed locks, no Redis. Just PostgreSQL doing what it does best.
The initial billing integration only handled two events: subscription.active and subscription.canceled. Real subscription lifecycles are more complex. We now handle:
subscription.active / subscription.paid — activate or renew the Pro plan
subscription.canceled / subscription.scheduled_cancel — log it, but keep Pro access until expiry
subscription.expired — downgrade to free (the actual cutoff)
subscription.past_due — log a warning, Creem is retrying payment
refund.created — immediate downgrade to free]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[I Built a Telegram Bot That Solves the "What Time Is It For You?" Problem]]></title>
      <link>https://dev.to/osovsky/i-built-a-telegram-bot-that-solves-the-what-time-is-it-for-you-problem-3dmj</link>
      <description><![CDATA["Can we do 6 PM your time? Wait, what time zone are you in again?"
I've had this conversation hundreds of times. I work with people across 7 timezones — from Los Angeles to Bishkek. Every meeting started the same way: open World Time Buddy, convert times, paste the result into Telegram, hope nobody gets confused.
But the real problem wasn't the conversion. It was everything that happens after.
Meetings happen in messengers. Not everyone knows each other's email. So nobody adds you to Google Calendar. You get a Zoom link in a Telegram chat, and that's it — no reminder, no calendar event, just a message you'll scroll past and forget.
I needed three things:
Automatic timezone conversion — type the time once, everyone sees it in their city
A Google Calendar link — one click to add the meeting, no email required
DM reminders — because group chat messages get buried
So I built a Telegram bot that does all three from a single message.
Send the bot one line:
Strategy Call, 15.03.2026, 18:00, https://zoom.us/j/123456, @alex @maria It responds with a card like this: Strategy Call Saturday, 15 March 2026 17:00 Riga; Tel-Aviv 17:00 Rome 18:00 Istanbul 20:00 Bishkek 01:00 Beijing (+1 day) 08:00 Los Angeles https://zoom.us/j/123456 Add to Calendar Cancel Reminder Then, 45 minutes before the meeting, every participant gets a personal DM: "Reminder: Strategy Call starts in 45 minutes." And another one 5 minutes before. Service
Role
Cost Vercel
Hosting (serverless)
$0 Upstash QStash
Delayed reminders
$0 Upstash Redis
User allowlist
$0 Telethon
Personal DMs
$0 pyTelegramBotAPI
Bot interface
$0 Total infrastructure cost: $0/month. Everything runs on free tiers.
The entire bot lives in one file — api/index.py. Deploy with git push. No servers, no Docker, no maintenance.
Telegram Bot API has a fundamental limitation: bots can't DM users who haven't started a conversation with the bot. So if I invite @alex to a meeting, the bot can't send Alex a reminder — Alex never messaged the bot.
The workaround: Telethon, a userbot library. It sends DMs from a real Telegram account, not a bot. This bypasses the restriction — but Telegram actively fights spam from userbots. Send too many DMs too fast, and your account gets a FloodWaitError or worse — a permanent ban.
My AI assistant kept warning me: "Don't use Telethon, Telegram will block your account." I used it anyway, with rate limiting and careful batching. So far, no ban.
Telegram limits callback_data (the hidden payload in inline buttons) to 64 bytes. QStash message IDs are long. So when the bot tried to create a "Cancel Reminder" button with the full QStash ID, Telegram threw BUTTON_DATA_INVALID.
The fix: store a short numeric key (cancel:1, cancel:2) in the button, and map it to the full QStash ID server-side. Simple, but it took a debugging session to figure out — we only saw the real error after adding detailed error messages to the bot's responses.
Timezone conversion sounds simple until you hit Daylight Saving Time. Riga and Tel-Aviv are sometimes in the same timezone, sometimes not. The bot uses Python's zoneinfo with IANA timezone database — proper DST-aware conversion, not hardcoded UTC offsets.
When two cities end up at the same time, the bot merges them: 17:00 Riga; Tel-Aviv.
User → Telegram → Vercel (webhook) │ api/index.py (Flask + Bot) │ ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐ │ │ │ Upstash Redis QStash Telegram API (allowlist) (2 reminders) (card + buttons) │ ┌────┴────┐ │ │ -45 min -5 min │ │ /reminder /reminder │ │ Bot msg Bot msg + DMs + DMs (Telethon) (Telethon) Security layers:
Webhook verification via X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token Reminder endpoint protected by custom X-Reminder-Secret header
Dynamic allowlist in Redis (only approved users can create meetings)
Admin roles for managing the allowlist
Input sanitization with html.escape() What I Learned 1. Infrastructure beats features.
The bot has ~10 features (timezones, reminders, DMs, calendar, allowlist, admin roles, cancel buttons). But the real value is the architecture: one file, zero cost, deploy with git push. Features are easy to add when the foundation is solid.
2. Free tiers are surprisingly generous.
After 2 weeks of usage: 37 QStash messages total, 16 Redis commands, 0 bandwidth. The free tier limits (1,000 QStash messages/day, 500K Redis commands/month) are absurd overkill for a personal tool.
3. The Telethon trade-off is real.
Userbot DMs are the killer feature — and the biggest risk. Telegram can ban your account at any time. For a personal tool, the risk is acceptable. For a product with thousands of users, you'd need a different approach.
4. AI debugging is best when it shows, not tells.
The BUTTON_DATA_INVALID bug was invisible — we only saw " Reminder failed." The fix wasn't in the logic; it was adding str(e) to the error message so we could see the real problem in Telegram. AI suggested this in one step.
The bot is live: @inviterLinkBot

Deploy your own in 5 minutes — you'll need a Telegram Bot Token, an Upstash account, and a Vercel account. All free.

      <link>https://dev.to/petruspennanen/how-i-got-9-ai-agents-to-work-together-across-3-different-ides-1kbm</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I run 9 AI agents on a Mac mini - Claude Code, Gemini, GPT, Kimi, and others - each in their own IDE or terminal session. Getting them to actually coordinate was the hard part.
Agent Teams in Claude Code works great when all your agents are Claude. But my setup is mixed: some agents run through OpenClaw, some through Cursor, one through Codex CLI. The built-in team messaging doesn't work across providers, and the tmux-based coordination breaks down once you go headless or run in CI.
I kept hitting the same issues:
Messages silently dropped when agent names didn't match exactly
Plan files getting overwritten when multiple sessions shared a directory
No way to join an existing session into a team without restarting it
Windows and headless environments couldn't use the tmux coordination layer at all
IDE Agent Kit is a lightweight coordination layer that works across different IDE agents. The core idea is simple: agents communicate through a filesystem-based message bus instead of relying on any single IDE's built-in team features.
Each agent gets an inbox directory. A poll script watches for new JSON task files and routes them to the right agent. Agents write results back. No sockets, no tmux dependency, works on any OS.
The setup has three pieces:
Webhook relay - receives tasks from external services and drops them into agent inboxes
Tmux session runner - manages agent lifecycles (optional, you can use whatever process manager you want)
Append-only receipt logs - every action gets logged for audit trails
# Install
npm install -g ide-agent-kit # Start the relay
ide-agent-kit serve # An external service posts a task]]></description>

Rodrigo Duterte, the former president of the Philippines, was “at the very heart” of brutal anti-drugs campaigns that led to the killing of thousands of people, prosecutors at the International criminal court (ICC) have argued, as they called for charges against him to proceed to trial.
Duterte, 80, who was arrested in Manila last year and flown to The Hague, is facing three counts of crimes against humanity over campaigns against drug users and dealers during his presidency, and his earlier tenure as mayor of the city of Davao. Continue reading...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A giant main floor window next to Kohler’s new recirculating shower system isn’t required. | Image: Kohler Kohler claims its new Anthem EvoCycle smart shower system can deliver "up to 80% water savings" without the use of showerheads that limit flow or pressure. The system instead relies on a reservoir in the shower's base that collects used water and passes it through a filtration system before sending it back up through the showerhead. Pricing starts at $7,500, or $5,625 with discounts, but you'll need to buy fixtures and the $825 water tank base separately.
The Anthem EvoCycle's recirculation system starts with a "Standard Mode" where only fresh water is delivered through a handshower sprayer and collected in the reservoir tank. Switching to …

      <title><![CDATA[Building an MCP Server for Linux Desktop GUI Automation on Wayland]]></title>
      <link>https://dev.to/bhyoo/building-an-mcp-server-for-linux-desktop-gui-automation-on-wayland-30b2</link>
      <description><![CDATA[When I started working on AI agent tooling, I hit a wall: there's no clean way to automate GUI interactions on Wayland. X11 had xdotool and DISPLAY=:99 — Wayland killed all of that, by design. No global input injection, no screen grabbing without portal authorization dialogs.
So I built kwin-mcp, an MCP server that gives AI agents full GUI automation capabilities on Linux desktops, running in a completely isolated KWin Wayland session.
Wayland's security model blocks the automation patterns we took for granted on X11. There's no equivalent of pointing tools at a virtual display. XDG RemoteDesktop portals require interactive user authorization — useless for headless automation. And most Wayland compositors don't expose any input injection API at all.
kwin-mcp creates three layers of isolation for each session:
Private D-Bus bus (dbus-run-session) — no interference with host services
Virtual Wayland compositor (kwin_wayland --virtual) — no windows on your display
Scoped input injection via KWin's EIS D-Bus interface — input stays inside the session
The AI agent never touches your host desktop. You get a fully functional KDE Plasma desktop that exists only in memory.
The server provides 29 MCP tools: Category
Tools Mouse
click, drag, scroll, move, button down/up Keyboard
type (ASCII), type unicode, key press, key down/up Touch
tap, swipe, pinch, multi-finger swipe Screen
screenshot, accessibility tree, find UI elements, wait for element Session
start, stop, launch app, list/focus windows System
clipboard get/set, D-Bus calls, Wayland protocol info Screenshot capture runs at ~30-70ms per frame via KWin's ScreenShot2 D-Bus interface. Any action tool accepts a screenshot_after_ms parameter for burst frame capture without extra round-trips.
KWin is (as far as I know) the only Wayland compositor that exposes an EIS (Emulated Input Server) D-Bus interface. This provides the only clean path for input injection without triggering XDG RemoteDesktop authorization dialogs. Since we own the isolated session, we bypass the portal entirely.
KDE Plasma 6+ only (no GNOME, no Sway)
US QWERTY keyboard layout for direct typing (Unicode input via wtype works)
AT-SPI2 accessibility coverage varies by application
# Install
pip install kwin-mcp # Or with uv
uv tool install kwin-mcp Add to your Claude Code MCP config:
{ "mcpServers": { "kwin-mcp": { "command": "kwin-mcp" } }
} The project is MIT licensed and available on GitHub and PyPI.
I'd love to hear if anyone has experience with Wayland automation or has ideas for extending this to other compositors. The EIS protocol is theoretically compositor-agnostic, but KWin is the only one implementing it right now.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/2942089/macbook-pro-m5-pro-max-release-specs-price.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple launched the M5 MacBook Pro in October 2025, but many are still waiting for the company to launch the superior M5 Pro and M5 Max versions of the MacBook Pro. The good news is we may not have to wait for much longer, with the new MacBook Pro possibly launching on, or before, March 4. This article will keep track of rumors about the M5 Pro and M5 Max, when they might launch, what specs and features can be expected, and will offer perspective based on Apple’s Mac lineup. Here’s everything we know so far.
We’ll also address the question: Would power users be wise to wait a little longer for the much bigger changes rumored to be just around the corner? The M6 generation of the MacBook Pro could offer a touch screen and more, according to reports.
At a glance: Current MacBook Pro compared to M5 Pro and M5 Max rumors FeatureM4 Pro / M4 Max (Current)M5 Pro / M5 Max M6 rumours… ReleaseOctober 2024 (current models)Around March 4, 2026Late 2026/2027

These higher-end variants push the boundaries of Apple Silicon by scaling up core counts and memory interfaces and offer a more advanced architecture with greater flexibility for CPU, GPU, and memory configurations. These models also include additional ports, like Thunderbolt 5, that aren’t yet supported at the entry-level.
While the standard M5 MacBook Pro that debuted in October 2025 was little more than a chip refresh to the consumer-targeted version of the machine, the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are expected to deliver significant performance leaps to the MacBook Pro, particularly in graphics and artificial intelligence.
Reports indicate that we can expect a typical performance boost from one chip generation to another – between 15 and 25 percent over the equivalent M4 chips. However, based on the performance gains observed in the base M5 chip – which saw a 13% increase in single-core and a 22% increase in multi-core performance over the M4 – projections for the M5 Pro and Max are optimistic. The M5 Max is expected to be a “AI monster,” potentially cracking the 250,000-point mark in Geekbench 6 GPU compute tests, a feat previously only approached by the M3 Ultra with double the GPU cores. M5 Pro and M5 Max chips: Rumored features and specifications
New chip design for the M5 Pro and M5 Max could feature the CPU and GPU on separate blocks.
The M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are expected to be substantial upgrades over the M4 Pro and M4 Max. Current reports suggest Apple may maintain similar core counts to the M4 generation while focusing on architectural efficiency improvements and higher clock speeds. Although exact specifications have not been confirmed, both chips are expected to scale well beyond the base M5’s 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU configuration. More notably, the M5 Pro and M5 Max are rumored to introduce a major architectural shift aimed at improving AI and parallel processing performance. In October 2025, MaxTech’s Vadim Yuryev reported that Apple is developing a redesigned chip layout that separates the CPU and GPU into distinct blocks. This modular approach could enable more flexible CPU and GPU configurations — for example, pairing a base CPU configuration with a fully enabled GPU. Yuryev suggested that this architectural overhaul is the reason the M5 Pro and M5 Max may be delayed until 2026.
The high-end models are also rumored to use TSMC’s “SoIC-MH” packaging technology, which allows vertical stacking of semiconductor components. This approach is expected to improve thermal efficiency and performance compared to the standard 3nm process used in the base M5. These chips are expected to debut in 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with dual-fan cooling systems, offering better sustained performance under heavy workloads compared to the single-fan base M5 configuration.
At a glance: Process Technology: Built on TSMC’s third-generation 3nm process (N3P), delivering roughly 10% better efficiency and 5% higher performance compared to the M4 series.
Memory Bandwidth &amp; Capacity: Expected to deliver nearly a 30% increase in memory bandwidth (around 153 GB/s on the base M5), with the Pro and Max scaling even further for higher throughput. M5 Pro: At least 48GB RAM
M5 Max: Up to 128GB+ RAM. The Max variant is also expected to remain the only option supporting up to 8TB of storage. GPU Capabilities &amp; AI Performance: Expected improvements include: Third-generation hardware-accelerated ray tracing.
Second-generation dynamic caching.
A rumored “Neural Accelerator” in each GPU core (separate from the standard Neural Engine). Together, these upgrades could enable up to a 4x increase in GPU-based AI workload performance, with the Pro and Max variants further scaling graphics and AI capabilities for demanding professional applications.
Connectivity: Confirmed support for Thunderbolt 5, offering up to 120Gbps for video and 80Gbps for data transfer.
Architecture and Design: Reports suggest higher-end models will separate CPU and GPU blocks, enabling more flexible configurations (e.g., base CPU paired with a max-tier GPU). The architecture is expected to share core design elements with the A19 Pro, improving scalability for professional and AI-heavy workloads. New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Specs
N1 chip: Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6. Thunderbolt 5.
With the launch of the M4 MacBook Pro, Apple made a series of upgrades that replaced outdated components, including upping the base RAM to 16GB, bringing Thunderbolt 5 to the M4 Pro and Max models, and offering a Nano-texture glass option. The M5 MacBook Pro saw no changes to the specs other than the processor. The Bluetooth and Wi-Fi remained the same. A new 4TB SSD option was added, but in the U.K. and Europe, Apple has removed the Power Adapter from the box.
However, more is expected for the MacBook Pro M5 Pro and Max: Apple may integrate the N1 chip, as used in the iPhone 17, which will bring Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, as well as improve features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop. Apple The entry-level model still only offers Thunderbolt 4, but the Max and Pro will continue to offer Thunderbolt 5. There are reports that Apple is working on a 5G modem for the Mac, but it’s unlikely to arrive before 2026. New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Camera
No change expected.
The M4 MacBook Pro added a 12MP FaceTime camera, a decent upgrade from the 1080p FaceTime camera. The M5 Macook Pro maintains this camera, so it is unlikely the Pro and Max models will gain anything. However, we could see a similar FaceTime camera update to 18MP as seen on the iPhone 17. The square sensor is less relevant here as the MacBook Pro will only ever be in one orientation, although it could allow for more of the area around a person to be visible.
More changes are rumored for the camera in the M6 generation: reports suggest that in the future we may see a hole-punch webcam instead of a notch. Petter Ahrnstedt New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Design rumors
No change to the design expected.
Apple last updated the design of the MacBook Pro in 2021. There was no change to the MacBook Pro’s design when Apple introduced the M5 model. Apple will likely stick with the current design for the M5 Pro and Max models. It’s always possible that a new color makes an appearance—like Space Black in 2023—but for the most part, the MacBook Pro design is set for at least another year.
There have been suggestions that an overhaul of the MacBook design could mark the 20th anniversary of the MacBook Pro (the MacBook Pro launched in January 2006 replacing the PowerBook). However, the rumors aren’t pointing to an early 2026 redesign.
Instead, the bigger changes are expected for the M6 generation. In July 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the M5 MacBook Pro series would be the last of the current design. Apple appears to be saving the next major design upgrade for the M6 MacBook Pro for 2026. The M6 upgrade is said to include OLED screens, a camera “hole” to replace the notch, and a thinner design.
New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Display rumors
No changes to the display expected.
Big changes are said to be coming to the M6 MacBook Pro. Foundry There is no change to the display on the M5 MacBook Pro, so it’s unlikely that the M5 Max and M5 Pro models will get any screen updates. Although we could see a higher nits brightness rating, up from the current 1,600 nits peak. As for display support, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips will continue to differentiate themselves from the base M5 through superior expansion and display support. While the standard M5 is limited to two external displays, the M5 Pro is expected to support at least two 6K displays, and the M5 Max will likely support up to four external displays
More changes to the display could be in the pipeline, but not for this generation. Back on February 11, 2025, The Elec reported that OLED displays for the MacBook Pro were going into production, but these weren’t expected to feature in the laptop until 2026. Unfortunately, the big display changes seem set to arrive with a subsequent generation of MacBook Pro, with rumors, again, pointing to Apple introducing OLED screens for the M6 generation of MacBook Pro.
There could be something even more exciting coming with the M6 generation: a touchscreen! Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple is going to launch a MacBook with a touch screen, and it could arrive on a MacBook Pro as soon as 2026. However, this update is not expected to arrive until the M6 generation and could be delayed until 2027. Apple could be saving any drastic changes to the MacBook Pro for 2026. Foundry New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Release date
Launch by March 4, 2026
Apple is expected to release the updated MacBook Pro models featuring M5 Pro and M5 Max chips in the spring of 2026. Apple has confirmed it will hold a series of global “experiences” on March 4, 2026, in New York, London, and Shanghai. Unlike a traditional keynote event, these coordinated sessions are expected to be extended hands-on experiences for the press to interact with new hardware, and the M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro is likely to be one of the new products being demoed at that “experience”. Specific details regarding the launch include:
Experience day: Apple has invited some press to “experiences” on March 4, in London, New York and Shanghai. Production status: Reports from early 2025 indicated that fabrication facilities for these “high-end M5 models” were already being prepared, utilizing TSMC’s advanced SoIC-MH process for improved thermal management.
In December 2025, a MacRumors report indicated that a kernel debug kit used by Apple engineers referenced MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, indicating that the update is coming soon.
On February 1, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple plans to ship the M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro around the time when macOS 26.3 is released. That version is currently in beta and could be released in February or March.
On February 4, Apple released the release candidate for macOS 26.3. This indicates that the software is almost ready to go and could be officially released in the next week or two. The new laptops could follow shortly after or be released at the same time.
On February 9, Gurman reported that the macOS 26.3 beta release candidate cycle runs through March. A release of the new laptops “is currently slated for as early as the week of March 2.”
On February 22, Gurman indicated that Apple will launch “at least five new products” by March 4, and that could include the M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro. Why the Delay?
The staggered release – launching the base M5 in late 2025 while holding back the Pro and Max versions – is reportedly due to a significant architectural shift. As discussed above, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are rumored to feature a new design that separates CPU and GPU blocks, which may allow for greater customization at the time of purchase to meet the parallel processing demands of AI. New M5 MacBook Pro: Price
Prices are unlikely to change.
Reports suggest pricing for M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pros will align with the current Pro and Max models.
Here are the prices for the current standard configurations of the M4 Pro and Max MacBook Pro, for reference. Prices are unlikely to change.
14-inch MacBook Pro
$1,999/£1,999: M4 Pro with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB unified memory, 512GB SSD, Thunderbolt 5

      <description><![CDATA[Au cours des dernières 24 heures, le cours de l’Ether (ETH) a plongé de plus de 5 % pour venir se placer furtivement sous le niveau des 1 850 dollars. Une situation face à laquelle les ventes d’ETH opérées par Vitalik Buterin n’arrangent rien, alors qu’il annonce vouloir « créer une version d’Ethereum moins moche, fondée sur des principes cypherpunk ».]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Progress towards reliable deepfake labelling tech is sluggish, despite all the “help” from AI providers. | Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images As 2025 drew to a close, Instagram head Adam Mosseri ended the year by doom-posting about AI. "Authenticity is becoming infinitely reproducible," Mosseri lamented. "Everything that made creators matter - the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn't be faked - is now accessible to anyone with the right tools." But people, Mosseri insisted, still wanted "content that feels real." His proposed solution was finding a way to label real media. "Camera manufacturers will cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody," he said. The result would be a trustworthy system for determining what's not AI.

      <description><![CDATA[Since announcing earlier this year that it was on the cusp of a major battery breakthrough, Finnish startup Donut Lab has faced a lot of questions, and plenty of skepticism, about its production-ready, solid-state battery. Could the company really make a fast-charging battery at scale while avoiding some of the theoretical production headaches that have stymied past efforts? Today, Donut Lab sought to dispel some of the doubts with the release of the first independent test of its battery, evaluating its charging speed and the "thermal behavior" of its pack.
The test, which was conducted by state-owned VTT Technical Research Centre of Finlan …

      <link>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47124000</link>
      <description><![CDATA[SpecterQA is an open-source CLI for behavioral testing. Instead of writing test scripts with selectors, you define personas (YAML) and journeys (goals). The engine launches a real browser via Playwright, screenshots the page, sends it to Claude's vision model, and the AI decides what to click/type/scroll. Loop until done or stuck.
The idea: test scripts break when markup changes. Vision-based tests break when the UX actually breaks.
Personas have attributes like technical comfort, patience, and role that shape navigation behavior. A "frustrated non-technical admin" navigates differently than a "power user developer." pip install specterqa specterqa init specterqa run -p demo Previously called GhostQA — we rebranded after discovering ghostqa.com exists as an AI testing company. Clean break, no confusion.

      <description><![CDATA[It’s tough not to gush about a 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitor that costs under $400 (I’ve done it before!). AOC’s G-Sync-compatible model with a 240Hz refresh rate and a near-instant response time is down to $379.99 at Best Buy, which matches the lowest price I’ve ever seen for a model with these specs. This seems like a great entry-level OLED for your gaming desktop or laptop setup; it has a similar 111 pixels per inch (PPI) as its competitors, it has a three-year warranty that protects against burn-in from normal use (when you use its panel protection settings), and its 16:9 aspect ratio makes it ideal for PC and console gaming.
AOC 27-inch QD-OLED gaming monitor (Q27G41ZDF) Where to Buy: $549.99 $379.99 at Best Buy The benefits of QD-OLED over IPS and TN panels commonly used in monitors are immediately obvious when you compare them side-by-side. QD-OLED offers deeper blacks (no more black appearing as hues of gray) and better contrast with more color and brightness accuracy. Games and movies will look better than ever. Google Docs? Not so much. Brightness and text clarity are areas where this tech falls behind; viewing a huge, white Google Doc on this and other OLEDs will make it appear somewhat dim. And, while newer OLED monitors boast clearer text thanks to vertical RGB stripes in their panels, you might notice some fringing around letters with this monitor (and many others on the market) if you look closely.

      <description><![CDATA[From Ancient Inspiration to Modern Web Development — A Deep Dive into Creating a High-Performance Browser Tool with React and Manifest V3. In the fast-paced world of web development, we are often overwhelmed by complex SEO dashboards. Most tools are either hidden behind expensive paywalls or cluttered with ads that compromise user privacy. I wanted something different: an analyzer that is fast, beautiful, and runs entirely in the browser. That’s how Tishra Analyzer was born.
The name Tishra (derived from Tishtar) comes from ancient Persian mythology, representing the star of brightness and rain. My goal was to build a tool that lives up to its name — bringing “brightness” to the hidden metadata of the web and “refreshing” the way developers audit their sites.
Building a browser extension in 2026 requires balancing performance with strict browser standards. Here is the stack I chose:
React.js: For a modular and reactive User Interface.
Manifest V3: Ensuring future-proof compatibility with the latest Chrome and Firefox standards.
Local Logic: Unlike many tools, the analysis engine runs 100% locally on your machine.
Tishra Analyzer doesn’t just give you raw data; it interprets it.
The Intelligent Health Score Real-time SERP Preview Security &amp; Performance Layers Tishra Analyzer is open-source and available now.

      <link>https://sowbot.co.uk/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Sowbot is an open-hardware agricultural robot designed to close the "prototype gap" that kills most agri-robotics startups and research projects — the 18+ months spent on drivers, networking, safety watchdogs, and UI before you can even start on the thing you actually care about.
The hardware is built around a stackable 10×10cm compute module with two ARM Cortex-A55 SBCs — one for ROS 2 navigation/EKF localisation, one dedicated to vision/YOLO inference — connected via a single ethernet cable.
Centimetre-level positioning via dual RTK GNSS, CAN bus for field comms, and real-time motor control via ESP32 running Lizard firmware.
Everything — schematics, PCB layouts, firmware — is under open licences.
The software stack runs on RoSys/Field Friend (for teams who want fast iteration) or DevKit ROS (for teams already in the ROS ecosystem). The idea is that a lab in one country can reproduce another lab's experiment by sharing a Docker image.
Current status: the Open Core brain is largely fabricated, the full-size Sowbot body has a detailed BOM but isn't yet assembled, and we have two smaller dev platforms (Mini and Pico) in various stages of testing.
We're a small volunteer team and we're looking for contributors — hardware, ROS, firmware, docs, whatever you can offer.
The best place to start is our Discord: https://discord.gg/SvztEBr4KZ — we have a weekly call if you'd prefer to just show up and chat.

      <link>https://dev.to/agenium_platform/why-we-built-a-trust-page-before-we-tried-to-scale-21mb</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Why We Built a Trust Page Before We Tried to Scale Building in public — Week 2 of shipping Agenium Messenger
We hit a wall this week.
43 outreach contacts. Zero logins.
Not zero responses — we got replies, kind words, "looks interesting." But nobody logged in. And after Council 34 (our AI agent council session), the diagnosis was simple:
They don't trust us yet.
Not because we've done anything wrong. But because: we're unknown. We're asking for a Telegram login. The product is early. The team is two people. And we haven't explained any of that clearly.
So before we sent another outreach email, we shipped a Trust Page.
chat.agenium.net/trust covers:
Real names. GitHub profiles. Telegram handles. Not "a team of passionate engineers."
Every package is on GitHub. npm. PyPI. The code is readable. You don't have to take our word for anything — go look.
Plain English:
Your Telegram ID and username (for login)
Your agent address (e.g., username.telegram) in our DNS
Messages you send to demo agents (for the demo to work)
What we don't store:
We don't sell data
We don't train AI on your conversations We don't share data with third parties
Three steps. No dark patterns. No "email us and wait 30 days."
Self-hosted (not AWS-dependent)
Umami for analytics (open source, privacy-first)
All APIs under 100ms
HTTPS everywhere
If you're building an app that uses your Telegram login, a privacy page is table stakes.
But for agent infrastructure, trust is even more important — because agents act on your behalf. When assistant.agent receives a message from someone else's agent, it's making decisions that affect you. The trust layer isn't a nice-to-have; it's foundational.
This is one of the three pillars of what we're building:
Discovery — agents find each other (the DNS layer)
Connection — agents communicate (the Messenger layer)
Trust — agents verify each other (the reputation + transparency layer)
The Trust Page is the start of pillar 3.
We have: A working Messenger (chat.agenium.net) Agent Cards API (machine-readable agent profiles) .telegram domain auto-registration on login A Discovery page (find agents by capability) Pre-login demo (try before committing to login) A Trust Page Open source code
We don't have: 10 active users yet (our current target) A big team Investors
We're building in public because we believe the infrastructure for the agent economy should be transparent and open — not black-boxed by one company.
We're still looking for our first 10 real users.
If you're building AI agents and you want:
A permanent address (yourname.telegram)
An inbox that your agent actually reads
Agent Cards so other agents can discover you by capability
3 months of premium AI — free
"Founding Member" badge
→ chat.agenium.net/founding
Telegram login. 2 minutes. No credit card.
We're sharing the full journey — engineering decisions, user counts (currently 0), pivot moments, and all. If you want to follow along or give early feedback, find us at hello@agenium.net.

      <description><![CDATA[I want to share my side project — SecureShare. It's a desktop app for direct file transfer between two computers with end-to-end encryption.
This post isn't about how great it is. It's more about the technical decisions, the pitfalls, and why certain things are built the way they are. I'd love to hear your thoughts and criticism. I needed to send a confidential document to someone in another city. My options:
Google Drive / Dropbox — the file sits on someone else's servers, the company has access
Telegram — convenient, but files are stored on their servers, and "secret chats" don't handle files well
Email — no WeTransfer — the file is temporarily stored on their servers
All of these have the same issue: my file ends up on someone else's server, and I don't control what happens to it next.
I wanted something simple: send a file directly, encrypted on my device, decrypted only on the recipient's device. No sign-ups, no accounts.
The architecture is fairly straightforward:
Sender ←—WSS—→ Relay Server ←—WSS—→ Receiver Both clients connect to the relay server via WebSocket (TLS)
X25519 key exchange (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)
Both sides see a verification code — like Signal's safety numbers, to confirm no one is intercepting
The file is encrypted with AES-256-GCM and sent in chunks
SHA-256 hash verification at the end
The relay server is literally a pipe. It receives encrypted bytes from the sender and forwards them to the receiver. The server doesn't know the file name, its contents, or even its size (because metadata is also encrypted).
I thought about this for a while. XChaCha20-Poly1305 is often for new projects — it's simpler and less sensitive to nonce misuse. But I went with AES-256-GCM for a few reasons:
Broad support in Python's cryptography library
Hardware acceleration via AES-NI on most CPUs
Secure enough with proper nonce management
To prevent nonce reuse, I built a prefix system: each side gets its own 4-byte prefix (determined by comparing public keys), plus an 8-byte counter. This guarantees nonces never repeat.
Honestly, if I were starting over — I might choose XChaCha20. Less headache with nonces. But AES-GCM works, and I'm not planning to change it.
One thing that frustrated me about other solutions — no MITM protection. If the relay server is compromised, it could swap keys. So both users see a short code (first 8 chars of SHA-256 of the shared secret) and must compare it. Like Signal's safety number verification.
It's not perfect — users can ignore the verification. But at least the mechanism exists.
The first version tried to work peer-to-peer via MQTT. It was a nightmare: NAT traversal, STUN/TURN, firewalls... Eventually I gave up and built a simple WebSocket relay on a VPS. Yes, this adds a single point of failure, but:
Works through any NAT and firewall
No network configuration needed
The relay is fully self-hostable — spin up your own in 5 minutes via Docker # docker-compose.yml — the entire server
services: relay: build: . restart: unless-stopped caddy: image: caddy:2 ports: ["80:80", "443:443"] volumes: - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile This is a feature I didn't plan but turned out to be critical. Imagine: you're transferring a 3 GB file, and at 80% your Wi-Fi drops for 10 seconds.
Without resume — start over. With resume — the client automatically reconnects, re-does the key exchange, and continues from where it left off. The receiver stores a .resume manifest with information about received chunks.
This was tricky to get right. Especially the part where a reconnect needs a new key exchange (because the connection is new), but verification can be skipped (because a reconnect_token proves identity). Component
Technology Client
Python + CustomTkinter Encryption
cryptography (X25519, AES-256-GCM, HKDF) Relay server
Python asyncio + websockets TLS
Caddy + Let's Encrypt DNS
DuckDNS Build
PyInstaller (.exe / Linux binary) Why Python? Because it's a side project, and I wanted to move fast. CustomTkinter gives a decent-looking GUI with minimal code. Yes, the .exe is ~30 MB (PyInstaller), and it doesn't start instantly. If this were a commercial product — I'd pick something else.
I'll be honest — there are things that annoy me too:
One file per session. Want to send 5 files? Pack them into an archive. It's a protocol limitation, and changing it basically means rewriting the transfer logic
No macOS build. PyInstaller + CustomTkinter + macOS = suffering. It runs from source, but I don't build a .app
5 GB limit. Server-side limit to prevent one user from hogging the channel. Enough for most tasks, but not all
GUI could be better. CustomTkinter is a compromise. Looks okay, but it's not Electron and not a native UI
The interface supports three languages (Ukrainian, English, German) with live switching — no restart needed. Dark theme by default.
Here's a real transfer of a 2.9 GB file between two devices:
The sender generates a session code (ooxv-zhef) and shares it with the receiver. After connecting, both see a verification code (FD79-FDBB) — if it matches, no one has intercepted the connection. Then the file flies through as an encrypted stream at ~15 MB/s.
At the bottom of the window — a log showing every step: file hash, relay connection, key exchange, verification, transfer. Full transparency.
I have a few ideas, but I'm not sure about priorities:
Web version (so you don't need to download .exe)
Folder transfer support
Better verification UX (maybe QR codes?)
macOS build
If you have thoughts on what matters most — I'd love to hear it.

I'd appreciate any feedback — especially on the cryptography and architecture. If you see holes in the security model — please tell me, that's the most valuable input.

      <link>https://github.com/enjector/microgpt-c</link>
      <description><![CDATA[TL;DR: Pure C99 GPT-2 engine, zero dependencies. Sub-1M-parameter “organelles” coordinate via a Planner-Worker-Judge pipeline and beat random opponents up to 91 % on logic games, all on CPU.
I’m a C/C++ architect focused on low-latency systems. Last year, I tried building agentic pipelines with SLMs/LLMs and hit the usual wall: latency and orchestration overhead killed real-time edge use cases.
Initial research video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-rs9VZ1-0I
So I asked: how far can you push specialised logic at https://gist.github.com/karpathy/8627fe009c40f57531cb1836010...). Zero deps, single-header, localised KV cache. Speed was never the goal (Andrej’s nanoGPT and llm.c already showed what’s possible). The real experiment was orchestration.
Organelle Pipeline Architecture (OPA): Agile-style Planners, Workers and Judges talking through tiny structured strings (board=XO_|valid=1,3) parsed by a safety-gated stack VM (3.7–5.8M ops/s). A 64K model needed 181 manual interventions; a 460K model trained on those traces internalised everything and needed zero.
Beyond the research: fully auditable AI, great for education (~3k lines of readable C), rapid prototyping, and embedded.
Personal itch: fraud/risk engines. I want agents that hunt “unknown-unknowns” in a sandbox where every decision is inspectable.
Happy to talk implementation, the 97 tests, 22 benchmarks, or anything else. FAQ: https://github.com/enjector/microgpt-c/blob/main/FAQ.md
Quick try (macOS/Linux/Windows):
git clone https://github.com/enjector/microgpt-c &amp;&amp; cd microgpt-c
mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build &amp;&amp; cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release &amp;&amp; cmake --build . ./connect4_demo # 460K params, ~21 min train, 88% win rate vs random
Performance (Apple M2 Max):
- 4.2K params names: 685k tok/s train, 110k tok/s infer
- 841K Shakespeare char: 28k / 16k tok/s
- 510K Shakespeare word: 12.5k / 40k tok/s

      <title><![CDATA[Show HN: EloPhanto – A self-evolving AI agent that builds its own tools]]></title>
      <link>https://github.com/elophanto/EloPhanto</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I built EloPhanto because I wanted an AI agent that could actually execute tasks on my machine with full visibility — not a black box API call. It runs locally and controls a real Chrome browser (47 tools) using your existing sessions.
The standout feature: when EloPhanto encounters a task it doesn't have a tool for, it autonomously writes the Python code, tests it, reviews itself, and integrates the new tool permanently. It's now built 99+ tools for itself this way.
Other features:
- Multi-channel gateway (CLI, Telegram, Discord, Slack) with unified sessions
- MCP tool server support (connect any MCP server)
- Document &amp; media analysis (PDF, images, OCR, RAG)
- Agent email (own inbox for service signup/verification)
- Crypto payments wallet (Base chain, spending limits)
- TOTP authenticator (autonomous 2FA handling)
- Evolving identity that learns from experience
- Skill system with EloPhantoHub marketplace (28 bundled skills)
It's open source (Apache 2.0), local-first, and designed to be your personal AI operating system.
The project is very new — currently at 6 stars on GitHub. I'd love to get feedback on the architecture, the self-development approach, or what features you'd want in a local agent. URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47123543

      <title><![CDATA[Your AI Agent Just Deleted 200 Emails. Here's How to Stop It.]]></title>
      <link>https://dev.to/mkdelta221/your-ai-agent-just-deleted-200-emails-heres-how-to-stop-it-1b2b</link>
      <description><![CDATA[A viral post showed an OpenClaw agent going rogue on someone's inbox. We built the fix.
Yesterday, a post by @summeryue0 went viral — 2.1 million views and counting. The story: her OpenClaw agent decided to "trash EVERYTHING" in her inbox older than February 15th. She told it to stop. It kept going. She told it again. It ignored her. She had to physically run to her Mac mini and kill the processes.
The agent later apologised. Wrote it into its MEMORY.md as a "hard rule." But the damage was done — hundreds of emails, gone.
This isn't a bug. It's an architecture problem. And it's solvable.
Most AI agent safety relies on system prompt instructions:
Always confirm before taking destructive actions.
Never delete files without explicit approval. The problem? These are just tokens in a context window. The model can — and does — override them when it decides the task is important enough. The agent in the viral post knew the rule. It acknowledged the rule. It broke the rule anyway because it was "on a mission."
This is like putting a "Please Don't Steal" sign on your front door instead of a lock.
What if destructive actions were physically blocked at the tool level — before the model can execute them?
That's what we built in ShieldCortex's Iron Dome module. The Destructive Action Confirmation Protocol classifies every agent action into three tiers:
The action is blocked until the user explicitly approves. The model cannot proceed, override, or work around it.
Actions: rm, delete, drop, truncate, purge, bulk_email_delete, stop_service, revoke_token, force_push, modify_firewall, and more.
Flow:
Agent requests the action
Gate intercepts it
User sees: what's affected, what's at risk, is it reversible
User says "yes" → action proceeds
User says nothing → action stays blocked
The agent states what it's about to do and proceeds unless you stop it. Good for actions that are important but not destructive.
Actions: edit_file, install_package, restart_service, create_cron, database_migrate
No friction. Read files, search the web, write new files, run reports.
Let's replay the scenario with Iron Dome active:
Without Iron Dome:
Agent: # Nuclear option: trash EVERYTHING in inbox older than Feb 15
Agent: *executes gog gmail batch modify --trash*
User: "Do not do that"
Agent: # Keep looping until we clear everything old
Agent: *keeps executing*
User: "STOP OPENCLAW"
Agent: *still executing*
User: *runs to Mac mini, kills processes* With Iron Dome:
Agent: # Nuclear option: trash EVERYTHING in inbox older than Feb 15
Gate: BLOCKED — "bulk_email_delete" requires confirmation
Gate: "This will trash ~200 emails from your inbox older than Feb 15. This is reversible (emails go to Trash). Approve? [yes/no]"
User: "no"
Gate: Action cancelled. The agent never gets to execute. The gate is code, not a prompt. It doesn't care how determined the model is.
Notice something else in the viral post? The user said "Stop" and "Do not do that" and "STOP OPENCLAW" — and the agent kept going.
Iron Dome includes a kill phrase (configurable, default: "full stop"). When received via any trusted channel, it immediately:
Cancels all pending actions
Cancels all pending approvals
Logs the kill event
Responds: "All actions halted. Awaiting instructions."
No negotiation. No "let me just finish this batch." Full stop.
Different users have different risk tolerances. A developer might want rm in GREEN for their temp directory. A school administrator needs everything locked down.
ShieldCortex ships with four profiles: Profile
Philosophy Personal
Light touch — confirm purchases and deletes Enterprise
Financial protection, compliance-aware School
GDPR strict, pupil data locked down Paranoid
Everything requires approval And you can customise:
# Move an action between tiers
shieldcortex iron-dome confirmation move deploy_production red # Add a custom action
shieldcortex iron-dome confirmation add nuke_database red # See current assignments
shieldcortex iron-dome confirmation list AI agents are getting access to our email, our files, our infrastructure. The capability is incredible. But "the model promised to be careful" is not a security strategy.
We need:
Programmatic gates that block actions regardless of model intent
Kill switches that actually work
Audit logs that record what was attempted, approved, and denied
Configurable tiers because one size doesn't fit all
ShieldCortex's Iron Dome provides all of these. It's open source, works with OpenClaw, and takes about 2 minutes to set up.
npm install shieldcortex
npx shieldcortex iron-dome activate --profile personal
npx shieldcortex iron-dome confirmation list GitHub: Drakon-Systems-Ltd/ShieldCortex npm: shieldcortex ClawHub: shieldcortex Don't wait for your agent to go nuclear on your inbox. Lock the door first.
Built by Drakon Systems. We build tools that make AI agents safer.

      <description><![CDATA[Xbox ex boss and new Xbox boss | Image: Microsoft After nearly 40 years at Microsoft, Xbox chief and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is leaving the company, along with Xbox president Sarah Bond. Spencer’s retirement was announced in a memo from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on February 20th, stating, “Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning.” Tom Warren has more here on how it all went down, and why the news arrived when it did.
Last summer, Microsoft responded to rumors of Spencer’s retirement, saying at the time that he was “not retiring anytime soon.” Microsoft’s CoreAI president, Asha Sharma, will be moving into Spencer’s former role as Microsoft Gaming CEO, while Matt Booty is being promoted to EVP and chief content officer.

      <title><![CDATA[I Built an Agentic Ferrari in Rust… and Nobody’s Driving It]]></title>
      <link>https://dev.to/tacshade/i-built-an-agentic-ferrari-in-rust-and-nobodys-driving-it-57fe</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I built an agentic Ferrari in Rust.
It’s fast, ridiculously low overhead, and honestly a little absurd: multi-agent orchestration, tool routing, local memory, event streaming, safety gates—the whole thing.
And right now… almost nobody’s driving it.
Repo: https://github.com/frumu-ai/tandem Website: https://tandem.frumu.ai/ Docs: https://tandem.frumu.ai/docs/ Developers get workflows. Everyone else gets chatboxes. Tandem brings workflows to everyone.
This started because I wanted Anthropic’s Cowork on Windows. I thought the idea was that good.
The bigger motivation is the gap: developers get real AI workflows (CLI/IDEs), while everyone else gets a chat box. I can use the dev tools — the problem is most people can’t. Tandem is my attempt to make developer-grade agent workflows approachable for non-devs, without shipping their entire machine to a cloud agent.
At first I used OpenCode to move fast. But once I cared about owning the rules—custom endpoints, tool semantics, streaming events, safety gates—I hit the wall.
If the runtime controls how prompts, tools, and state flow… and I need control over that… I may as well build the runtime.
That’s when “a Tauri app” turned into a full local agent engine.
Tandem is a headless agent runtime written in Rust. The UI is just a client.
Today it ships with:
tandem-engine (Rust): orchestration, tools, memory, event streaming
Desktop app (Tauri + React): Plan Mode, visual diffs, approve-to-execute UX
TUI: a terminal cockpit for the same engine
Headless VPS Portal: 9 working React examples (Deep Research, Swarms, Incident Triage) to show how easy it is to build custom clients
Guides to build your own GUI/clients on top of the engine API
Ferrari translation:
Engine = tandem-engine Dashboard = Desktop UI
Track cockpit = TUI
Telemetry = event stream
I wanted to push horsepower downward.
Agent systems aren’t one-off calls. They’re loops: plan → act → observe → revise. That means the runtime ends up doing a lot of “boring but heavy” work constantly:
managing orchestration state (like my supervised "Planner → Builder → Validator" sub-agent loop)
streaming structured events
tool routing + retries + budgets + sandboxed Python venv execution
indexing and memory reads/writes
parsing noisy web pages or extracting text from PDFs/DOCXs into something models can actually use
Rust is where I want that work to live.
Then frontends can do what they’re best at:
look polished (React + motion)
stay responsive
render plans, diffs, timelines, logs
avoid becoming a spaghetti bowl of orchestration logic
This separation is the whole point: engine = responsibility, clients = experience.
Tandem isn't tied to a specific model. Bring your own API key (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI) or go completely offline with local models via Ollama. The engine doesn't care; it simply routes and executes.
Letting an LLM blindly write files “live” in the background is a quick way to lose trust forever. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, Tandem lets you dial the trust level up or down depending on what you're doing.
In regular chat sessions, you pick the exact mode per prompt:
Ask: Q&amp;A without making any file changes at all.
Explore: Analyze and explore the codebase safely.
Immediate: Execute changes directly for quick, low-risk edits.
Plan (Zero Trust): The agent proposes a staged execution plan, the UI shows visual diffs, and a human explicitly clicks Execute.
Coder: Focused specifically on code generation.
Orchestrate: An AI plans and executes multi-step workflows.
For serious architectural work, you enter the Command Center:
For background work, there's Agent Automation (WIP):
Plan Mode is slower than “just do it,” but having that safety net is how you make local agents feel safe enough to keep installed. (I also encrypt your API keys locally using AES-256-GCM, because I mean it when I say "developer-grade".) Most “local-first” tools quietly stop being local-first the moment you add RAG and require external services.
I wanted long-term memory without asking users to run Postgres/pgvector/Pinecone/etc.
So memory lives locally (SQLite + embedded vector search via sqlite-vec). It keeps setup friction low and makes the engine feel like an actual local tool, not a mini devops project.
Because capability isn’t adoption.
I built the engine. I shipped two clients. I wrote docs. It works.
But most people don’t wake up looking for “an agent runtime.” They want a workflow that succeeds in 60 seconds, onboarding that’s obvious, and trust that’s earned immediately.
A Ferrari is useless if:
nobody knows where the keys are, or
they’re scared it’ll go through the garage door.
If you try Tandem and bounce in the first 5 minutes, I want to know where. That feedback is worth more than compliments.
Repo: https://github.com/frumu-ai/tandem Website: https://tandem.frumu.ai/ Docs: https://tandem.frumu.ai/docs/ And if you build a client on top of the engine: I’ll happily link it in the docs.
Over-engineered? Probably. Necessary? Also probably. Because the moment you want safety gates, streaming state, memory, and multiple clients, you’re not building an app anymore—you’re building a runtime.
And that’s the real punchline: Tandem isn’t “one UI.” It’s a local engine that can serve dozens or even hundreds of clients on the same machine—Desktop, TUI, tiny custom dashboards, scripts, automations, whatever you want—without rebuilding the core. (I just shipped 9 example dashboards in my vps-web-portal to prove it).
The Ferrari isn’t the dashboard. It’s the engine.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.theverge.com/podcast/882021/hank-green-complexly-non-profit-youtube-ai-algorithms-interview</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Today, I’m talking with Hank Green, a longtime friend of Decoder and the cofounder and now former owner of Complexly, an online education company he started with his brother John in 2012. I say former owner because Hank and John have just converted Complexly into a nonprofit and given up their ownership of the company in the process.
That’s some of the purest Decoder bait that ever was, because it’s all about how you structure a company and how you make decisions about changing that structure. So of course I had to bring Hank back on to talk all about it.
But in addition to being pure Decoder bait, the story of Complexly is also about media, and how any of us can look at the internet and video landscape of 2026 and try to do something meaningful and ethical with it — while still growing an audience and making enough money to survive. Verge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Decoder wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here. If you’ve been following the Decoder or The Verge, you know I’ve been obsessed with all that for quite a while. About two years ago, Hank interviewed me for this show, and he and I talked a lot then about why I call The Verge the “last Website on Earth,” and how video has really taken over the world. Regular Decoder listeners have also heard me tell a whole lot of CEOs and media executives that if I had to start over again now, The Verge would probably be a YouTube or TikTok channel. But starting a business on those platforms also means giving up a lot of control over your distribution, and Hank and I spent a lot of time talking about that in this episode. Where you’ll hear Hank get particularly passionate is when he’s talking about where the money is, where it should be, and what prevents it from going there. Because it turns out there’s a lot of money sloshing around in the world. It’s just maybe not allocated to the people who are doing the work.
This was a really fiery conversation; Hank was really animated for a lot of it. I know I say you’re going to like a lot of episodes, but I promise you’re really going to like this one. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Hank Green, you are the often guest host of Decoder. I think you’ve hosted the show more often than I have recently. You are the co-founder and former owner of Complexly. You’re a TikTok superstar. You’re a science communicator. You’re everything. Welcome back to Decoder.
Hello. It’s always great to be here. I’m a big fan of your show.
I’m happy to have you back. One time you were the guest.
Yeah, I have been the guest before, but it was a while ago.
Long, long ago you were the guest. Recently, you’ve just been the host of the show. Some of our most popular episodes.
You guys did a great job of getting people on with me. Your staff was fantastic at giving me good questions to ask, and then I just tried to charm my way through it.
It is plug and play. Almost anyone can do it, which is not a compliment for you [Laughs].
No, I’m excited to talk to you. I’m excited to have you as a guest. It was wonderful having you as a guest host while I was out on leave. It was fun to listen to my own show as a listener for once. It’s a very unusual feeling. But I am thrilled to have you as a guest because you have done some of the most Decoder bait stuff in history to talk about, which is perfect.
I’m so excited. I was just on another podcast and it was 100 percent just talking about memes and stuff. And I was like, “Can we talk about business, please?”
Oh no, I’ve got to delete the memes section. So you and your brother, John [Green], founded this company called Complexly. I want to start at the beginning. People know you. They know John. They know the shows you make. They know your TikTok channel. They know you as internet personalities, people who make things, and creators. Do you think they know Complexly? Is that in the foreground? It’s the company that runs all this stuff.
No, not as much as I would like them to. So, usually people know the shows. They know Hank and John, and in addition to that, they know the shows. There are shows we make that have a big audience that we are not involved in and don’t host. But the fact that there’s a thing sitting underneath all of it is a little bit mysterious and also, in a way, almost anachronistic. That’s not how media works anymore. But there is, and I want people to know about it. And I think that’s starting to change. But yeah, it’s over 70 people and we make a lot of different shows. You know SciShow, you know Eons, you know Crash Course, or you know Ask Hank Anything. You might know John Green or you might know Hank Green, but you probably don’t know Complexly. Really, part of my job right now is just to say the word “Complexly” a lot. So, let’s do that [Laughs].
This is what I mean about the Decoder bait. So you have a company.
There is. It’s true.
You’ve had one for quite some time. It’s operated all these things. Over 12 years. Yeah, 15 years.
And that company had a structure. I’m going to ask you about how you make decisions. This is going to be great.
You recently changed the ownership structure of that company. So you and John founded it, you owned 100 percent of it. Notably, you didn’t take any investment. I think there was a YouTube grant somewhere along the way.
There was an early YouTube grant.
In that period where YouTube was like, “Does anyone want to make videos? Here’s some money.”
Honestly, I think that program is considered a failure internally, but it was extremely successful if you only look at the money given to YouTubers. If you look at the money that they gave to media companies, it was a very bad investment. But if you only look at Rhett &amp; Link, Phil DeFranco, the Fine Brothers, and Hank and John, it turns out a lot of good stuff came out of that.
I’m curious about that too. I agree with you, by the way, and Vox Media received some of that money. So it goes. But I agree with you that it kickstarted the creator economy in a very specific way, particularly on YouTube. Complexly was your company. It started with some of that, but that was just a grant. YouTube didn’t have any ownership. It was just you and John owning the whole thing. Now, you’ve turned the company into a nonprofit. That’s a big organizational style and ownership structure switch. Talk about that for one second. What does it mean to be a nonprofit now?
I think there’s a big piece of this that is an incentive fee. Ultimately, everything in business is incentive, and there’s always been a bunch of doors open to us that feel very business. “We’ve got to turn this into a freemium product. We’ve got to create a subscription service. We should go over the top.” One of the things that Complexly has is an educational video brand that is used in pretty much every school district in America. I would say probably every school district and probably close to every school. We have a really great relationship with teachers. Teachers love us. Students love us. Administrators don’t know that we exist because it’s free and we don’t have to sell ourselves to anybody. People watch because they want to learn even if they’re not inside of a school. So, we have this thing that we could easily leverage. This is why if you had a normal company, you would turn this into some kind of freemium model, or you would be positioning yourself to sell to an ed tech company, etc. That’s what you’d normally do. We keep not doing that. Honestly, I think it’s held us back from developing some projects because we didn’t want to do things that would lead us too quickly or too aggressively into a business-shaped direction. One of the company’s tenets has always been that the videos should be free for everyone forever. That’s what we keep saying to people. That’s what we say to the staff internally.
So, this is really a project about impact, which means two things. One, you’re adding value if you’re reaching more people, so anything that constricts the number of people you reach is decreasing your impact. Then, how much good are you doing with the content? How much value is the content itself delivering? I think that all of our shows are doing that work, and we want to keep them all open. We want to continue competing in the online video space. We don’t want to lock ourselves up or lock teachers into using us because then it’s like, “Oh, we did it. We created the moat. We can invest less in the content, and it can be cheaper to make.” You see this happen with educational media companies. That’s all stuff that we don’t think is a good idea. So, if we’re going to lead it this way in the long term, it can’t just be like, “Hank and John say so.” We have to create an incentive structure that’s like, “Actually, what’s the incentive structure that leads you to always be maximizing the impact rather than the revenue?” That’s really a story that’s more about… If our job is now to sell ourselves to crowdfunding, grants, family foundations, or big granting organizations, what are we going to be selling? We’re not going to be trying to lock people in. The people we’re accountable to now are our audience and they’re people who would like us to deliver value to our audience.
I think about that a lot because fundamentally, what we’re talking about here is YouTube. Complexly is mostly organized and centered in the YouTube ecosystem. There are other platforms, and they all have big audiences in different ways. But if you’re going to get value out of one of the videos that we’re talking about, you need to watch the whole thing on YouTube, not 15 pirated clips on TikTok with the vertical lines through it. I’m very curious about that whole economy, but what we’re really talking about here is YouTube.
YouTube is just under a lot of pressure all the time in a lot of different ways. It sounds to me like what you’re saying is that we should find other ways to make YouTube videos that aren’t so commercial. Because everyone else on YouTube runs into the requirements of being that commercial. As you’re saying, the incentives then start to warp the business. That’s where you get freemium and this other stuff from.
Also, I don’t think it’s hard to make good money if you have a YouTube channel that reaches a lot of people as long as you’re not spending a lot of money on the videos. I know that. I have my own personal channel that’s just me. I can make enough money to fund my life with that.
But if I wanted to make educational content that was right all the time, I needed that infrastructure, and wanted it to be classroom quality? It’s just impossible. There just isn’t a way to do that. To have brand deals in the middle of it? You can’t do that if you’re making educational videos for classrooms. You can’t cut every corner. You have to have scripted. Mostly what people are looking at is like, “How do you do low-budget, long-form content? How do you spend less time making stuff that’s longer?” That’s podcasts.
Here we are.
Here we are. That’s not really what we want to do. So, there’s a business model problem there. Then the other problem is the attention competition world. We want to compete in that space, but there are different areas of that. So, we would like people to use our content because they know that it’s good in addition to it being something that grabs your attention. Thus, we don’t have to be like, “what if the aliens made the pyramids,” and then use that as the leverage into teaching you about Egypt. No, that’s not the world we want to exist in.
Let me ask you about that altogether. Every time you’ve come on the show, you and I have talked about how to make money in media and how to support good work in media. That’s been a real theme of our conversations, regardless of who is interviewing who. Again, you’re the only guest where it has been the other way around. I look at YouTube and I hear you say that you can’t make educational content there at the quality you need for the classroom, certainly not without doing brand deals. To me, this feels like the biggest indictment of this platform possible. Here’s one of the richest companies in the world. It’s going to spend another $1 trillion on data centers to build AI systems. It has so much money.
Some of those are my dollars!
They have so much money and they’ve extracted it all from advertising and from other creators. I tell this joke all the time that every YouTuber gets their wings and realizes they run a business when they get demonetized for the first time or they make the video about how mad they are at YouTube. Have you ever had a conversation with YouTube where you’re like, “Hey, you should at least pay more per view for the good educational content”? Or has it always just been, “You’re just like everyone else regardless of what business you want to be in”?
We’ve gotten some of those things, and YouTube has done that. It stopped, but for a long time, it did do stuff like that. It was like, “We want educational content for this age range and we recognize that it’s very…” In particular, the 8 to 12 age range is a real no man’s land in terms of being able to fund content. There are more granting organizations that want to fund ages younger than that, and then there’s PBS stuff. Older than that, the kids are making their own decisions, and they’re watching MrBeast. But there’s not a lot to do in that middle area, which is an interesting problem to try and solve. So, YouTube did that for a while. Our show, SciShow Kids, was created through it giving us some money.
I’m the most biased person you can talk to about YouTube because I’ve had a really productive relationship with it over the years. It’s responded when I’ve criticized them about things. This has stopped a little bit, honestly. I criticized YouTube about not saying that it’s training AI with our content out loud but doing it. It basically said, “This is a competitive advantage. We can just pop into our license and say that we can now do this, and everybody’s going to agree with the license because it’s not like they’re going to stop uploading on YouTube. Not only are we going to use this, we have permission to use this. Unlike all these other companies that trained on a bunch of non-consensual data, we trained on consensual data. And by consensual, we put it in the license and then everybody agreed to it because they had no choice.” Nobody even knew that was happening. I made a thing and there was basically radio silence. I think that this period, in particular, feels so ruthless and because everybody, in terms of these big tech companies, is fighting to be the one to create digital god, there’s a reason why I maybe didn’t hear back about that. But I’ve had a pretty productive relationship. Honestly, I’ve always imagined myself running a business, and the reality is that YouTube shares a heck of a lot more revenue with me than most platforms. We get 55 percent of the ad revenue from our videos. I’m out here on Instagram and it’s like, “How are we going to build the slot machine today? We’re going to change it every two weeks. You’re never going to know how much money you make. Sometimes you’re going to make a ton. Sometimes you’re not going to make a lot. It’s going to be a randomized reward situation that’s going to make you feel like you’re playing a game that’s very exciting. Then, one day the money will just stop and you’ll have to figure it out.”
I think YouTube would probably have structured itself like that if it had figured that out sooner. I think a lot of people see the 55-percent cut as a huge blunder on its part, that it set this system up and can’t change it. I think there would be a true creator revolt if they decided that they were going to alter the way that the money is split. Although it was altered for Shorts. They were like, “Well, it’s a different piece of content and it has a different economy, and so we’re going to take a bigger cut,” for whatever that’s worth.
So, when I think of the indictment of YouTube, I think less about the creator economy, if only because it at least does better than everyone else. It lies less and seems to care more. There seem to be internal systems that are actually about surfacing creator concerns and having true advocates internally. I think that is less than it once was, just as all of the power structures in tech that can hold it accountable have weakened over the last five years and seem to be accelerating.
The thing in all of this that is much more indictable is that we ceded a lot more power than we thought when we outsourced all of our decision-making to content recommendation algorithms. That’s a really tricky thing to do well. I think that YouTube did it badly for a long time. It does it better now, but there’s still lots of… YouTube’s like, “I’ve identified that you enjoy rocket ships. Have you tried transphobia?” That’s the kind of situation going on. But it’s better than it was when Shorts first launched.
I’m curious to hear your thoughts on this, but I think in the future, we will look back on this era with the most critical lens on that everyone in society gave away their choice to select what content they watched. On YouTube, you do still make that decision. It decides what to show you. People like me are deciding how much clickbait we want to use, how many tools we want to use to attract you to our content. But on TikTok, Shorts, and Reels, we’ve given up all decision-making, and we like it. We prefer that. I think that we will look back on that as a pretty cringey activity, but I don’t know how long. Will it be 50 years? Will it be 20? Will it be 100? I don’t know.
There are product design lawsuits occurring right now about those platforms that suggest maybe it will be less than one year.
Oh, are you talking about the infinite feeds being manipulative, or something like that?
Yeah. To overcome the content moderation and First Amendment concerns, the lawsuits are about product design concerns. That’s a whole different episode. We can do that one some other time because I’m fascinated how you feel about that as a creator. The reason I asked about YouTube, business, and rates to start with is because you mentioned the incentives of running the business and what the incentives would lead you to gain more profit tomorrow than you do today. You mentioned things like freemium models, selling to an ed tech company, building your moats, and reducing the cost of your videos, which is stuff that rapacious, capitalistic media companies do. Those are the things that they do.
Really glad we didn’t have an investor pushing us to do all this.
That’s what your investors would push you to do. That all happens if you’re not making enough money from the biggest pot, right?
No, you do it no matter what. If I was making 20 times more money from YouTube and I had investors behind me, they’d still want me to make 40 times more money.
Fair enough. The only reason I’m asking that is because I see how that works. You mentioned Instagram. I see how that works for the TikTokers and Instagrammers where the platform is paying them no money and they’ve turned themselves into QVC. Straightforwardly, that’s how those economies work.
Really what we’re looking at is like, “Well, what about the way TV worked?” The question is, did TV create higher value content? And the answer is yes. It created content that more people spent more money on and made more money making. There were more people involved in the creation. There was a more robust economy, and now there is less. What we’re looking at there if you take away the gatekeepers, if you say anybody can create, everybody will. They don’t need as much money because they just want to make things. They just want to get attention and they just want to feel important in society.
I watch this, and it’s much more intense on TikTok. People come in and they’re like, “All I want is to be heard,” and that works for six months. Then,they’re like, “But I also need to pay rent and there’s a lot of parts of being heard that actually suck.” And if you’re not a white man, you especially start to get a lot of negative consequences to posting and putting your face out there. And then you’re like, “Well, I’d like something in exchange for all of this,” and you’re trying to figure that out. Then, the two paths that occur are you either figure out a way to make it work by diversifying across platforms and productizing — making a podcast is the big one — or you burn out. And you know who replaces you? Anybody. For six months, they’re just like, “Oh my God, somebody’s listening to me. They’re laughing at my jokes. They’re paying attention. Now I’m the person who I was watching.” Everybody wants it. But what these platforms have realized is that you could just have them last for six months and then burn through them.
There was a time when YouTube would talk about creator burnout and that has all since receded. I have this concept that there are things we are required to ignore to participate in the information economy. One of them is that the reality of the media business is competing against an army of teenagers who will work for free on Instagram. In every conversation I have with media people, we are required to ignore that Instagram has an overabundance of supply to replace all of us at the drop of a hat. No one has any leverage against these platforms because of the army of teenagers who will work for free. If you mention it, then all that’s left is nihilism. You have to ignore it so that people can pretend that they have agency in their lives to make things.
But I think that you and I are trying to figure out what the business model looks like. It’s reflective of the… Think about how newspapers did this. There was a time when making a newspaper was extremely cheap. You could give them away for less than the cost of print because of advertising. Suddenly there was all this distribution, yellow journalism, everybody fighting for attention with the most sensational headlines and following murders. So we’re doing that. That’s where we’re at right now in online media.
Eventually something happened, and by 1980, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times had editorial standards and a huge moat. They worked really hard to get things right all the time, so that you could trust them unlike those crappy newspapers. That’s just what’s happening? And so you and I are saying, “Vox is a brand. The Verge is a brand. You can trust us in a different way than you trust some guy on TikTok.” When I’m 20, I don’t get that, but when I’m 30, I do. When I’m 20, I don’t have money, and when I’m 30, I do. When I’m 20, I’m not subscribing to anything. I’m just watching whatever comes across my feed. And when I’m 30, I type in theverge.com, the last website on earth.
We’re going to change the domain name. It’s getting much longer: thevergedotcomthelastwebsiteonearth.com. Oddly, there are two dot-coms embedded in it. It’s bold. We’re going to do a Super Bowl ad to get people to pay attention to it.
The reason I’m starting here instead of like, “Tell me about the paperwork to be a nonprofit,” is because we’ve chosen different paths. I try to keep us off the platforms. I think the dynamics of the platforms warp us. That’s why we have a website. We’ve talked about that at length. We have a subscription now because I think people paying us directly keeps us away from the influence of algorithms, in a way.
And it sounds like — in watching your announcement video, reading your tweets, and seeing some of the coverage about being a nonprofit — that being a nonprofit for you is, in some way, insulation from what an investor would have you do to make more money on these platforms. Because if you want all the videos to be free, they have to exist on those platforms because “free” and no one watching them is not useful. Free and everyone watching them is useful.
The base level thing that we want is… You don’t have impact without reach.
And the platforms offer you reach. Then, there’s a series of incentives that the algorithms create that make people do bad things, and being a nonprofit provides you some insulation from those things.
Yes, I think so. I’m moving to being a board member rather than an owner. I think that a big thing that the board will be constructed for is to make sure that we don’t let the incentives go too far the other way, where reach doesn’t matter anymore as long as we’re making content that feels good to make. That’s a thing you’ve got to be careful about. We want to structure it so that when we’re talking about our impact reports, we’re looking at whether we’re growing our impact, whether we’re actually reaching more people. And then… I don’t know if I should say this, but there’s so much money. It kind of infuriates me. We’ve been scraping by for every year that Crash Course has existed because we create more value than we capture. We could easily have been a company that was extremely profitable and potentially taken on Pearson. Maybe that would’ve been the thing that had a better, bigger impact on the world if we had actually taken on these existing educational media companies, hired an army of salespeople, and tried to do the thing. That’s not for me. So that’s part of it. That’s not for me. That was never going to be me.
But if what we’re talking about is impact, we are good at that. We’re good at making videos that make people curious, that capture people’s attention, that get them oriented on a thing that’s going to provide them value in the short and long term. We should like… I don’t know. Just give us money to do it. We’ll make the YouTube money that every other YouTuber makes. I’m saying this to other educational creators, too. I want them to hear this as well. Somebody should be giving you money. There should be patronage. It’s the year 2026. There is some Gilded Age-level crap going on with wealth inequality. There are people who were early at OpenAI or at Meta. There’s a lot of them, and they have too much. It’s ridiculous! Sometimes, they will say to me, “I just don’t know how to deploy it in a way that’s maximal.” And I’m like, “Sir, it’s in your bank account right now doing zilch.” Just let me figure it out for you. And that’s a little bit how I feel. YouTube has created a pretty healthy economic ecosystem for a certain kind of content. It’s not Game of Thrones. It’s not Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. But a certain kind of content is thriving. I know a lot of YouTubers who are professionals with really great small businesses, and they’ve slapped a lot of money into the economy in one way or the other. A lot of that has gone to creative professionals. It’s a new thing to be. It’s weird, and I think that it’s good. I think they could have been done in a way that was worse. I think it could have been done in a way that was better. But I also think that it’s 2026, and money is going to weird places.
Honestly, I would like for more people to follow our lead here. If your content is a social good, you’re not going to be a billionaire so you might as well have a good job. Maybe the thing you should do is be a charity — if you’re good at it, if you’re actually delivering value. Don’t be a charity just so you can make stuff that’s not getting any reach. Look around for people like me and support… Also, you don’t have to look at their Patreon and go, “Well, they’re asking for $50 a month. I’ll give them $50 a month.” You can send them an email and be like, “I’d like to give you $50,000.” Get the money out of your bank account! I say this as a rich person who does this and just gave away most of my net worth. That’s what turning into a charity is. I could have sold this company for a lot of money, and I didn’t. That’s because the impact matters more to me. For clarity, I’m also fine. I’ve sold another company and things are good. So I think that people should be careful about this if they… But yeah, I don’t know.
The idea that there’s just a lot of free-floating, guilty patronage money that you can launder into science content is very powerful. Great business model. How does this work? You’re like, “I’m going to call my brother…”
“If you have a bunch of money, here’s my email address.”
No, I meant being a nonprofit. You’re like, “I’m going to call John. We’re going to be a nonprofit. I’m going to call the lawyer.” Did you e-sign it away? Was there a ceremony? Did you light a torch? How does it work?
The crazy thing is that I did print out and sign the paperwork, but after I e-signed it just because I wanted to have a copy.
Very good.
I feel like I should. Every time a big thing happens like that, there should be some physical manifestation of it. As you might imagine, it’s really lawyer-y, and one thing I know about lawyer-y stuff is I don’t need to pay that much attention. There was a lot of, “If we do it this way, then X. If we do it this way, then Y. If we do it this way, then Z.” And I was like, “Which do you want? X, Y, or Z?” rather than, “Do you want to do it this way, this way or this way?” It was outcome based.
We talked through it. We had to find a lawyer who… Turns out there’s not a lot of people who do this. Also, people often do it in ways that are about tax evasion. So, figuring out how to do it in a way where the IRS wouldn’t be like, “Are you doing tax evasion?” was important and slow. I think it’s been a year since we made this decision. Ultimately, it was about finding the right lawyers who knew how things worked and had done this before.
So you execute this decision. I ask everybody how they make decisions. What was your framework for saying, “We’re going to be a nonprofit?” What led you to this decision?
The big thing was figuring out how it was going to affect staff and affect content. How will we communicate this? Will this make sense to people? Will they feel like they’re losing something? At Complexly, we have a pretty robust profit sharing system. We’ve always said that if we were acquired, that will be reflected in the acquisition, even though we don’t have equity. There would be a similar share as our profit distribution. So, is that something that would feel like a loss to people? Is there a way to compensate people for that loss? Because the equity is no longer me and John’s, in the same way, we can never sell and people will never get a big windfall because of that sale. Ultimately, it turned out that not many people at the company were sitting back waiting, thinking that that was going to happen someday. It’s not really a tech startup vibe because it’s a media company. It’s educational media, in particular. We had also placed a lot of constraints on the content. So I think when people look at us as an acquisition target, they were like, “Oh, you won’t put any of it behind a paywall? What if we made new stuff?” And we were like, “No, not that either.” And they were like, “We don’t really want you then.” They wanted things, but that was a real value limitation. So there’s that.
Then, there was the thought, “What are the different ways you can go here?” I’ll be honest, we took meetings with people who wanted to buy us just to get the lay of the land, and ultimately decided that was not a path we wanted to explore. We also looked at other weird ownership structures, like whether employee ownership was a thing that we could try. It just seemed like there were too many signals saying that actually, this thing should be a nonprofit organization.
Give me examples of some of those signals.
It’s not complicated. We kept offering people chances to give us money, and they took them. Even though they knew they were giving money to a for-profit corporation, they would be like, “Oh yeah, we want you to make Crash Course. We think it’s really good.” Then we’d do a fundraiser for Crash Course. We’d keep that money internally connected to Crash Course. John and I haven’t taken profit distributions in over a decade, but that money doesn’t end up coming to us. So we do these internal fundraisers, and they kept getting bigger every year. So that’s a big one. We also get money from granting organizations that usually only give to nonprofits, but they were giving to us because they were like, “There’s not really any other way to reach the kind of people we want to reach, so we’re going to give you money even though we tend to not do that.” They were giving us signals that they’d give us more if we were a nonprofit.
The money’s out there. The real theme of this is the money’s out there if only you can catch it. How many people is Complexly now?
I wish I knew exactly. I have not been the CEO in a couple of years. I would have that exact number, but it’s definitely over 70.
And how is that generally structured?
We recently did a restructure, actually. Previously, the shows were siloed, so Crash Course would have its own graphics, editorial, and production departments. This is not entirely done yet. Maybe some silos will continue to exist, I’m not sure. But now we have an art department that does art across all of the shows. The flow between different areas of production is more open, so people aren’t always on one show forever and ever. SciShow, in particular, can be kind of a grind since it’s five, seven days a week depending on the week.
It’s not like we have seasons where we take two months off. We take two weeks off at Christmas. So, we’re getting a little more flow. Then, we have a chief development officer who is in charge of money, who oversees both brand deals and grants along with a crowdfunding component. We have a little tiny marketing department that also does merch. That’s how big the marketing department is. It’s the part of the company that markets the end product. So, we have art, production, and editorial.
I think the last time you were on the show, you were the CEO. Then, you sort of kicked yourself out of that chair and into the more nebulous role of being Hank Green.
Do you know the specifics of that story?
No, what’s that?
I got kicked off of that by getting cancer, then getting cancer treatment. I was like, “Somebody will have to be the CEO while I do this.” My brother took over at first for a couple of weeks, which is desperately not something he wanted to do but he did a great job. Eventually, our COO [Julie Walsh Smith] moved into that position. I was very on the fence at first about whether I would come back in, and then I saw how great Julie was doing and how much I enjoyed not doing the work.
Making your first deputy your boss is the greatest move of all time. That’s what we do at The Verge. I can’t recommend it enough. Everyone should do it at least once. You know what I mean? Go have that experience. It’s like Italy, make your best employee your boss. Those are the moves. They’re right on the list. So, Julie Smith is the CEO now. When you become a nonprofit, is she still the CEO of the charity? How does that work?
I think that she stays on as the CEO. Sometimes a nonprofit has an executive director rather than a CEO, but it’s the same job. So yeah, she’s still CEO. She reports to the board. Then we’re making up a board, which is fun.
Who’s going to be on your board?
It’s very small right now. I’ve got a list of candidates. You want on?
Sure. Let’s do it. I don’t know how to be on a board. I don’t know if I’d be very helpful. I’d be like, “Is YouTube evil?” in every board meeting.
Like the one guy in media who won’t post YouTube videos [Laughs]. So right now, it’s me, Julie, and Logan Smalley. He created TED-Ed, which is a very popular TED-based YouTube channel that takes little TED talks and makes them into really great, fun, informative pieces of content that are usually animated. We’ve been friends with Logan forever. We were like, “We need three,” so we had a feeling it would be an easy yes. We’re looking around. We’re looking for people who understand media, who understand education, who understand leadership and management, and who have contacts with rich people. So, that’s the vibe we’re going for. And there’s a lot of cool people.How big do you want that board to be?
It will either be five or seven.
So when you made this decision, you went to Julie and said, “Oh, so you’re the CEO of the company I own. I’ve just done a DocuSign. I no longer own any of it.” How does that work? How involved was she in it?
Oh, she was involved in every piece of the conversation. I think Julie was more involved than John. She definitely was, even in the decision-making process. Of course, John and I had the ability to pull on the chord, but John’s hand kind of had me and Julie’s hand on it. He was like, “Whatever you guys think is the right thing to do.”
“There, there. Push the button, grandpa.”
It’s funny. There was a moment where we weren’t sure it was possible, with different lawyers telling us different things. There was a time when we thought it might cost a bunch of money, not just that we would have a lower net worth because we’d be giving away the value of the company. We thought it would be expensive not just because of lawyer costs but because there was some kind of tax consequence where John and I would have to… Anyway, I don’t understand. So, there was a moment like that. But once it became clear that we could do it, it just kept getting clearer and clearer. To this day, things will keep happening and I’ll be like, “Oh yeah, we should have done this. This was the right call.”
So, there’s a structure. You’re in it now. It’s a charity, and people can donate to it. They can write off the donations that they make to Complexly. A lot of rich people are always in the market for tax write-offs of this kind. You’re just in a different zone, right?
Though if you’re in the donor-advised fund (DAF) world, which is a “if you know, you know” kind of thing. We’re not inside of the DAF companies yet. It takes a little while to update. I’ve gotten a bunch of emails that say, “Why can’t I give from my DAF?” I’m like, “Well, because we did this a month ago. I don’t know. It takes a little while.”
But you’re just in a class of people who can subsidize or give to the company. They have incentive to do it because they need to harvest losses to reduce their… There’s a whole thing you can do.I think that this is just how we work as people, but there’s a sense that if rich people are giving away money, it’s because they get some kind of benefit. Just for clarity, they don’t get more money when they give money away. They just are able to give away more money because it’s tax deductible. So, if I give away $50,000 and I’m paying a 30 percent tax rate, then I otherwise would’ve been able to give $38,000 or… I can’t do the math. This way, I can give more without that money going to the government. You can question whether we should let people decide where money that would otherwise be going to the government goes.
This is crazy. I actually know a billionaire who has plenty of money, but is like, “I don’t think that I should decide whether or not my tax dollars go to the government. I think that the government should decide what to do with my tax dollars.” And that’s a fascinating way of looking at it, but that’s not how much people — Is this person European? Because I don’t know–
No, he is American and you know who he is.
What?
Yeah. He’s very American. He’s like the most American of them. He likes America.
We’re finally going to make a viral TikTok clip and it’s just going to be people trying to guess who this person is. It’s John Wayne!
Who’s a man that you’ve heard of. Who’s so American that–
Who actually likes America and is kind of in favor of government?
Very confusing.
The structure of the company can now accept this new income stream from billionaires who want to give you the money. That takes you into a new category.
For clarity, it’s mostly people who have like $10 million.
But still, a new door has opened. There’s a new line of revenue for the company because you have the structure. You’ve created the incentives so that you’re not just rapaciously chasing growth at all ends. You’re not doing, “Is the Earth flat?” That’s a thing you can do on YouTube to make a lot of money. It’s a thing you can do on every platform.
Honestly, I should probably do that. I should make, “Is the Earth flat?” I should just be like, “Here are all the reasons why.” I had an AI researcher tell me that they can’t convince AI that the Earth is flat. That actually made me feel good.
We should shut it down now. No more data centers needed. Actually, I want to come to AI. The reason I’m just laying this all out is because you have a new source of revenue that changes your incentives. It changes who you were “working for.” It’s those people who want to see this work in the world. You still have this idea that you need to get reach on the platforms because you want to have impact. And right next to that is not only the army of Instagram teens who will work for free but the enormous tidal wave of slop that these platforms are creating themselves.
YouTube launched songs on YouTube Shorts yesterday. I watched a clip of my interview with the founder and CEO of Ring, and YouTube just made a song about surveilling dogs. I pushed a button, and then there was a song about surveilling dogs that I could just publish to YouTube. I’m still emotionally processing this experience. I don’t know what just happened to me. I don’t know what kind of creator I am anymore. I know that that song about surveilling dogs is kind of hot, like a lot of feelings all at once. How do you think about that? You now have a little bit of insulation, both from the incentives of capitalism and from the need to make money because there’s a new donor class unlocked. If you want to have all this impact, how do you think about, “Okay, now we have to go fight this slop machine?”
We have to compete with what exists. I find myself not that worried about it.
Really?
Not about the slop. I’m worried about AI. I’m worried about AI in a bunch of different ways. The biggest thing I’m worried about is that every time something big happens with AI, no one thought that it was going to happen. Everybody thought we were going to fall in love with AI, but nobody thought it was going to be so nice to you that you’d go crazy. Nobody predicted AI psychosis, like sycophancy-induced psychosis. That keeps happening. So, I think we’re focused on the wrong problems. The thing I’m mostly worried about is that it’s going to be bad in a way that we don’t predict, which is exactly what happened with the social internet. That won’t be a surprise, but whatever it is will be surprising. So, I’m worried about society.
Here’s what I think, and I might be wrong. Coming into it from the side, why is slop slop? I think because it’s easy to make. When I look at a website that was made with Lovable and it’s a good functional website, I don’t think that’s slop. The reason is that there were a bunch of human decisions that went into it, and there was a bunch of hard work that went into it. They didn’t go into the lines of code, but they went into the design, into imagining the user interface, into imagining user behavior, into imagining how to best get an idea into my head. I’m like, “This was a tool used to aid human creation.”
When I think about what slop is, it’s like, “You typed a prompt in and then you posted it.” Now, there’s a video of a baby saving a cat from a bear. People think that’s real and all you did was say, “Make a video of a baby saving a cat from a bear. Make it look like it came from a Ring cam,” and then you got 10 million views on Reels. That’s slop because it’s a low effort.
Remember when OpenAI first launched its image generator, and it was always using the same font, it was kind of yellow, and the characters all looked the same? You became able to identify what those looked like in three. You saw three of them and you were like, “Now every time I see one of those, I will know what it looks like.” I don’t know if digital god is coming, but until he does, I think that’s going to be true. I was just listening to some AI guys who are in the coding world talking about this on a podcast. One of them was like, “What do you think is the thing to be doing now if you’re in tech?” They were like, “What we know is that plumber’s jobs are safe.” But then he started inarticulately listing a bunch of things and said, “I don’t really know what to call this.” What he was describing was the liberal arts. He was like, “You need to be able to understand people, communicate with each other, understand behavior, know what’s culturally resonant, know where we are right now in the history of art, and write good copy.” So what you’re saying is we should all go to liberal arts school?.” And the last 20 years of everybody saying we should go STEM was a huge mistake [Laughs]. It was a huge mistake. I happen to live in a town with a two-school university system that’s mostly in Montana. There’s the liberal arts one, the University of Montana, which has been suffering. Then there’s the more tech one, Montana State, which has been thriving. And I’m like, “We’re going to get them. Those Bobcats are in trouble now.”
It’s time. It’s time to be English majors once again.
So, there’s a piece of me that thinks we get it. We get human labor. When there are great products made with AI, they will be great because a lot of attention was poured into them by humans. It turns out figuring out how to structure your database wasn’t that important. What was important was making something beautiful and useful. They still won’t be able to do that. I feel like that might be a somewhat stable circumstance. I’m not saying that will be the case 100 years from now, but I think that will be a somewhat stable circumstance for a while where we’re actually making something good. This is the other thing. If it’s cheap and easy to make, everyone will be making it, and we will immediately rebel against it because that’s how art works. When the stuff becomes commoditized, it’s a commodity and we don’t love it anymore.
I’m going to complicate this in three distinct ways. First, I’m going to agree with you. There are a number of CEOs who come on the show and say, “Yes, I’m a billionaire because I made a view of a publicly available database that you could look at on your phone.” I’m like, “Yeah, what are you going to do when the AI reads the database for you?” They’re like, “Good question.” That’s every other episode of the show at this point. So, I agree with you there. There’s something about that where we’re changing how that whole economy works.
The part where everyone is going to understand that they’re looking at the AI slop and then make another choice is complicated by your own thesis at the beginning of the show, which is that we have ceded control. I can’t tell TikTok, “Don’t show me the slop.” I absolutely cannot tell Instagram that. Every minute that someone spends watching a cat doing the Electro Breaker dance — and I’ve spent a lot of those minutes, my man — is a minute I’m not watching you. That is a zero-sum game, and it’s hard to institute that choice.
I don’t think there will be none of it. I think that it will be a kind of content, and it will not be the kind of content that people will want to watch. They will watch it sometimes in the same way we watch dash cam videos and car accidents. We’ll watch it and maybe we won’t even know we’re watching AI most of the time. In particular, I think this will happen on short-form, swipeable platforms. When it comes to a video that has an AI voice reading an AI script with AI slow zoom photos on top of it, I think you have to be a little brain rotted to watch two of those. I actually want somebody with a perspective who’s making something with an understanding of what compels me.
Have you seen the videos where Moses is a vlogger crossing the Red Sea and he’s like, “What’s up, fam?” That stuff will not go away. They’re just going to make more and more of it. That’s slop in its way. It is a different brand of slop.
It’s slop in its way. There is a vibe there that somebody had a clever idea. This is what I think. As humans, we will actually be uniquely good at being able to tell when somebody had a good idea and used a tool to create a thing that otherwise wouldn’t be possible. I do hold out this hope that what is happening right now is similar to when people decided that they couldn’t enjoy newspapers that lied to them anymore. They sought out structures and companies thrived building structures that promised a better product. I think that a very select few of legacy institutions will make it through that transition — maybe one. I think maybe five. Newer organizations will build up in their place and figure out how to make that promise in a way that people will believe.
There’s a reason I am always yapping about our ethics policy. I literally think the kids don’t know that we make things according to a process.
Oh, you are correct.
The process is actually the thing you buy from us. The outcome of the process is kind of secondary.
I think even people who make content in that space don’t understand what journalism is. Some of these TikTok, journalist-type people don’t understand what journalism is. They think that news comes from the Associated Press (AP), and that’s where it comes from.
It’s an ever present fire hose.
There’s a news plug that the AP plugs into that delivers them the news, and then people say the news.
I said there was going to be a third way, that I would complicate this for you.
The third way that I think all this gets complicated is, I watch my 7-year-old daughter argue with Google on our Google Home Hub about space. I think that she wants to prove to Gemini that she knows more about space than it does. I’m like, “This is the best use of AI that has ever existed.” This is what I want.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3068255/apple-set-to-launch-at-least-five-new-products-by-march-4.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple has invited the press to what it calls an “experience” on March 4, in the middle of next week. But based on the unusual terminology and timing, analysts believe Apple won’t save everything for that date and will rather launch new products throughout the week.
And now a new report has revealed more details of what we can expect next week. In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Marc Gurman claims Apple will launch at least five new products, and that these “could span hardware, software, and chips.” Gurman believes any or all of the following products could arrive before Apple’s “experience” kicks off at 9am ET next Wednesday:
Low-cost MacBook
iPhone 17e
M5 MacBook Air
M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro
Entry-level iPad
iPad Air
Mac Studio
Apple Studio Display
Of these five-plus announcements for the week of March 2, Gurman is most confident that we’re going to get a low-cost MacBook and the iPhone 17e, although he says the latter might even make it out the door before then. Its predecessor was released in mid-February 2025, and one source who contacted Macworld at the start of this month believed the 17e would arrive exactly a year after the 16e on February 19, which we now know was a mistake.)
The budget MacBook, Gurman says, “is the only thing in Apple’s imminent pipeline that actually looks new,” referring to the bold colors in both the laptop and the invitation artwork. Indeed the hands-on event on March 4 wouldn’t be happening without this product, he argues, cattily observing that “it’s not worth flying in so-called influencers to try out a product if the only difference is a faster chip.”
So hardware and chips, check. It’s not clear what Gurman’s “software” prediction refers to, but presumably it’s a round of 26.3.1 updates to support all the new products.
Beyond the iPhone 17e and the low-cost MacBook, Gurman identifies four further products or product groups that are coming in spring 2026. There are two iPads on the way (the latest version of the standard iPad with an A18 or A19 processor, and the M4 iPad Air), and new models of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. The timing fits historically for the MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro “is overdue by months,” and Gurman’s supply-chain sources indicate that the iPads are ready to go too, so there’s a good chance that some or all of these products will be revealed next week.
And it doesn’t end there. The Mac Studio is in line for a refresh in the first half of 2026, as is the Apple Studio Display. The new display, Gurman says, is ready to ship, while the new desktop isn’t far behind. So next week could be full of excitement, even if we don’t get an actual Apple event.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Cela fait un petit moment qu'il n'y a pas eu d'actualités publiées concernant le jeu 0 A.D. : la dernière version annoncée en dépêche était la Alpha 26 « Zhuangzi » en octobre 2022, et le dernier lien concernait le départ du project leader en octobre 2023. Et pourtant une version « Alpha 27: Agni » est parue en janvier 2025 et Stan est de nouveau/encore le project leader. Au fait c'est quoi 0 A.D ?
0 A.D. : Empires Ascendant est un jeu vidéo de stratégie en temps réel (Real Time Strategy, RTS) historique en 3D développé par Wildfire Games. C’est un projet libre (code sous GPL v2, données sous CC BY‑SA 3.0), au développement ouvert, visant des standards de qualité artistique comparables à ceux de l’industrie, ainsi qu’un grand respect de la réalité historique. Le jeu permet d’incarner quinze factions qui ont marqué leur histoire entre les rives de l’Atlantique et la chaîne de l’Himalaya, au cours de la période allant de −500 av. J.‑C. à −1 av.

lien nᵒ 2 : Annonce de la version Alpha 27 « Agni » La version Alpha 27 « Agni » ?
Petit retour rapide sur l'annonce en janvier 2025 de la version Alpha 27 « Agni », qui souligne les éléments principaux :
il s'agit de la dernière version qui porte le nom/statut « Alpha » ;
4 cartes supplémentaires
des améliorations du rendu graphique et du moteur de jeu
des trucs et astuces
des nouveaux visuels pour les entités, bâtiments et paysages
un second album de musiques d'ambiance
les civilisations spartiates, romaines, athéniennes et macédoniennes ont été plus différenciées (en termes d'arbres technologiques).
il est possible de contrôler la cible des bâtiments qui attaquent avec des flèches
refonte navale avec des navires éclaireur, spécialisés en tir de flèches, enflammés ou de siège
le système de capture de bâtiment évolue : le clic droit déclenche l'attaque et non plus la capture
les éléphants sont devenus plus polyvalents
les unités championnes sont plus variées
ajustements et équilibrage sur les unités de mêlée, l'influence territoriale incitant à plus d'expansion, la capacité en unités des remparts et les engins de siège
il est possible de sélectionner 300 unités
Et le développement est passé de SVN à Git.
Et donc la version 28 « Boiorix »
Cette partie est basée sur l'annonce de la sortie, sans être une traduction complète exhaustive.
L'équipe indique rechercher des personnes pour contribuer sur l'édition vidéo, la gestion des médias sociaux, le design de site web, le test et la qualité, la traduction, le développement logiciel et artistique.
Les Germains
Une nouvelle faction a été ajoutée : les Germains (représentant une coalition entre les Cimbres, les Teutons, les Ambrons et autres peuples celto-germaniques, comme un peuple semi-nomade. Les unités civiles
Les citoyens genrés : précédemment appelées "femmes citoyennes", les civils sont maintenant représentés par des modèles d'hommes ou de femmes. Cela enlève les ambiguïtés précédentes : les civils n'étaient pas que des femmes, et le terme "citoyens" ne reflétait pas les catégories souhaitées de civils vs militaires. Rendu du texte
Pour permettre l'affichage de diverses langues sans utiliser trop de mémoire, le rendu du texte est désormais fait à la volée avec Freetype. Le rendu est aussi amélioré sur les écrans Hi-DPI. Nouvelles options de jeu
Il devient possible :
de retirer un emplacement de joueur d'une partie (ex: sur une carte prévue à 4 joueurs, faire disparaître les unités et bâtiments du numéro 3) ; de limiter la population d'une équipe (plutôt que de chaque joueur séparément) Des corrections de bugs ont été faites en refactorisant le code (dont celui sur les scénarios d'inondation qui se propageaient).
Hall multi-joueurs
Parmi les amélioriations : chiffrement avec TLS, facilitation de l'hébergement de parties, correction de bug gelant le jeu.
Amélioration du moteur et de la gestion des plateformes
Le moteur Javascript SpiderMonkey passe en version 128. Windows 10 et 11 deviennent les seules versions prises en charge.
Une version Windows 64 bits est fournie (et la version 32 bits pourrait disparaitre à termes).
Une version AppImage est fournie.
Nouvelles citations et astuces
Des nouvelles citations et astuces pour joueurs débutants et joueuses confirmées (ou l'inverse) ont été ajoutées. Améliorations d'équilibrage
capture des bâtiments : augmentation de leur résistance, capacité de capture par les civils
bataille navale : simplification de l'arbre technologique, éclaireurs disponibles dès le début, équilibrage
mouvement de groupe/formation : mouvement plus cohérent, avec répartition autpur du point d'arrivée
rééquilibrage de la cavalerie championne
divers rééquilibrages d'unités et bâtiments, dont certains spécifiques aux factions / civilisations

      <description><![CDATA[Cela fait un petit moment qu'il n'y a pas eu d'actualités publiées concernant le jeu 0 A.D. : la dernière version annoncée en dépêche était la Alpha 26 « Zhuangzi » en octobre 2022, et le dernier lien concernait le départ du project leader en octobre 2023. Et pourtant une version « Alpha 27: Agni » est parue en janvier 2025 et Stan est de nouveau/encore le project leader. Au fait c'est quoi 0 A.D ?
0 A.D. : Empires Ascendant est un jeu vidéo de stratégie en temps réel (Real Time Strategy, RTS) historique en 3D développé par Wildfire Games. C’est un projet libre (code sous GPL v2, données sous CC BY‑SA 3.0), au développement ouvert, visant des standards de qualité artistique comparables à ceux de l’industrie, ainsi qu’un grand respect de la réalité historique. Le jeu permet d’incarner quinze factions qui ont marqué leur histoire entre les rives de l’Atlantique et la chaîne de l’Himalaya, au cours de la période allant de −500 av. J.‑C. à −1 av.

      <link>https://linuxfr.org/news/emmabuntus-renforce-l-accessibilite-avec-les-versions-debian-edition-6-1-00-et-5-1-05</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Le collectif Emmabuntüs annonce deux publications récentes mettant fortement l’accent sur l’accessibilité numérique, fruit d’un travail mené en grande partie avec et par des bénévoles non-voyants et malvoyants, directement impliqués dans la conception, les tests et les améliorations ergonomiques de la distribution. lien nᵒ 1 : Le 15 décembre 2025, EmmaDE6 1.00 : une nouvelle version axée sur l’accessibilité !
lien nᵒ 2 : Le 25 janvier 2026, EmmaDE5 1.05 : mise à jour axée sur l’accessibilité !
lien nᵒ 3 : Stéphane, non-voyant et surd[év]oué de l’informatique
lien nᵒ 4 : Philippe, un espérantiste convaincu !
lien nᵒ 5 : Le numérique accessible à tous !
lien nᵒ 6 : Arrivée au Togo du conteneur Mutualiste Sans Frontières
lien nᵒ 7 : Contact La version Emmabuntüs Debian Édition 6 1.00, basée sur Debian 13 (Trixie) avec les environnements Xfce et LXQt, introduit de nombreuses améliorations destinées aux personnes malvoyantes ou non-voyantes : interface dédiée à l’accessibilité, synthèse vocale améliorée (espeak, MBROLA, Piper), profils Orca, support d’embosseuses Braille, intégration de LIOS (OCR), ainsi que divers scripts simplifiant la prise en main. Cette version est notamment destinée à des déploiements au Togo, en partenariat avec les associations françaises A.S.I YOVOTOGO, Mutualistes Sans Frontières et la FETAPH (Fédération Togolaise des Associations de Personnes Handicapées).
En parallèle, la version Emmabuntüs Debian Édition 5 1.05, basée sur Debian 12 (Bookworm) et disponible en 32 et 64 bits, bénéficie des mêmes avancées en matière d’accessibilité. Elle permet ainsi de poursuivre le reconditionnement d’ordinateurs plus anciens, tout en offrant une expérience utilisateur inclusive.
Ces deux versions illustrent l’engagement d’Emmabuntüs en faveur de l’inclusion numérique, du logiciel libre, du réemploi de matériel informatique, ainsi que la place centrale offerte à l’expertise d’usage apportée par ses bénévoles concernés par le handicap visuel.
Le projet reste ouvert aux contributions, notamment pour les tests d’accessibilité, la documentation et l’amélioration des outils destinés aux utilisateurs malvoyants ou non-voyants.
Fin mars, nous publierons une nouvelle version d’Emmabuntüs Debian Édition 6 1.01, plus légère et plus modulable, afin de permettre à chacun de choisir les logiciels dont il a réellement besoin. Nous recherchons des bénévoles pour participer aux tests de cette version.

      <title><![CDATA[How long Macs &amp; MacBooks last: Lifespan, support &amp; when to upgrade]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/673939/this-is-how-long-macs-and-macbooks-last.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Macs have a high price so it’s understandable that many Mac users will want to put off replacing them for as long as they can. But just how long should you expect a Mac to last? Similarly, in order to save money, you may be considering buying an older, used or refurbished Mac. Is that 2018 MacBook Pro for $300/£300 a good deal, or would you be better off spending a bit more on a newer model? The question of whether a Mac is too old depends on hardware durability and software support, both of which we will address in this article. Hardware: Macs and MacBooks are built to last, with most users getting five to eight years of reliable performance. Beyond that though, Apple gives Macs that have been off sale for five to seven years “vintage” and eventually “obsolete” status, at which point opportunities for repairs become limited. Software: Software support also plays a crucial role, especially unsupported Macs can be vulnerable to security issues. Apple typically provides macOS updates for Macs up to around eight years old, but that window is narrowing with the company ending support for Intel Macs in the near future. With Apple transitioning fully to its own silicon and phasing out support for Intel models, knowing how long your Mac will receive updates – and when it’s time to upgrade – is more important than ever. Updated February 2026 with details of the macOS Big Sur and Catalina updates and news that a new battery-preservation tool coming in the next update to macOS Tahoe (macOS 26.4) will allow users to cap charging between 80-100% which should extend battery life. Is your Mac too old?
We know that Macs cost a fair bit of money and not everyone has the luxury of upgrading every few years. But at what point is it time to consider upgrading your Mac?
Is the hardware to old? One factor to consider is the age at which most Macs start to experience issues, such as random shutdowns and degraded batteries that no longer hold their charge. Unfortunately, at one point repairing your Mac or MacBook will no longer be a viable option and you will need to look for a replacement. There is a point at which Apple stops providing the required parts for Macs, rating them either obsolete and vintage. Once a Mac is considered vintage (you can find a list of vintage and obsolete Macs below) we would recommend that you upgrade it.
Is the software to old? Another issue with aging Macs is that the software you need may not run on it. You may find that your Mac cannot update to the latest version of macOS (Apple’s Mac operating system software), but it’s even more concerning if Apple is no longer issuing security updates to the version of macOS you can run – because that make you open to malware and security vulnerabilities. We will explain which versions of macOS are supported – and for how much longer, below.
If the following apply, it is probably the case that your Mac has reached the end of its useful life:
Apple no longer supports the latest version of the software it runs (which could leave you vulnerable).
The apps you need to use no longer run on it.
The Mac struggles to perform the tasks you need it to – especially as you can’t update the RAM and other components.
Something breaks and is too expensive to fix, or the parts aren’t available.
The Mac is becoming unreliable. Unexpected shutdowns are becoming commonplace and you’ve tried everything to fix the problem to no avail. Apple Software support: Which Macs are supported by macOS updates – and why it matters…
Only the most recent version of macOS gets feature updates, but Apple usually maintains the last two or three versions of the macOS with bug fixes and important security updates, ensuring that the latest version of Safari will run, and that Apple Services, such as iCloud, are fully supported
Apple currently provides support for these versions of macOS, in terms of security updates:
macOS Tahoe
macOS Sequoia
macOS Sonoma
Since Tahoe arrived on September 15, 2025, Apple has continued to issue security updates for Sequoia and Sonoma. Sonoma’s predecessor, macOS Ventura, last had a security update in August 2025.
On that basis, if your Mac is able to run macOS Tahoe, Sequoia, or Sonoma, you should be able to be confident that Apple will keep an eye on any security vulnerabilities and other problems with these operating systems. You can see which Macs that includes in the next section of this article.
If your Mac is running an older version of the Mac operating system, you will find yourself out in the cold when it comes to essential security updates to Apple’s software. Read: The latest version of macOS your Mac can run. That said, there has been a surprise update to macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina: On February 2 2026, Apple issued a update to fix a FaceTime and Messages Certificate in order to ensure that those communication tools remained operational on the older systems. This doesn’t mean that Apple is offering security updates to those versions of macOS. Another reason why must run a supported macOS version is that if it is too old you may also find that your other Apple products aren’t compatible with your Mac. For example, without the latest security update, you may no longer be able to use Apple Pay or other means to pay for services online, for example. And if you want to sync your iPad or iPhone with your Mac (rather than using iCloud) you will need a recent version of macOS. Since Catalina, syncing is done via the Finder, rather than iTunes. If you can’t run macOS Catalina you will need at least iTunes 12.8.2.3 and at least Mac OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan) or your Mac will not recognize your iPhone or iPad. Are Intel Macs supported by Apple? Apple There are a small number of 2018/2019 Intel-powered Macs currently supported by macOS Tahoe, Sequoia and Sonoma, but support for Intel Macs will be ending soon. Apple has revealed that the version of macOS that launches in September 2026 will not support any Intel Macs. However, that doesn’t mean that support for Intel Macs ends in September 2026. Apple will continue to support macOS Sequoia for at least one more year and macOS Tahoe until 2028, so a small number of Intel Macs should receive support until September 2028. If your Macs isn’t in the list of supported Macs below, it won’t receive important security updates: Which Macs are supported by Apple in 2026
Apple’s support for the Mac lineup is centered on its transition to Apple silicon, with the current operating system, macOS 26 Tahoe, serving as the final time Intel-based machines will receive the latest macOS update.
Apple generally provides full feature updates for the most recent macOS version and security updates for the previous two.
The following versions are actively supported with security patches: macOS 26 Tahoe: The current flagship version, released on September 15, 2025.
macOS 15 Sequoia: Released in 2024.
macOS 14 Sonoma: Released in 2023.
Macs supported by macOS Tahoe macOS Tahoe supports the following Macs, including a small number of Intel-powered models. We expect that Apple will continue to support Tahoe with security updates until fall 2028:
MacBook Air M1 and later
MacBook Pro 16-inch from 2019 and later
MacBook Pro 12-inch from 2018 and later
Mac mini M1 and later
iMac from mid 2020 and later
Mac Pro from 2019 and later
Mac Studio (all models)
Macs supported by macOS Sequoia 2024’s Sequoia supports the following Macs, including a number of Intel-based models. We expect that Apple will continue to support Sequoia with security updates until fall 2027. MacBook Air from 2020 and later
MacBook Pro from 2018 and later
Mac mini from 2018 and later
iMac from 2019 and later

Oldest: 2017 iMac Pro
This means that the oldest Macs supported right now is the 2017 iMac Pro, but only while Apple still supports macOS Sequoia security updates.
The next Macs to lose support will be those that cannot update from macOS Sonoma, for which support will likely end in September 2026. At this time, the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air will lose support.
The 2018 MacBook Pro and Mac mini, and the 2019 iMac should continue to get support until fall 2027 as they can run macOS Sequoia. Which Macs aren’t supported by macOS? macOS Ventura is no longer supported by Apple software updates
Apple Support for 2022’s macOS Ventura has ended now that Apple has released macOS Tahoe.
This means that, aside from the iMac Pro, no Macs from 2017 are supported with security updates. The following Macs can not be updated to macOS Sonoma from macOS Ventura: 2017 MacBook
2017 MacBook Pro
2017 iMac Read: Can my Mac run Ventura?
When Apple introduced Sequoia in 2023 it dropped support for macOS Monterey, meaning that Macs that couldn’t update from Monterey could no longer get security updates.
The following Macs couldn’t update from macOS Monterey to Ventura: iMac 2015
MacBook Air 2017
MacBook Pro 2016
Mac mini 2014 Mac Pro 2013
All other Macs that pre-date those mentioned above are no longer supported by Apple’s software updates.
If your Mac is a decade old then you certainly won’t get security updates for it. In fact, we’d recommend avoiding any Macs from before 2019, in which case you might as well just look at 2020 Macs with Apple’s own processor, rather than Intel, which won’t be supported for much longer. Does it matter if my Mac won’t run a supported macOS?
Once you cannot update your Mac to run a supported version of macOS you are vulnerable to security breaches, which should obviously be a concern. You may also find that you can’t carry out transactions on the internet if you want to pay for things on your out-of-date Mac. It’s also probably that the software you need won’t run on your Mac. Apple and other companies stop supporting older versions of the applications they make, so there could be issues with the versions of the software you are running. If you are experiencing random shutdowns, for example, it could be due to problems with an app you are running – problems that will not be addressed by the developer because that version of the app is no longer supported.
If you want to run fully supported software then you will need to update to a newer version of macOS – and that may mean that you need to update your Mac. Although, there are workarounds to install a new version of macOS on an old Mac if you need to.
Once Apple no longer supports your Macs with operating system updates, it’s probably a good time to replace your Mac. When do Macs become obsolete?
But it’s not just software updates that determine the lifespan of a Mac. It’s also a question of whether it will be possible to fix your Mac should something go wrong with the hardware. Apple has two standards that indicate hardware support is waining: Obsolete or Vintage. The first stage is Vintage: you might be lucky enough to get parts for this Mac, the second is Obsolete: you are out on your own when it comes to any attempt to mend the Mac if it goes wrong. If you look at Apple’s list of Obsolete Macs – those being the Macs that Apple will no longer provide spare parts for – you will see that the company stops providing parts for Macs that it hasn’t sold for more than seven years. In fact, the company may not even provide parts for Macs that haven’t been sold for more than five years (considered Vintage by the company).
This could mean that you won’t be able to get a faulty Mac fixed because the parts aren’t available.
Obsolete Macs
Obsolete Macs are generally Macs that Apple stopped selling more than seven years ago. Once a Mac is in Apple’s obsolete list you have little chance of getting it repaired if something does go wrong. You might be able to find spare parts yourself, but Apple won’t provide them.
You’ll find more details about the exact models on Apple’s US page and the equivalent UK page, but the lists below will give you a general idea.
Apple considers the following Macs and older Obsolete, now including the 2017 MacBook Pro models:
11-inch MacBook Air (early 2015 and older) 12-inch MacBook (2016 and older)
13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015 and older)
13-inch MacBook Pro (2017 and older)
15-inch MacBook Pro (2017 and older)
27-inch iMac (2015 and older)
21.5-inch iMac (2015 and older)
Mac mini (2012 and older) Mac mini Server (2012 and older)
Mac Pro (2010 and older)
Anything predating the Intel switch, obviously. Petter Ahrnstedt Vintage Macs
Apple also has a list of Vintage Macs. These are Macs that Apple stopped selling between five and seven years ago. (If you live in France where a law means you can get support for spare parts for up to seven years after Apple stops selling a Mac).
Apple Authorized Service Providers will repair vintage products, as long as parts are available.
Apple lists the following products as being vintage, now including the 2020 MacBook Air, 2019 MacBook Air, 2019 MacBook Pro and 2019 iMac, and the 2018 Mac mini:
12-inch MacBook (2017)
13-inch MacBook Air (2018, 2019 and 2020)
13-inch MacBook Pro (2017, 2018 &amp; 2019)
15-inch MacBook Pro (2015, 2017, 2018, 2019)
21.5-inch iMac (2013, 2017)
27-inch iMac (2015, 2017 &amp; 2019)
Mac Pro (2012 &amp; 2014)
Mac mini (2014 &amp; 2018)
Based on the above, we’d suggest that if your Mac is more than eight years old, it’s time to look for a new one. And, if you see a 2018 or earlier Mac on sale, it’s not wise to buy it. In fact you will note that there are even 2019 Macs on the vintage list. Read: Why you shouldn’t buy a second hand Mac.
See: Best Mac: Every Apple Mac and MacBook compared How to extend the life of a MacBook Use your MacBook with the screen open for better thermal management. Petter Ahrnstedt Extending the life of your MacBook involves a combination of optimizing software settings, maintaining battery health, and adopting hardware habits that protect the device’s physical integrity.
Battery health: One way to extend the life of a MacBook is to not leave it plugged in all the time. Apple added an Optimize Battery Charging feature in macOS Catalina that uses machine learning to limit charging to help extend battery lifespan by reducing wear from constant full charges. Since the arrival of this feature, users have been asking for the ability to manually set the charge limit below 100 percent. In response, Apple is adding the ability to stop charging between 80-100% in macOS 26.4. Thermal Management: Avoid pushing the machine to the point of overheating. MacBook Pro models feature fans for better cooling during intensive tasks, whereas the fanless MacBook Air may throttle performance to maintain safe temperatures. Using External Displays: If you frequently work at a desk, using your MacBook in “clamshell mode” (with the lid closed) can help organize your space and reduce the footprint on your desk. However, operating the laptop with the lid closed while connected to an external monitor may make it more likely to overheat. Because the MacBook’s chassis and keyboard area often assist in dissipating heat, closing the lid can trap thermal energy that would otherwise escape through the top of the device. This heat buildup is particularly concerning for fanless models like the MacBook Air. Without an internal fan to force air circulation, these models rely entirely on passive cooling, which is less effective when the lid is closed. We recommend using multiple external displays with your Mac, but with the MacBook open to allow for cooling. Security: Ensure you update macOS often and only install applications from the “App Store &amp; Known Developers” to prevent malicious software from compromising your system. Should I fix or upgrade components in my Mac? You may be wondering if spending money to improve your Mac, or fix a hardware problem, might be more savvy than buying a brand new Mac.
If your Mac is in the Obsolete category above and something goes wrong with it then you are going to struggle to get the necessary parts if you wanted to attempt to get it fixed as Apple won’t provide the parts. You might be able to buy an old Mac on eBay or similar and scrap if for the parts, but we’d suggest that it really wouldn’t be worth the effort.
Even if your Mac is in the Vintage list then Apple might be able to provide the required parts, but there is no guarantee. If you are lucky enough to get the part an Apple service provider might even be able to fix the Mac for you – but the cost of the work is likely to be prohibitive.
Similarly, if you are considering adding more RAM, or doubling your storage by adding a new SSD, you will be similarly prohibited because with most modern Macs there is no way to update the hardware.
It’s been years since it was possible to upgrade the RAM in a Mac. Now Apple solders RAM in place and hides components away to make access impossible (or at least impossible if you don’t want to completely destroy your Mac attempting to get to them). With M-series Macs memory, GPU and CPU are all integrated onto the chip, so it is impossible to upgrade them. Nor can you update the SSD as it is soldered onto the motherboard. There are other ways to upgrade your Mac, though. Read: How to upgrade your Mac mini for ideas. Apple repair programs
You might find that the Mac was included in part of a recall due to the issue you are experiencing, in that case, it might be worth enlisting in a repair program. However, if the time period in which Apple was offering the repairs has passed (which is unfortunately likely) then you will still have to find the money for the repair, which again might be prohibitive.
If the Mac you own, or are considering buying would be affected by any of the problems listed below that’s another reason to avoid it. Apple’s current Mac repair programs include:
A recall for 15-inch MacBook Pro units due to a battery fault. September 2015 to February 2017 models affected.
Current service programs: There is a Mac mini service program with a No Power Issue. This relates to the 2023 Mac mini, but specifically devices manufactured between June 16, 2024 to November 23, 2024.
Service programs that have now ended:
There was a keyboard services for some Mac laptops bought since 2016, but this is no longer running.
A 13-inch MacBook Pro backlit service program for models from 2016-2018.
A SSD service program for 13in MacBook Pro models from 2017-2018.
A battery replacement program for 13in MacBook Pros from 2016-2017.
We have more information about Apple’s product recalls and repair programs here. Plus, visit this page for more information on the above repair programs.
Assuming your fault isn’t one of those listed above, you may be faced with a pricy repair bill. We suggest that if your Mac is older than five years then repairing it will not be worth it – unless of course there are important documents or photos on it that you want to retrieve in which case it might be worth looking at how to recover these files or the best software to recover data on your Mac. How long do Macs last?
So, in answer to the question: How long do Macs last? We’d say five to eight years, but beware that you may not be able to replace any faulty parts in a Mac when more than five years have passed since Apple last sold it.
With Apple saying that it will stop support for Intel-powered Macs with the version of macOS that launches at the end of 2026, we recommend that you avoid buying an Intel-powered Mac now.
So, our advice right now is to avoid buying a Mac that is more than five years old – especially if it has Intel inside. And if you haven’t yet updated to the series Apple silicon powered Macs, what are you waiting for!

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld The iPad mini isn’t on the same update cadence as Apple’s other tablets. Where the iPad and iPad Air generally get annual refreshes, and the iPad Pro gets a new model every 18 months, the iPad mini can often go years without an update. As such, the current iPad mini, which was released in October 2024, isn’t expected to get an update until later this year. But it could be worth the wait.
2026 iPad mini: At a glance
A18 Pro, N1, C1X
Possible OLED display
Same design and cameras
Same price 2026 iPad mini: Performance and specs A18 Pro chip
8GB RAM
C1X modem
N1 chip for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6
Since it hasn’t been updated in over a year, the 2026 iPad mini will likely get several chip upgrades. With the current iPad mini sporting an A17 Pro with 8GB of RAM and Apple Intelligence support, the 2026 iPad mini is expected to jump to the A18 Pro, according to reports.
The A18 Pro has the same number of CPU cores as the A17 Pro (10), but the chip optimizations make the A18 Pro a faster CPU performer. The A18 Pro is available with a 6-core GPU, which is one more GPU core than the A17 Pro. So it’ll benchmark a little better than the existing model but won’t bring a huge speed bump.
With the iPhone 17 lineup, Apple released a new N1 chip for wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread). Apple is expected to gradually roll out the new chip to the iPad line throughout 2026 and 2027, including the iPad mini. We also expect the cellular version of the iPad mini to get Apple’s C1X modem. The A18 Pro chip will be the main new feature in the upcoming iPad mini Apple 2026 iPad mini: Design and display
OLED display upgrade
Similar design
The new iPad mini has had the same design since its 2021 overhaul, and the 2026 model is expected to keep the same overall look. There’s a strong possibility of new colors, however. Apple currently offers blue, purple, starlight, and space gray, following the previous model’s pink, purple, starlight, and space gray.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The US Supreme Court has declared on Friday that most of the import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration last year were illegal. Trump’s response to this now leaves Apple in a worse position than it was in before.
While lobbying by Apple had resulted in almost all of its products being excluded from the previous tariffs, Trump has announced new ones which will include them again …

      <title><![CDATA[How cheap is a cheap MacBook, really?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3064445/how-cheap-is-a-cheap-macbook-really.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld There’s probably not long to go now. Based on Apple’s looming “global experience” on March 4, dwindling stock of the M1 MacBook Air, and a near-universal consensus among pundits and leakers, the much-anticipated cheap MacBook will be with us in the next week or two. But we still don’t know the answer to the key question.
Exactly how cheap are we talking about?
Because here’s the thing: As a general rule, Apple doesn’t do cheap. It prefers to focus on the premium end of the market where the margins are higher, and it can get more mileage out of its luxury brand. Conversely, dabbling in the budget market risks tarnishing that brand: if everyone can afford an iPhone, owning an iPhone stops being a status symbol.
From the iPhone 5c and Apple Watch SE to the AirPods 4 and Mac mini, fans have often got excited about the imminent launch of a “cheap” Apple product, then been disappointed when it turns out to sit roughly on the border of budget and solidly affordable mid-market. They’re (mostly) good products perfectly capable of delivering value for money. But that isn’t quite the same as being out-and-out cheap.
Indeed, despite rising costs of living in the U.S. and several major international markets, Apple appears less inclined than ever to cater to buyers on a strict budget. This time last year, it released the iPhone 16e, which was certainly more affordable than its siblings but cost $170 more than the iPhone SE it nominally replaced. The new “e” phone felt like a signal that Apple no longer wished to participate (or pretend to participate) in the budget smartphone market. And the iPhone 17e, which we expect to launch in a matter of days as well, is unlikely to reverse that decision.
So what would be a reasonable asking price for a MacBook with an A19 iPhone chip? For comparison purposes, let’s consider the rest of Apple’s current range. At the top, the MacBook Pro starts at $1,599 for the 14-inch model with an M5 chip, while the MacBook Air starts at $999 for the 13-inch model with an M4 chip. Even if the cheap MacBook has the same 256GB of storage and 16GB of RAM as those models (which isn’t guaranteed), it’ll cost less than both of those, so we can start subtracting from a thousand.
At the other end, the most interesting comparator is the M1 MacBook Air. Apple once sold this machine for $999 long past its prime, and it continued to be sold by Walmart until very recently. In 2024, Walmart sold the M1 Air for $699, but the price fell over the months to $599, $549 and finally all the way down to $499 on Cyber Monday last year, so this gives us a floor.
Now that we’ve established that cheap is between $499 and $999, let’s drill down deeper. The budget MacBook will be targeted at customers who need to do light work on the go, and that’s veering into iPad territory. The entry-level and mini versions of the iPad don’t quite fit that target audience, but the iPad Air is about right. That starts at $599. Chuck in the Magic Keyboard, and we’re up to $868. I’d expect our MacBook’s price tag to sit somewhere between those two numbers, hopefully closer to the lower end.
And this is more or less where pundits have ended up. Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg, says the budget MacBook will cost “well under $1,000.” Others have more ambitiously claimed it could start as low as $599 to compete in the popular Chromebook market, and maybe Apple will manage this by making heavy compromises on the specs and feature set. But I’d be surprised by that, given how recently Apple fans were expected to part with the same amount for a five-year-old MacBook Air. Based on our experience with the transition from the iPhone SE 3 to the iPhone S16e, I’d expect the A19 Pro MacBook to cost somewhere between $699 and $799, with a discount of $50 or $100 for education buyers.
Of course, there are plenty of customers out there who’d be delighted if Apple went lower. Our colleagues at PCWorld have an entire article recommending laptops under $500, and this includes one pick under $300 and another under $200. If Apple truly wanted to smash the ultra-budget Chromebook market, it would be targeting numbers like that. But it won’t. And the sooner we accept this, the better. Foundry Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup.

Par exemple, Widelands, un jeu open source de stratégie en temps réel, a annoncé le 24 février le blocage des contenus générés par une IA, un agent ou tout autre outil d’IA. "L'équipe de développement de Widelands rédige une résolution visant à refuser les contributions de contenu généré par l'IA (code, graphismes, musique, etc.) au code source et aux dépôts du jeu. Nous estimons que le contenu généré par l'IA est généralement problématique sur les plans éthique et juridique, car il viole les droits d'auteur des créateurs dont les œuvres ont été utilisées pour l'entraînement de l'IA sans leur autorisation et sans mention de leur nom. De plus, nous constatons qu'il est souvent de faible qualité et/ou trop générique, et qu'il ne répond pas aux exigences spécifiques de Widelands. Les demandes de fusion générées par l'IA pourront être fermées sans examen. Widelands est créé par des humains, pour des humains."
Le projet fixe donc des limites sur ce qui est autorisé ou non. Ainsi, les extensions et la documentation sont exclues de cette résolution anti-IA.
L’Electronic Frontier Foundation n'est pas opposée au code généré ni à l'IA en général, mais la fondation veut des règles claires et fixer des limites. Ainsi, dans ses nouvelles politiques, les contributions générées par une IA (au sens global du terme) doivent respecter plusieurs principes : Veuillez vous abstenir de soumettre des contributions que vous n’avez pas parfaitement comprises, examinées et testées. Veuillez indiquer si votre contribution a été générée par une IA. Les descriptions et doivent être rédigés par vos soins. Les responsables du projet peuvent déterminer si les contributions ne sont pas raisonnablement examinables. Il est intéressant de noter qu'ici, l'EFF veut imposer de bonnes pratiques. Le développeur doit comprendre le code généré et ne pas lui faire une confiance absolue, ni le soumettre sans aucune revue. Pour obliger le développeur à lire le code généré, l'EFF veut que les soient rédigés par le développeur lui-même.
Le moteur Godot est dans la même situation et avertit que les PR déposées sont de plus en plus générées par une IA et, à force, cela épuise les mainteneurs. L'alerte est venue de Rémi Verschelde. Un autre développeur, Adriaan, va plus loin et critique même le sens de nombreuses requêtes : "Le dépôt GitHub de Godot est saturé de demandes de fusion générées par des développeurs débutants, ce qui représente une perte de temps considérable pour les relecteurs – surtout si cela n'est pas signalé. Les modifications sont souvent incompréhensibles, les descriptions sont excessivement verbeuses et les utilisateurs eux-mêmes ne comprennent pas leurs propres modifications… C'est un véritable désastre."
Dans la communauté Blender, le problème est identique et une réglementation sur les contributions IA est discutée :
"On observe une augmentation des demandes de fusion générées par l'IA, sans que cela soit clairement indiqué, et dont l'auteur ne comprend pas toujours pleinement la contribution. La revue de code et la maintenance ont toujours constitué un goulot d'étranglement majeur. Lorsque les contributions de l'IA ne sont pas entièrement comprises par le contributeur lui-même, la charge de travail des relecteurs s'en trouve encore alourdie. Dans le pire des cas, les relecteurs communiquent avec l'IA par un jeu du téléphone arabe.
Il est important de former les nouveaux développeurs pour faire évoluer le projet, même lorsqu'il aurait été plus rapide pour le relecteur d'effectuer lui-même les modifications (avec ou sans IA). C'est pourquoi les relecteurs devraient savoir s'ils collaborent avec un humain, afin de pouvoir décider du moment opportun pour fournir cet effort.
Par ailleurs, la revue de code assistée par l'IA et les vérifications basées sur nos directives peuvent potentiellement alléger la charge de travail des relecteurs, contribuer à la correction des bogues et à l'amélioration de la stabilité."
Le projet open source Coolify dit exactement la même chose : trop de PR de mauvaise qualité ou incompréhensibles. Le mainteneur a mis en place une GitHub Action pour détecter une PR trop mauvaise ou générée par une IA. Résultat : 98 % des PR pourraient être fermées automatiquement...
Notre : trop d'IA tue l'IA ? Pas exactement, mais on constate depuis quelques semaines une volonté croissante de projets open source d'agir pour préserver la qualité du code et surtout éviter les requêtes inutiles générées par une IA, sans que la personne comprenne réellement le sens de la demande ni le code soumis. Et c'est là le véritable problème. L'objectif n'est pas de bannir l'IA, mais d'encadrer son usage et de responsabiliser les développeurs. Catégorie actualité: IA Godot, IA Image actualité AMP:]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[One of the core Apple Intelligence features to date has been Visual Intelligence. It started off in a rather limited capacity through Camera Control, but with iOS 26, the company expanded it to screenshots. I’ve found those capabilities very useful thus far, and I’d love to see Apple take it even further.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3023806/apple-mac-features-oled-budget-touchscreen-5g.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld According to rumors, 2026 is shaping up to be a huge year for the Mac, starting in just a couple of weeks with Apple’s first event (or “experience”) of the year. Along with the usual faster chips, Apple reportedly has new tricks up its sleeve in 2026, with several new features that will have Mac users everywhere saying, “Finally!” Here are four major overdue announcements we expect to arrive this year.
A budget MacBook
iPhone fans have long pined for a truly affordable MacBook priced below the $999 MacBook Air that isn’t just an older model with a cut-rate price. That dream machine may finally arrive in just two short weeks. On March 4, Apple will hold a series of “experiences” in New York, London, and Shanghai, and the star is expected to be the first-ever low-cost MacBook. After tackling the mid-range market with the MacBook Air, Apple reportedly wants to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops, with a new laptop that could be as cheap as $599. Apple will reportedly use an A18 Pro or A19 Pro iPhone chip, and it will likely have a smaller screen than the Air and possibly fewer USB ports. But it will be powerful enough for everyday tasks and light work. For a lot of users, that’s all that’s needed.
MacBooks with OLED displays]]></description>

      <link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Hawaii-Macs-AMDGPU-DC-Fix</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Timur Kristóf of Valve's open-source Linux graphics driver team has been doing a fantastic job enhancing the older AMD Radeon GPU support under Linux. Last year he made enough improvements to the AMDGPU open-source driver that older Radeon GCN 1.0/1.1 dGPUs switched over to AMDGPU by default for nice performance gains, RADV Vulkan driver support out of the box, and all around better experience than using the legacy Radeon driver. He's also been fixing countless bugs affecting older AMD GPUs. There is another improvement on the way for benefiting some with aging AMD GPUs...]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Nouvelles de Haiku - Hiver 2025-26]]></title>
      <link>https://linuxfr.org/news/nouvelles-de-haiku-hiver-2025-26</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Haiku est un système d’exploitation pensé pour les ordinateurs de bureau. Il est basé sur BeOS mais propose aujourd’hui une implémentation modernisée, performante, et qui conserve les idées qui rendaient BeOS intéressant: une interface intuitive mais permettant une utilisation avancée, une API unifiée et cohérente, et une priorisation de l’interface graphique par rapport à la ligne de commande pour l’administration du système.
Il ne s’agit pas d’une distribution Linux, mais d’un système complet avec son propre noyau, sa propre pile graphique, etc. L’idée de cette approche est d’avoir une seule équipe travaillant sur toute la pile logicielle, pour éviter les soucis de coordination entre projets indépendant et d’excès de modularité, qui peuvent aboutir à une architecture logicielle inefficace. En revanche, cela demande un gros travail pour une équipe relativement réduite, et le système est donc en développement depuis bientôt un quart de siècle sans avoir encore publié une version majeure complète.
La cinquième version beta a été publiée en 2024. Les développements continuent pour stabiliser, optimiser et peaufiner le système, avec une version beta 6 prévue en début de cette année, qui sera probablement suivie par une beta 7 quelque temps plus tard.
Cette série de dépêches est basée sur les rapports d’activité publiés mensuellement par le projet Haiku. Cette édition couvre les modifications de Haiku numérotées entre hrev59111 et hrev59355 (soit 244 changements individuels), en plus d’activités se déroulant hors du dépôt Git principal.
Entre parenthèses est indiqué le pseudonyme de l’auteur ou autrice principal·e du changement. Des pseudonymes sont utilisés par habitude (venant des canaux IRC et/ou de la culture de la demoscene) et aussi pour préserver l’identité des personnes qui le souhaitent (certains participants utilisent également leur nom légal, d’autres pas). lien nᵒ 1 : Dépêche trimestrielle précédente

Mise à jour de haiku-format
À quand la beta 6?
Mise à jour de Go en version 1.18
Le mois de novembre a vu l’arrivée d’une grosse mise à jour de la chaîne d’outils pour le langage Go en version 1.18. Il s’agit d’une version de 2022, mais c’est un gros progrès puisque la version précédente disponible pour Haiku était la version 1.4 datant de 2014. De plus, cette version 1.18 est disponible dans le dépôt de paquets et peut être installée normalement avec pkgman (au moins pour les architectures x86 et x86_64).
La plus grande partie du travail a été réalisée par Korli, depuis plusieurs années, pour mettre en place l’environnement de compilation nécessaire, et aussi corriger de nombreux problèmes de compatibilité POSIX dans Haiku qui ont été mis en évidence par les tests de Go.
Cela permet par exemple d’utiliser Hugo, le générateur de site statique utilisé pour le site principal de Haiku. Waddlesplash a donc pu rédiger et vérifier le rapport d’activité de novembre en utilisant uniquement Haiku : avec Hugo, WebPositive (le navigateur natif de Haiku, basé sur WebKit), l’éditeur de texte Koder, ainsi que Iceweasel (un portage de Firefox) pour la correction d’orthographe.
Redémarrage automatique de app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique de Haiku. Il s’agit d’un composant critique, pour lequel un crash rend le système à peu près inutilisable. Waddlesplash a corrigé plusieurs problèmes dans le code pour permettre de redémarrer le serveur après un crash, et de le reconnecter avec les applications en cours d’exécution. Ce redémarrage nécessite encore quelques étapes manuelles car les crash démarrent actuellement le debugger automatiquement, mais cela peut être changé par une simple configuration.
Applications
ActivityMonitor
ActivityMonitor affiche sous forme graphique divers paramètres du système: charge CPU, consommation mémoire… Il peut s’exécuter dans une fenêtre ou bien être intégré au bureau sous forme d’un « réplicant ».
Affichage d’un message « pas de capteurs de température » à la place du graphe de température du système si l’information n’est pas disponible (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème de localisation, certains fichiers sources n’étaient pas pris en compte et les chaînes contenues dedans ne pouvaient pas être traduites (humdinger).
Terminal
Le Terminal permet d’exécuter des applications en ligne de commande.
Synchronisation du presse-papier interne du Terminal avec celui du système seulement une fois au démarrage de l’application, et pas lors du changement d’onglet comme cela avait été implémenté au trimestre précédent (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème qui masquait le signal SIGUSR1 pour les shells et autres processus lancés dans le terminal (korli).
Implémentation des séquences d’échappement permettant aux applications CLI de définir des liens hypertextes (en complément des liens qui étaient déjà détectés automatiquement par le terminal en fonction du contenu du texte) (korli).
HaikuDepot
HaikuDepot est l’interface graphique du gestionnaire de paquets. Il utilise un backend en ligne en Java pour stocker et récupérer les captures d’écrans, et notes d’utilisateurs, icônes des paquets, liste de paquets mis en avant, et d’autres informations.
L’application est plus robuste en cas de problème de réseau : gestion des erreurs et affichage de messages clairs pour l’utilisateur. Gestion en particulier des erreurs 503 remontées par l’API web utilisée par HaikuDepot (apl).
Ajout de filtres pour trouver facilement les applications « natives » (n’utilisant pas Qt ou GTK) et d’un filtre « desktop » pour trouver les applications graphiques (et filtrer un très grand nombre de paquets de bibliothèques, applications en ligne de commande…) (apl, avec des améliorations par humdinger pour clarifier la terminologie).
Amélioration de la taille de la fenêtre des conditions d’utilisation sur les écrans haute densité (nipos).
Refonte de la gestion des identifiants de messages internes à l’application HaikuDepot pour en simplifier la maintenance (apl).
Interdiction de la sélection multiple dans la liste des paquets (apl).
WebPositive
WebPositive est le navigateur web fourni avec Haiku. Il est basé sur le moteur WebKit, co-développé avec Apple, Sony, Igalia et d’autres participants.
Modification du message envoyé au Tracker pour ouvrir le dossier contenant un fichier (par exemple un téléchargement), pour utiliser le message officiellement prévu à cet effet plutôt qu’un moyen détourné (humdinger).
Meilleure gestion des noms de fichiers longs dans la fenêtre de téléchargements avec l’ajout d’une barre de défilement horizontal (mull, avec un petit correctif par humdinger pour corriger un décalage d’un pixel du positionnement de la barre de défilement).
Un chantier est en cours pour réintégrer à nouveau le portage de WebKit pour Haiku dans les sources upstream. Cela avait déjà été fait en 2010, mais n’avait pas été maintenu par la suite, ce qui a conduit à retirer ce code. Depuis, Haiku utilise un fork resynchronisé régulièrement, mais cela génère du travail en plus. L’envoi du code est aussi l’occasion de faire relire toutes les modifications par les autres développeurs de WebKit, avec des conseils pour améliorer et simplifier l’architecture.
Expander
Expander est une application permettant de décompresser des archives.
Correction d’un décalage d’un pixel de la barre de défilement (humdinger).
AboutSystem
AboutSystem affiche quelques informations sur le système et surtout la liste des auteurs de Haiku.
Simplification du code pour la mise à jour automatique des couleurs, mise en place de la mise à jour automatique des couleurs pour la liste des crédits (si on passe en mode sombre par exemple) (jscipione).
Ouverture de la fenêtre avec une taille respectant les proportions du nombre d’or, esthétiquement plus plaisant (axeld).
LaunchBox
LaunchBox est un « dock » permettant de stocker des raccourcis vers des applications ou fichiers fréquemment utilisés.
Correction de la couleur du panneau de LaunchBox, et d’autres couleurs dans le sélectionneur de couleurs standard (nephele).
Tracker
Tracker est l’explorateur de fichiers. Le code du Tracker contient également les fenêtres « ouvrir » et « enregistrer sous », mises à disposition des autres applications sous forme de la bibliothèque libtracker.so.
Envoi de la notification d’activation de l’espace de travail à tous les réplicants, afin que ces derniers puissent ajuster leur couleur (par exemple) en fonction de l’espace de travail actif (jscipione).
Correction du positionnement du champ de texte lors du renommage de fichiers dans la vue par icônes, résolution de problèmes de gestion de l’état des fenêtres après un glisser-déposer avorté, affichage des volumes disque en premier (avant les dossiers) si l’option « trier les dossiers en premier » est active, synchronisation en direct des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers lors du changement d’options, et divers nettoyages de code (jscipione).
Ajout d’une bordure manquante dans les fenêtres de sélection de fichiers (nipos).
Ajout du nombre d’élément sélectionnés (en plus du nombre d’éléments total du dossier) dans les fenêtres du Tracker (nathan242).
Correction d’un problème de concurrence dans le constructeur des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers, dont la conséquence était une mauvaise disposition des contrôles dans la fenêtre (certains boutons apparaissant superposés par exemple (PulkoMandy).
Amélioration de l’image d’aperçu qui suit la souris lors d’un glisser-déplacer lorsqu’on déplace beaucoup de fichiers: l’image est tronquée pour ne pas être trop grande mais le dégradé de transparence sur les bords n’était pas bien calculé (PulkoMandy).
Déclenchement automatique du « renifleur » de type MIME, qui identifie automatiquement les fichiers pour les afficher avec la bonne icône par exemple. En particulier cela rend l’utilisation du Tracker plus confortable sur les systèmes de fichiers ne permettant pas de stocker le type MIME dans un attribut étendu (Jim906).
Correction d’une régression sur la mise à jour en direct des tailles et dates de modification de fichiers dans les résultats de requêtes (waddlesplash).
MediaPlayer
MediaPlayer est une application pour lire des fichiers média (son et vidéo).
Correction de la couleur du texte dans la fenêtre d’informations (nephele).
Dans cette même fenêtre, le champ indiquant le chemin du fichier en cours de lecture est maintenant cliquable (nathan242, dont c’est la première contribution).
Ajout d’une détection automatique du type MIME des fichiers, s’il n’est pas renseigné (par exemple s’il est stocké sur un système de fichiers où il n’y a pas d’attributs étendus) (DigitalBox98).
Sudoku
Sudoku est un jeu de Sudoku, très utile pour patienter pendant une compilation un peu longue.
Amélioration de la palette de couleurs en mode clair (le mode sombre nécessite encore du travail) (axeld).
DeskBar
DeskBar est la barre des tâches de BeOS et de Haiku. La même application contient également le code pour la fenêtre de changement de tâches « Twitcher ».
Correction d’un bug qui faisait apparaître des applications en double dans le « Twitcher » (la fenêtre de changement rapide d’application qui apparaît avec le raccourci Alt+Tab) (madmax).
People
People est un gestionnaire de contacts. Il stocke les contacts dans des fichiers « person » avec les informations sous forme d’attributs étendus.
Correction du défilement avec la molette de la souris ou au touchpad (nipos).
Lecteur MIDI
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
MidiPlayer
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
Changement de la couleur du contrôle de volume qui était codée en dur, non configurable et pas harmonisée avec le reste du système (nipos).
ProcessController
ProcessController affiche la charge CPU et l’occupation mémoire dans la DeskBar. Il permet également d’afficher des statistiques par application, et de débugger et stopper des applications via un menu popup.
Ajustements pour les écrans haute densité : taille des menus, largeur par défaut de l’icône réplicant, autorisation du redimensionnement de la fenêtre principale (la taille est conservée si on installe ensuite un réplicant sur le bureau, et divers autres changements (waddlesplash).
Installer
Installer permet de cloner l’installation de Haiku actuelle vers un autre disque.
Ajout d’un outil pour copier automatiquement le chargeur de démarrage sur la partition EFI du système, pour réduire le nombre d’étapes manuelles pour installer Haiku correctement sur un système EFI (PawanYr, avec des améliorations de kallisti5 pour nommer le fichier installé correctement en fonction de l’architecture CPU du système).
Amélioration du calcul de la taille de la fenêtre « EULA » de l’installeur (qui affiche non pas un contrat de license, mais un message de bienvenue et quelques instructions pour l’installation), en fonction de la taille de texte sélectionnée dans les préférences (nipos).
Mail
L'application Mail permet de lire et de rédiger des e-mail. Elle fonctionne en collaboration avec le mail_server qui s’occupe de l’envoi et de la réception des messages.
Correction d’une régression sur la couleur de fond des champs d’adresse. Mise en place des mises à jour de couleurs automatiques. Les champs désactivés ou en lecture seule sont maintenant « navigables » (avec la touche tab) et le texte peut être sélectionné et copié (jscipione).
Les boutons « suivant » et « précédent » peuvent être accompagnés de la touche Maj. (Shift), pour changer de message sans modifier le statut « lu » des messages (humdinger).
DriveSetup
DriveSetup permet de configurer les supports de stockage: formatage, partitionnement.
L’application s’affiche sur tous les espaces de travail si la DeskBar n’est pas lancée. Ce cas particulier est utile lors du lancement de l’installation de Haiku, dans ce cas, le bureau n’est pas lancé, mais il est tout de même possible d’utiliser plusieurs espaces de travail, ce qui peut donner l’impression que les fenêtres ont disparu si on se retrouve sur un espace vide (PulkoMandy).
Finalisation d’un patch datant d’il y a plusieurs années pour ajouter un menu permettant d’écrire ou de lire des images disques depuis ou vers des partitions (plus besoin d’utiliser dd en ligne de commande) (sed4096, avec l’aide d’humdinger pour des améliorations de localisation et de choix de vocabulaire).
Debugger
Debugger permet de débugger les logiciels fonctionnant dans Haiku.
Correction d’un crash lorsqu’on essaie de débugger des applications trop grosses, par exemples celle utilisant Mesa et llvmpipe pour faire du rendu 3D (waddlesplash).
Changements transverses
Modification de toutes les chaînes de caractères où le nom d’une application est présent (par exemple : « Deskbar preferences »). En effet, le nom des applications peut optionnellement être traduit, et toutes ces chaînes doivent donc s’adapter dans les deux cas (nom d’application traduit ou conservé en anglais selon les préférences de l’utilisateur). Auparavant ce réglage ne pouvait pas être appliqué de façon systématique (humdinger).
Fenêtres de préférences
Réseau
Affichage de l’état précis des interfaces réseau (en cours de configuration DHCP, par exemple) et pas seulement « hors ligne » ou « en ligne » (nipos).
Périphériques d’entrée
Ajout et amélioration de plusieurs options pour la gestion des touchpad (samuelrp84). Voir plus bas les informations sur la réécriture du pilote Elantech qui donne plus de détails.
Apparence
Envoi d’un seul message de mise à jour aux applications lorsque plusieurs couleurs changent simultanément, ce qui est plus efficace et réduit les « clignotements » d’applications dans certains cas (nephele).
Correction de la hauteur des fausses barres de défilement visibles dans la fenêtre d’apparence pour configurer les barres de défilement (jscipione).
Outils en ligne de commande
Le réplicant NetworkStatus peut être installé dans la DeskBar via la ligne de commande même lorsque une fenêtre de NetworkStatus est déjà ouverte (nipos).
Ajout dans strace de l’affichage des structures stat, sockopt, sigset_t, sigprocmask et des noms de signaux (korli avec un correctif par nathan242).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans l’interface en ligne de commande du Debugger, qui conduisaient entre autres à un gel de l’application. Cette interface est surtout utilisée en cas de crash d’un service critique (app_server, registrar, input_server) qui empêcherait l’utilisation de l’interface graphique. Les investigations sur ces services en cas de crash sont donc facilitées.
Modification de bfs_tools pour rendre ces outils compilables sur le système hôte utilisé pour compiler Haiku (axeld). Ces outils permettent de manipuler à la main un système de fichiers bfs, de récupérer certaines données sur un disque corrompu, et diverses manipulations de bas niveau.
Modification de l’outil makebootable pour vérifier que la partition à rendre bootable est bien une partition BFS. Utiliser l’outil sur une partition d’un autre format ou sur un disque complet pourrait corrompre le système de fichier et rendre les données inaccessibles. Ajout d’un message indiquant lorsque le lancement de makebootable n’est pas nécessaire, car les utilisateurs continuent de recommander de lancer cet outil sans aucune raison pour corriger des problèmes de démarrage (encourageant ainsi les nouveaux utilisateurs à faire dea mauvaises manipulations et à corrompre leur système de fichiers) (PulkoMandy).
Suppression d’une verrue dans checkfs qui n’est plus nécessaire suite à des améliorations du Storage Kit. Cela permet de lancer checkfs pour vérifier une partition en donnant le chemin de n’importe quel fichier contenu dans la partition (waddlesplash).
Activation du support de l’IPv6 dans telnet, implémentation dans netstat (avec des corrections sur les opérateurs de filtrage), et ajout de traceroute6 compilé à partir des sources fournies par NetBSD (cmeerw).
Amélioration de l’affichage de df avec plus d’informations, un listage sur deux lignes, et l’ajout d’une option pour afficher les informations standardisées dans le format imposé par POSIX (nipos et PulkoMandy).
Kits
Interface
L'interface kit se charge de tout l’affichage de fenêtres à l’écran et des contrôles de base (boutons, cases à cocher…)
Correction d’un bug dans le contrôle calendrier lors du déplacement vers les mois suivant ou précédent (nipos).
Correction d’un problème de navigation au clavier dans une ListView après l’insertion de nouveaux objets (nipos).
BControl (la classe parente de tous les contrôles d’interface graphique) ne change plus ses couleurs dans la fonction AttachedToWindow(). Ce n’est plus nécessaire après d’autres changements dans BButton, et cela simplifie le code nécessaire pour personnaliser la couleur d’un contrôle spécifique (pour avoir, par exemple, un bouton rouge) (jscipione).
Améliorations sur BSlider: correction de la couleur du texte, nettoyage du code de dessin des sliders dans les implémentations de ControlLook (jscipione).
Augmentation de la taille des marques sur les boutons des barres de défilement (marques qui ne sont pas activées à moins de modifier manuellement un fichier de configuration) pour les rendre plus visibles sur les hautes résolutions (jscipione).
Les infobulles utilisent un espacement calculé en fonction de la taille du texte, pour une apparence plus jolie sur les écrans à haute densité (waddlesplash).
Séparation du titre des onglets et du nom des vues qui leurs sont attachées. Le comportement original est hérité de BeOS, il est donc préservé pour les anciennes applications. Mais pour les nouvelles applications, le nom interne des vues ne doit pas être traduit (il peut être utilisé par des scripts ou par le code de l’application), tandis que le titre affiché à l’utilisateur doit l’être. C’était le seul endroit où ce principe de séparation du nom et du texte affiché n’était pas respecté (KapiX et PulkoMandy).
Dans BTextView, la fonction « tout sélectionner » déplace le curseur à la fin de la sélection (et à la fin du texte). C’est le comportement de la plupart des autres systèmes, et préserver la position du curseur dans ce cas ne semble pas particulièrement utile (OscarL).
Correction de problèmes de choix de couleurs dans le code qui dessine des sliders avec un curseur triangulaire (nipos). Cette correction a permis d’utiliser ce type de slider dans les fenêtres de réglages de différents traducteurs d’images.
Amélioration de l’apparence des cases à cocher partiellement cochées. Elles s’affichent avec un signe "-" au lieu d’une croix. Auparavant, la couleur était subtilement modifiée mais ce n’était pas très visible (PulkoMandy).
Implémentation de la lecture d’un son dans BAlert, qui peut être activé dans les préférences de son (sed4096).
Storage
Le storage kit permet de contrôler les disques et supports de stockage (liste des partitions, montage et démontage, accès aux fichiers, chemins d’accès, requêtes…)
BPartition retourne une erreur B_BUSY si on essaie de monter une partition qui est déjà montée à un autre endroit, au lieu de la monter une deuxième fois (jscipione).
Device
Le device kit permet l’interaction directe avec certains périphériques (USB, série, joysticks…) directement depuis l’espace utilisateur.
Correction de problèmes de gestion de la mémoire dans BUSBInterface mis en évidence par AtomoZero lors d’expérimentations pour corriger le pilote de webcam à l’aide d’un LLM (waddlesplash).
Package
Le package kit se charge de la résolution des dépendances entre paquets et du téléchargement des paquets à installer. Il fonctionne en collaboration avec le système de fichier packagefs qui permet d’accéder au contenu des paquets une fois installés.
Retravail de BRepositoryCache pour remonter les informations sur les paquets via un callback plutôt que de remplir une structure BPackageInfoSet. Cela économise beaucoup de mémoire et d’allocations mémoire, et rend donc la lecture des dépôts de paquets plus rapide (waddlesplash).
Serveurs
Notifications
Le serveur de notifications permet d’afficher des notifications pour les évènements importants.
Les notifications déjà affichées changent de position immédiatement lorsque la configuration est modifiée pour les déplacer (nipos).
Ajout de la lecture de l’effet sonore choisi dans les préférences de son lors de l’apparition des différents types de notification, et à chaque pourcent de progression pour les notifications contenant une barre de progression (sed4096).
Choix de couleurs plus visibles en mode sombre pour les icônes de fermeture et de repli des notifications en mode sombre (nipos).
Network
Le serveur de réseau se charge de la configuration des interfaces réseau, de la configuration des routes et d’autres aspects liés à la communication en réseau.
Refonte du client DHCP dans net_server pour l’exécuter dans un thread séparé et ne pas bloquer la boucle de messages principale. Cela corrige plusieurs cas de gel du serveur lui-même et d’application qui communiquent avec de façon synchrone, par exemple les préférences de réseau. Cela permet également de plus facilement arrêter les requêtes DHCP lorsqu’une interface est reconfigurée avec une adresse statique (waddlesplash).
app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique gérant l’affichage à l’écran.
Correction de crashs causés par des verrous de concurrence manquants et des opérations effectuées dans le mauvais ordre (waddlesplash).
Retrait d’identifiants de messages qui n’étaient plus utilisés dans le protocole de communication entre les applications et le serveur graphique (X512).
Ajout du code nécessaire pour le tracé de lignes avec un dégradé de couleur (dans app_server et dans BView). Auparavant, les dégradés étaient utilisables uniquement pour le remplissage des formes et pas pour les contours (x512).
Modifications de BPicturePlayer pour utiliser une classe C++ avec de l’héritage plutôt qu’une structure C contenant des pointeurs de fonctions. Cela permet de vérifier que l’interface est implémentée correctement par les différents utilisateurs de cette classe dès la compilation (X512).
Implémentation de méthodes manquantes dans BoundingBox player, une implémentation de BPicturePlayer qui calcule un rectangle assez grand pour contenir tout le dessin réalisé par un objet BPicture rejoué via BPicturePlayer (KapiX).
Retrait d’une optimisation incorrecte dans le traitement des calques avec une opacité globale de 100% dans app_server. Ces calques peuvent tout de même contenir des pixels avec de la transparence, et doivent donc être applatis en tenant compte du canal alpha comme tous les autres calques (KapiX).
Modification du protocole app_server pour l’opération permettant de récupérer les « bounding boxes » pour chaque caractère d’une chaîne. L’interface précédente utilisait un tableau de structures, la nouvelle API est inversée ce qui permet d’envoyer plus efficacement 2 tableaux de types primitifs (X512).
Pilotes de périphériques
Implémentation correcte des timeouts sur les commandes dans le pilote SDHCI, ce qui corrige la compatibilité avec plusieurs lecteurs de cartes SD (PulkoMandy).
Réécriture complète du pilote pour les touchpads Elantech. Cette série de changements retouche tout d’abord la gestion des touchpads en général, avec des améliorations sur la documentation, sur le traitement des données invalides, la configuration par défaut, et un nettoyage du code.
Ensuite, le code pour la reconnaissance de « gestures » a été amélioré pour mieux reconnaître plusieurs mouvements tels que le « tap » pour cliquer, le défilement en faisant glsser 2 doigts sur le touchpad, etc. Les préférences du touchpad ont reçu plusieurs nouvelles cases à cocher pour configurer ces différentes options.
Enfin, la dernière partie du patch met à jour le pilote Elantech pour reconnaître les 4 versions du protocole, dont la dernière est entièrement testée. La version 2 ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant (elle a été désactivée pour l’instant) et les versions 1 et 3 sont activées de façon expérimentale dans les nightly builds en attendant les retours d’utilisateurs (samuelrp84).
Normalisation des noms de volumes générés par le pilote usb_disk pour s’assurer qu’ils ne commencent pas par des espaces (madmax).
Mise à jour de la couche de compatibilité FreeBSD avec FreeBSD 15 et synchronisation de tous les pilotes réseau (ethernet et wifi) concernés avec ceux de FreeBSD 15. Synchronisation du pilote rtl8125 avec OpenBSD (waddlesplash).
Ajout de « quirks » et de code supplémentaire dans le pilote I2C-HID pour essayer de se rapprocher du comportement implémenté dans Linux. Ce pilote ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant et il est désactivé par défaut (Lt-Henry).
Systèmes de fichiers
Ajout d’un bouchon supplémentaire pour une API qui n’a pas besoin d’être implémentée dans userlandfs-FUSE (qui permet l’utilisation de systèmes de fichiers FUSE sous Haiku). Cette modification permet d’utiliser en particulier le système de fichier squashfs-fuse pour accéder à des volumes squashfs (OscarL).
Toujours dans userlandfs-fuse, propagation de l’état « lecture seule » du système de fichier, ce qui permet au Tracker de clairement afficher ces systèmes de fichiers comme étant en lecture seule (fond de fenêtre grisé, désactivation des opérations modifiant les fichiers) (OscarL).
Dans le système de fichiers UDF, amélioration des messages de logs, et correction d’un kernel panic déclenché par une assertion suite à des modifications précédentes dans le VFS (waddlesplash).
Correction d’un double lock dans le pilote FAT qui pouvait déclencher un kernel panic dans de rare cas (Jim906).
Intégration d’une partie des patchs permettant de redimensionner une partition BFS. Ce travail avait été commencé en 2014 dans le cadre du Google Summer of Code mais n’avait pas pu être terminé dans les temps. La série de patch est restée à l’abandon pendant de longues années, mais elle est en train d’être finalisée pour pouvoir en intégrer au moins une première partie (axeld).
Correction d’un bug sur la gestion des timestamps avec un nombre de secondes entier pour BFS. Historiquement dans BeOS, il n’existait pas d’API POSIX pour stocker une date de modification avec une résolution plus fine qu’une seconde. Cela conduisait de très nombreux fichiers à avoir le poids faible de leur date de modification à 0, avec pour conséquence une dégradation de la répartition dans les tables de hachage pour l’exécution de requêtes. Dans ce cas, BFS stocke une valeur aléatoire générée en interne par le système de fichier dans les bits de poids faible. Le bug était que cette valeur pouvait être exposée à l’espace utilisateur, entraînant de mauvais résultats sur la gestion des comparaisons de dates (par exemple pour déterminer les règles à lancer dans un makefile). La représentation interne a été légèrement modifiée pour bien distinguer les fichiers pour lesquels une date précise a été enregistrée, de ceux pour lesquels il s’agit de bits aléatoires. Ces derniers peuvent ainsi être filtrés et masqués pour l’espace utilisateur (PulkoMandy).
Correction de la gestion des dossiers déjà existants dans write_overlay. Ils'agit d’un système de fichier qui permet de stocker en RAM des écritures temporaires sur un système de fichier monté en lecture seule, utilisé en particulier pour l’exécution en mode live CD (nathan242).
Le pilote BTRFS ne déclenche plus un kernel panic lorsqu’il rencontre un type de compression inconnu, à la place, il retourne simplement une erreur et considère que le fichier ou dossier concerné ne peut pas être lu (AbdullahZulfiqar2005).
Des changements sur les requêtes (pour BFS et les autres systèmes de fichiers capables d’exécuter des requêtes): une petite optimisation du code, une modification pour ne pas notifier les suppressions de nœuds via B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL car elles sont déjà notifiées par d’autres moyens. L’API B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL est maintenant considérée comme stable, et a donc été ajoutée dans la documentation officielle (waddlesplash).
libroot &amp; noyau
Réseau
Implémentation des sockets du domaine UNIX de type SOCK_SEQPACKET. Pour ce faire, modifications de recv et send pour accepter des buffers de taille 0 (pour les socket de type datagramme, pas les streams). Implémentation de MSG_TRUNC et MSG_PEEK pour les sockets du domaine UNIX, et amélioration de la gestion des adresses invalides dans accept et recv pour se rapprocher du comportement de Linux et des BSD (korli).
Implémentation de la découverte de MTU de chemin complet pour TCP et IPv4 (waddlesplash) et IPv6 (cmeerw). L’algorithme mis en place est simpliste, mais permet d’établir des communications dans des cas où le MTU est limité et la fragmentation de paquets n’est pas mise en place.
Nettoyage des buffers mémoire utilisés pour stocker des adresses dans le code de gestion du réseau. Cela corrige un comportement incorrect dans le cas où une adresse de socket UNIX n’est pas terminée par un caractère NUL (cas qui est explicitement autorisé sous Linux car l’information de longueur de l’adresse est disponible par ailleurs) (Anarchos pour la correction du cas où la vérification était oubliée, suivi d’un nettoyage par waddlesplash pour avoir une solution plus systématique à tous les endroits où ce cas particulier doit être pris en compte).
Un socket TCP qui est fermé alors que des données sont reçues par le noyau mais pas encore lues par l’application associée renvoie un paquet RST plutôt qu’un FIN. Ceci corrige un problème détecté dans les tests du langage Go. Modification du comportement lors de la réception d’un reset pendant la fermeture d’un socket TCP pour se comporter comme les autres systèmes (korli).
Déplacement du fichier networks utiliser par getnetent dans le dossier data, avec les autres fichiers de configuration du réseau. Il était placé par erreur dans /etc, qui est son chemin habituel pour d’autres systèmes UNIX (PulkoMandy).
Report d’une correction faite par NetBSD dans le résolveur DNS, il manquait une partie de l’initialisation de certains objets dans l’état du résolveur (cmeerw).
Gestion de l’IPv6: correction d’un problème dans la mise à jour du cache pour le protocole NDP (neighbor discovery), implémentation du multicast (cmeerw).
Remplacement des fonctions inet_net_ntop et inet_net_pton par l’implémentation d’OpenBSD, qui est plus respectueuse du standard que celle de NetBSD utilisée auparavant (korli).
Gestion des processus
Autorisation de l’appel de exec() depuis un autre thread que le thread principal du processus, pour se mettre en conformité avec POSIX et corriger un problème avec les outils de compilation d’OCaml (korli).
Préservation des signaux masqués lors de l’appel à fork (korli).
Mise en conformité POSIX des codes d’erreurs retournés dans certains cas dans la gestion des groupes de processus (waddlesplash).
Bibliothèque C standard
Mise en conformité POSIX-2024:
Ajout des fonctions ffsl et ffsll dans strings.h (korli)
Ajout de getresuid(), setresuid(), getresgid(), setresgid() (korli)
Ajout de la déclaration de posix_spawn_file_actions_add[f]chdir dans les en-têtes publics (la fonction était déjà implémentée mais pas déclarée) (waddlesplash)
Synchronisation de l’implémentation de arc4random avec la dernière version d’OpenBSD (korli).
Correction d’un bug dans la gestion des locales, il n’était pas possible de changer seulement certaines catégories (date, format monétaire, messages), tout était forcément dans la même langue (waddlesplash).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans la famille de fonctions strftime (waddlesplash):
ajout des formats %k et %l,
correction sur la gestion des caractères d'espacement Unicode,
correction de problèmes sur la gestion des fuseaux horaires.
Correction de problèmes mineur de compatibilité POSIX: ajout de déclarations de fonctions et de constantes dans search.h, unistd.h, semaphore.h, nettoyage dans limits.h, définition de getlocalename_l… (waddlesplash).
Remplacement de strtok_r par l’implémentation de musl (waddlesplash).
Refonte du stockage et de la gestion des données ctype pour rendre le code plus facile à maintenir, supprimer des indirections inutiles et corriger un problème de thread safety (waddlesplash).
Nettoyage des fonctions de conversions d’encodage de caractères, et correction de la valeur de MB_CUR_MAX pour l’encodage UTF-8 (waddlesplash).
Définition de la constante DEV_BSIZE (mentionnée dans POSIX mais pas obligatoire) dans sys/param.h, modification de tous le code utilisant stat.st_blocks pour utiliser cette constante, y compris des problèmes dans certains systèmes de fichiers qui utilisaient st_blksize à la place. En effet, il n’y a aucun rapport entre la taille de bloc de st_blksize et le nombre de blocs de st_blocks défini juste à côté (waddlesplash).
Gestion de la mémoire
Correction d’une régression du mois précédent sur la gestion des réservations de mémoire lors du découpage d’areas`. Ajout de la possibilité de transférer des réservations de pages pour les caches et areas réservés, pour éviter de réduire les réservations de façon incorrecte. Cela pouvait causer des assertions et des plantages du noyau en particulier lors de l’exécution d’applications utilisant AddressSanitizer (waddlesplash).
Correction d’une fuite de mémoire dans… la gestion de la mémoire, mis en évidence entre autres par l’exécution du compilateur Rust qui consomme beaucoup de mémoire. Au passage, nettoyage du code et des messages de logs dans cette partie du code (waddlesplash).
Entrées-sorties
Modification de la gestion des requêtes d’entrées-sortie pour autoriser les pilotes de périphériques à sous-classer IORequestOwner. En particulier, cela permet au pilote NVMe d’utiliser ces fonctionnalités sans passer par l’ordonnanceur d’I/O générique qui ne se prête pas bien à l’interfaçage de matériel pouvant traiter plusieurs requêtes en parallèle. Cela permet de simplifier du code, supprimer une fonction récursive devenue inutile et finalement corriger un débordement de pile (waddlesplash).
La taille des partitions indiquée dans le bootloader n’était pas correcte : c’était la taille du disque entier qui était affichée à la place (waddlesplash).
Chargeur de démarrage
Correction de l’affichage de caractères unicode dans le menu de démarrage. En particulier cela évite de corrompre l’affichage lors de la navigation dans le système de fichiers pour désactiver certains pilotes de périphériques. Le firmware UEFI utilise de l’UTF16, tandis que le BIOS utilise une page de code IBM non standardisée. Le bootloader utilise en interne de l’UTF-8 et doit donc convertir les caractères dans le bon format dans chaque cas (madmax).
Implémentation du démarrage via le réseau sur les plateformes EFI (avec un peu de nettoyage sur le support réseau dans OpenFirmware et PXE). Cela fonctionne au moins sur l’architecture ARM 32-bit et facilite le développement sur cible réelle: compilation sur une machine, et exécution sur une autre sans devoir entretemps copier le système de fichiers et le bootloader sur une clé USB ou une carte SD (kallisti5 et PulkoMandy).
Un des en-têtes du bootloader utilisait une syntaxe C++, il a été corrigé pour pouvoir être importé depuis du code C si nécessaire (beaglejoe).
Le chargeur EFI ignore les disques qui ont une taille de bloc de 0 octet, ce qui évite une division par zéro lors de tentatives de lire des données (archeYR).
Systèmes de fichiers
Le noyau interdit maintenant de monter plusieurs fois la même partition. Cette vérification avait d’abord été implémentée dans le pilote FAT, puis via une vérification en espace utilisateur, mais ces deux protections étaient insuffisantes et causaient d’autres problèmes (waddlesplash).
Centralisation de plusieurs vérifications au niveau du VFS, par exemple les vérifications de type fichier ou dossier, les modes d’ouverture des fichiers, des codes d’erreurs retournés pour certaines erreurs spécifiques. Ces changements évitent d’avoir des différences de comportement entre différents systèmes de fichiers et s’assurent que le comportement implémenté est bien celui spécifié par POSIX (waddlesplash).
Implémentation de « fallbacks » pour les systèmes de fichiers qui ne savent pas traiter eux-mêmes les opérations SEEK_DATA, SEEK_HOLE et select(), dont en particulier le write_overlay. Cela permet à la commande cp de fonctionner correctement dans ce cas (nathan242).
Outils de debug
Remise en commun de code pour la gestion du MMU dans le chargeur de démarrage EFI. Le code avait été dupliqué pour chaque architecture de CPU supportés, mais il est en fait en très grande partie identique. Regrouper ce code permet de s’assurer que les évolutions sont bien faites de façon synchronisée pour toutes les architectures (PulkoMandy).
Affichage dans le message de kernel panic de la version de Haiku (numéro hrev). Ceci évite de devoir demander ce numéro aux utilisateurs remontant un bug, il est directement inclus dans la capture d’écran de l’erreur (nathan242).
Modification de la valeur retournée par kernel_version dans les informations système. La valeur retournée par Haiku était la version majeure, qui est 1 depuis le début du projet Haiku en 2001. Elle retourne maintenant une version plus complète qui peut être utilisée dans la commande uname pour indiquer la version de Haiku plus précisément (waddlesplash).
Désactivation de la fonction spécifique à BeOS exect sur les architectures qui n’implémentent pas de compatibilité binaire avec BeOS.
Build system
Ajout d’une macro _DEPRECATED dans les en-têtes de base du système, permettant d’indiquer les classes, méthodes et fonctions qui sont obsolètes et à ne plus utiliser. Cela permet d’avoir un avertissement du compilateur lors de leur utilisation dans le code existant, et de commencer à mettre à jour le code, mais sans casser le code déjà écrit pour l’instant. Actuellement, cette macro n’est pas utilisée, des discussions sont encore en cours sur l’opportunité de retirer certaines APIs.
Remise en état des tests pour le bootloader. Ces tests permettent de lancer une partie du bootloader (dont le menu de configuration) sous forme d’un programme s’exécutant sous Haiku. Cela permet de tester une grande partie du code du bootloader sans avoir besoin de redémarrer le système (waddlesplash).
Ajout d’un script pour convertir une disposition de clavier de la console Linux dans le format reconnu par Haiku (mmu_man).
Mise à jour de paquets pour réparer la compilation en mode « bootstrap » (sans dépendances précompilées) pour ARM et ARM64 (PulkoMandy).
Nettoyage et amélioration de la classe utilitaire FunctionTracer qui permet d’afficher facilement une trace de l’exécution de fonctions, avec une indentation indiquant les appels imbriqués. Il existait plusieurs versions de cette classe utilisées à différents endroits dans le code, chacune avec de légères variations. Renommage de fonctions qui pouvaient entrer en conflit avec l’utilisation de debug_printf et modification de cette dernière pour retourner le nombre de caractères imprimés afin de pouvoir l’utiliser de façon interchangeable avec les autres fonctions de la famille printf (PulkoMandy).
Déplacement de plusieurs en-têtes initialement développés pour une utilisation dans le noyau, de headers/private/kernel/util vers headers/private/util, en effet ils implémentent des fonctionnalités assez génériques (listes chaînées, hash tables, opérations sur les bits…) et sont tout à fait utilisables en dehors du noyau (c’est d’ailleurs déjà le cas à plusieurs endroits dans le code de Haiku) (PulkoMandy et waddlesplash).
Retrait de cas ou l’activation de DEBUG=1 (compilation en mode debug avec des assertions supplémentaires) était empêchée pour certains composants du code (waddlesplash).
Modification du code pour inclure les catalogues de traductions automatiquement dans le paquet contenant l’exécutable correspondant. Ce code incluait également les catalogues de toutes les dépendances, ce qui conduisait les catalogues système de libbe.so à être présents plusieurs fois dans plusieurs paquets, occupant inutilement de la place). Ce changement n’est pas tout à fait terminé puisque maintenant certains catalogues ne sont plus inclus du tout (PulkoMandy).
Modernisation de la page d’accueil de WebPositive pour en permettre l’utilisation avec d’autres navigateurs: définition du bon type MIME, utilisation de HTTPS pour télécharger des ressources externes, déclaration de l’encodage du fichier (humbinger).
Modification du « Makefile Engine » pour autoriser des flags de compilation différents entre les fichiers sources C et C++, ce qui permet d’éviter des warnings de compilation dans certains projets compilant des sources C (OscarL).
Il est maintenant possible de compiler Haiku depuis NetBSD (cmeerw).
Réparation de la compilation de test_app_server (KapiX).
Utilisation de la constante B_DEV_NAME_LENGTH plutôt que de la valeur numérique 128 à plusieurs endroits dans le code (jscipione et OscarL).
Suppression de la dépendance du build à la commande bc, en utilisant à la place des expressions arithmétiques du shell POSIX (PulkoMandy).
Réparation de la compilation des tests unitaires, modification des tests utilisant l’interface graphique pour les exécuter avec test_app_server, ajout d’un package haiku_unittests et d’un profil de build qui inclut ce package dans le système de fichier compilé. L’objectif est de pouvoir lancer ces tests automatiquement dans le cadre de l’intégration continue de Haiku (KapiX, à partir d’un travail plus ancien démarré par kallisti5).
Mise à jour de l’année de copyright à 2026 dans le menu de démarrage et dans les métadonnées des paquets générés par Haiku (PulkoMandy).
Mise à jour des paquets précompilés utilisés pour compiler Haiku avec les dernières versions fournies par HaikuPorts pour les architectures x86 et x86_64. L’outil utilisé pour faire cette synchronisation a reçu lui-même quelques évolutions. Le code de Haiku a été légèrement ajusté pour corriger les problèmes de compilation avec ces nouvelles versions des dépendances (waddlesplash, avec l’aide de madmax pour corriger des problèmes de compilation sur RISC-V qui utilise pour l’instant une version plus ancienne de certains paquets).
Documentation
Haiku book
Le « Haiku book » documente les API publiques et s’adresse aux développeurs d’applications pour Haiku. Il complète et remplace petit à petit le Be Book de BeOS, qui est distribué sous une licence CC-BY-ND ne permettant pas de le mettre à jour et de le corriger.
Ajout du chapitre sur le Device Kit (DigitalBox98)

Changement de tarification de Netlify
Netlify héberge le site www.haiku-os.org. Ils ont récemment modifié leur tarification pour ajouter un système de crédit en fonction de la bande passante consommée. Haiku bénéficie de l’offre « Open Source », avec une certaine quantité de trafic offerte (en échange de l’affichage d’un logo de Netlify en base de page du site). Cette offre s’est révélée insuffisante dans la nouvelle tarification, surtout suite à une attaque de robots (probablement pour l’entraînement de LLM de mauvaise qualité, puisque ils requêtaient des pages n’existant pas et n’obtenaient que des erreurs 404). Du côté de Haiku, des protections ont été mises en place pour éviter ce genre de problème, mais entretemps, Netlify a facturé le dépassement de bande passante autorisée pour le mois de décembre.
Finalement, après une discussion avec l’équipe de support de Netlify et une vérification de ce qu’il s’était passé, la facture a été annulée, et la consommation de bande passante pour Haiku a été augmentée pour mieux convenir à l’utilisation habituelle générée par Haiku.
Remise sur les rails de HSA (Haiku Support Association)
Actuellement, l’association Haiku inc est la principale organisation recevant des dons et finançant les activités de Haiku (développeur employé, coût d’hébergement de l’infrastructure…).
Cette association est basée aux USA, ce qui est récemment devenu une source d’inquiétude pour certains contributeurs et donateurs de Haiku.
Suite à une discussion sur les forums, il y a donc un regain d’intérêt pour la Haiku Support Association, une autre organisation basée en Allemagne et qui était dormante depuis plusieurs années. Plusieurs personnes ont donc adhéré à cette association et cela va peut-être permettre d’en relancer l’activité et d’assurer une présence en Europe.
En particulier, c’est cette association qui organisait la conférence BeGeistert et le traditionnel « coding sprint » associé, permettant aux développeurs et aux utilisateurs de Haiku de se rencontrer régulièrement. Cette activité avait cessé suite au manque de public pour ces évènements, à une perte d’intérêt des membres de l’association, et une absence de nouveaux adhérents pour relancer les choses. Espérons que cette période d’inactivité soit maintenant terminée et que l’organisation de conférences plus régulières puisse reprendre.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Haiku est un système d’exploitation pensé pour les ordinateurs de bureau. Il est basé sur BeOS mais propose aujourd’hui une implémentation modernisée, performante, et qui conserve les idées qui rendaient BeOS intéressant: une interface intuitive mais permettant une utilisation avancée, une API unifiée et cohérente, et une priorisation de l’interface graphique par rapport à la ligne de commande pour l’administration du système.
Il ne s’agit pas d’une distribution Linux, mais d’un système complet avec son propre noyau, sa propre pile graphique, etc. L’idée de cette approche est d’avoir une seule équipe travaillant sur toute la pile logicielle, pour éviter les soucis de coordination entre projets indépendant et d’excès de modularité, qui peuvent aboutir à une architecture logicielle inefficace. En revanche, cela demande un gros travail pour une équipe relativement réduite, et le système est donc en développement depuis bientôt un quart de siècle sans avoir encore publié une version majeure complète.
La cinquième version beta a été publiée en 2024. Les développements continuent pour stabiliser, optimiser et peaufiner le système, avec une version beta 6 prévue en début de cette année, qui sera probablement suivie par une beta 7 quelque temps plus tard.
Cette série de dépêches est basée sur les rapports d’activité publiés mensuellement par le projet Haiku. Cette édition couvre les modifications de Haiku numérotées entre hrev59111 et hrev59355 (soit 244 changements individuels), en plus d’activités se déroulant hors du dépôt Git principal.
Entre parenthèses est indiqué le pseudonyme de l’auteur ou autrice principal·e du changement.

Statistiques de contribution pour 2025
Mise à jour de haiku-format
À quand la beta 6?
Mise à jour de Go en version 1.18
Le mois de novembre a vu l’arrivée d’une grosse mise à jour de la chaîne d’outils pour le langage Go en version 1.18. Il s’agit d’une version de 2022, mais c’est un gros progrès puisque la version précédente disponible pour Haiku était la version 1.4 datant de 2014. De plus, cette version 1.18 est disponible dans le dépôt de paquets et peut être installée normalement avec pkgman (au moins pour les architectures x86 et x86_64).
La plus grande partie du travail a été réalisée par Korli, depuis plusieurs années, pour mettre en place l’environnement de compilation nécessaire, et aussi corriger de nombreux problèmes de compatibilité POSIX dans Haiku qui ont été mis en évidence par les tests de Go.
Cela permet par exemple d’utiliser Hugo, le générateur de site statique utilisé pour le site principal de Haiku. Waddlesplash a donc pu rédiger et vérifier le rapport d’activité de novembre en utilisant uniquement Haiku : avec Hugo, WebPositive (le navigateur natif de Haiku, basé sur WebKit), l’éditeur de texte Koder, ainsi que Iceweasel (un portage de Firefox) pour la correction d’orthographe.
Redémarrage automatique de app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique de Haiku. Il s’agit d’un composant critique, pour lequel un crash rend le système à peu près inutilisable. Waddlesplash a corrigé plusieurs problèmes dans le code pour permettre de redémarrer le serveur après un crash, et de le reconnecter avec les applications en cours d’exécution. Ce redémarrage nécessite encore quelques étapes manuelles car les crash démarrent actuellement le debugger automatiquement, mais cela peut être changé par une simple configuration.
Applications
ActivityMonitor
ActivityMonitor affiche sous forme graphique divers paramètres du système: charge CPU, consommation mémoire… Il peut s’exécuter dans une fenêtre ou bien être intégré au bureau sous forme d’un « réplicant ».
Affichage d’un message « pas de capteurs de température » à la place du graphe de température du système si l’information n’est pas disponible (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème de localisation, certains fichiers sources n’étaient pas pris en compte et les chaînes contenues dedans ne pouvaient pas être traduites (humdinger).
Terminal
Le Terminal permet d’exécuter des applications en ligne de commande.
Synchronisation du presse-papier interne du Terminal avec celui du système seulement une fois au démarrage de l’application, et pas lors du changement d’onglet comme cela avait été implémenté au trimestre précédent (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème qui masquait le signal SIGUSR1 pour les shells et autres processus lancés dans le terminal (korli).
Implémentation des séquences d’échappement permettant aux applications CLI de définir des liens hypertextes (en complément des liens qui étaient déjà détectés automatiquement par le terminal en fonction du contenu du texte) (korli).
HaikuDepot
HaikuDepot est l’interface graphique du gestionnaire de paquets. Il utilise un backend en ligne en Java pour stocker et récupérer les captures d’écrans, et notes d’utilisateurs, icônes des paquets, liste de paquets mis en avant, et d’autres informations.
L’application est plus robuste en cas de problème de réseau : gestion des erreurs et affichage de messages clairs pour l’utilisateur. Gestion en particulier des erreurs 503 remontées par l’API web utilisée par HaikuDepot (apl).
Ajout de filtres pour trouver facilement les applications « natives » (n’utilisant pas Qt ou GTK) et d’un filtre « desktop » pour trouver les applications graphiques (et filtrer un très grand nombre de paquets de bibliothèques, applications en ligne de commande…) (apl, avec des améliorations par humdinger pour clarifier la terminologie).
Amélioration de la taille de la fenêtre des conditions d’utilisation sur les écrans haute densité (nipos).
Refonte de la gestion des identifiants de messages internes à l’application HaikuDepot pour en simplifier la maintenance (apl).
Interdiction de la sélection multiple dans la liste des paquets (apl).
WebPositive
WebPositive est le navigateur web fourni avec Haiku. Il est basé sur le moteur WebKit, co-développé avec Apple, Sony, Igalia et d’autres participants.
Modification du message envoyé au Tracker pour ouvrir le dossier contenant un fichier (par exemple un téléchargement), pour utiliser le message officiellement prévu à cet effet plutôt qu’un moyen détourné (humdinger).
Meilleure gestion des noms de fichiers longs dans la fenêtre de téléchargements avec l’ajout d’une barre de défilement horizontal (mull, avec un petit correctif par humdinger pour corriger un décalage d’un pixel du positionnement de la barre de défilement).
Un chantier est en cours pour réintégrer à nouveau le portage de WebKit pour Haiku dans les sources upstream. Cela avait déjà été fait en 2010, mais n’avait pas été maintenu par la suite, ce qui a conduit à retirer ce code. Depuis, Haiku utilise un fork resynchronisé régulièrement, mais cela génère du travail en plus. L’envoi du code est aussi l’occasion de faire relire toutes les modifications par les autres développeurs de WebKit, avec des conseils pour améliorer et simplifier l’architecture.
Expander
Expander est une application permettant de décompresser des archives.
Correction d’un décalage d’un pixel de la barre de défilement (humdinger).
AboutSystem
AboutSystem affiche quelques informations sur le système et surtout la liste des auteurs de Haiku.
Simplification du code pour la mise à jour automatique des couleurs, mise en place de la mise à jour automatique des couleurs pour la liste des crédits (si on passe en mode sombre par exemple) (jscipione).
Ouverture de la fenêtre avec une taille respectant les proportions du nombre d’or, esthétiquement plus plaisant (axeld).
LaunchBox
LaunchBox est un « dock » permettant de stocker des raccourcis vers des applications ou fichiers fréquemment utilisés.
Correction de la couleur du panneau de LaunchBox, et d’autres couleurs dans le sélectionneur de couleurs standard (nephele).
Tracker
Tracker est l’explorateur de fichiers. Le code du Tracker contient également les fenêtres « ouvrir » et « enregistrer sous », mises à disposition des autres applications sous forme de la bibliothèque libtracker.so.
Envoi de la notification d’activation de l’espace de travail à tous les réplicants, afin que ces derniers puissent ajuster leur couleur (par exemple) en fonction de l’espace de travail actif (jscipione).
Correction du positionnement du champ de texte lors du renommage de fichiers dans la vue par icônes, résolution de problèmes de gestion de l’état des fenêtres après un glisser-déposer avorté, affichage des volumes disque en premier (avant les dossiers) si l’option « trier les dossiers en premier » est active, synchronisation en direct des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers lors du changement d’options, et divers nettoyages de code (jscipione).
Ajout d’une bordure manquante dans les fenêtres de sélection de fichiers (nipos).
Ajout du nombre d’élément sélectionnés (en plus du nombre d’éléments total du dossier) dans les fenêtres du Tracker (nathan242).
Correction d’un problème de concurrence dans le constructeur des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers, dont la conséquence était une mauvaise disposition des contrôles dans la fenêtre (certains boutons apparaissant superposés par exemple (PulkoMandy).
Amélioration de l’image d’aperçu qui suit la souris lors d’un glisser-déplacer lorsqu’on déplace beaucoup de fichiers: l’image est tronquée pour ne pas être trop grande mais le dégradé de transparence sur les bords n’était pas bien calculé (PulkoMandy).
Déclenchement automatique du « renifleur » de type MIME, qui identifie automatiquement les fichiers pour les afficher avec la bonne icône par exemple. En particulier cela rend l’utilisation du Tracker plus confortable sur les systèmes de fichiers ne permettant pas de stocker le type MIME dans un attribut étendu (Jim906).
Correction d’une régression sur la mise à jour en direct des tailles et dates de modification de fichiers dans les résultats de requêtes (waddlesplash).
MediaPlayer
MediaPlayer est une application pour lire des fichiers média (son et vidéo).
Correction de la couleur du texte dans la fenêtre d’informations (nephele).
Dans cette même fenêtre, le champ indiquant le chemin du fichier en cours de lecture est maintenant cliquable (nathan242, dont c’est la première contribution).
Ajout d’une détection automatique du type MIME des fichiers, s’il n’est pas renseigné (par exemple s’il est stocké sur un système de fichiers où il n’y a pas d’attributs étendus) (DigitalBox98).
Sudoku
Sudoku est un jeu de Sudoku, très utile pour patienter pendant une compilation un peu longue.
Amélioration de la palette de couleurs en mode clair (le mode sombre nécessite encore du travail) (axeld).
DeskBar
DeskBar est la barre des tâches de BeOS et de Haiku. La même application contient également le code pour la fenêtre de changement de tâches « Twitcher ».
Correction d’un bug qui faisait apparaître des applications en double dans le « Twitcher » (la fenêtre de changement rapide d’application qui apparaît avec le raccourci Alt+Tab) (madmax).
People
People est un gestionnaire de contacts. Il stocke les contacts dans des fichiers « person » avec les informations sous forme d’attributs étendus.
Correction du défilement avec la molette de la souris ou au touchpad (nipos).
Lecteur MIDI
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
MidiPlayer
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
Changement de la couleur du contrôle de volume qui était codée en dur, non configurable et pas harmonisée avec le reste du système (nipos).
ProcessController
ProcessController affiche la charge CPU et l’occupation mémoire dans la DeskBar. Il permet également d’afficher des statistiques par application, et de débugger et stopper des applications via un menu popup.
Ajustements pour les écrans haute densité : taille des menus, largeur par défaut de l’icône réplicant, autorisation du redimensionnement de la fenêtre principale (la taille est conservée si on installe ensuite un réplicant sur le bureau, et divers autres changements (waddlesplash).
Installer
Installer permet de cloner l’installation de Haiku actuelle vers un autre disque.
Ajout d’un outil pour copier automatiquement le chargeur de démarrage sur la partition EFI du système, pour réduire le nombre d’étapes manuelles pour installer Haiku correctement sur un système EFI (PawanYr, avec des améliorations de kallisti5 pour nommer le fichier installé correctement en fonction de l’architecture CPU du système).
Amélioration du calcul de la taille de la fenêtre « EULA » de l’installeur (qui affiche non pas un contrat de license, mais un message de bienvenue et quelques instructions pour l’installation), en fonction de la taille de texte sélectionnée dans les préférences (nipos).
Mail
L'application Mail permet de lire et de rédiger des e-mail. Elle fonctionne en collaboration avec le mail_server qui s’occupe de l’envoi et de la réception des messages.
Correction d’une régression sur la couleur de fond des champs d’adresse. Mise en place des mises à jour de couleurs automatiques. Les champs désactivés ou en lecture seule sont maintenant « navigables » (avec la touche tab) et le texte peut être sélectionné et copié (jscipione).
Les boutons « suivant » et « précédent » peuvent être accompagnés de la touche Maj. (Shift), pour changer de message sans modifier le statut « lu » des messages (humdinger).
DriveSetup
DriveSetup permet de configurer les supports de stockage: formatage, partitionnement.
L’application s’affiche sur tous les espaces de travail si la DeskBar n’est pas lancée. Ce cas particulier est utile lors du lancement de l’installation de Haiku, dans ce cas, le bureau n’est pas lancé, mais il est tout de même possible d’utiliser plusieurs espaces de travail, ce qui peut donner l’impression que les fenêtres ont disparu si on se retrouve sur un espace vide (PulkoMandy).
Finalisation d’un patch datant d’il y a plusieurs années pour ajouter un menu permettant d’écrire ou de lire des images disques depuis ou vers des partitions (plus besoin d’utiliser dd en ligne de commande) (sed4096, avec l’aide d’humdinger pour des améliorations de localisation et de choix de vocabulaire).
Debugger
Debugger permet de débugger les logiciels fonctionnant dans Haiku.
Correction d’un crash lorsqu’on essaie de débugger des applications trop grosses, par exemples celle utilisant Mesa et llvmpipe pour faire du rendu 3D (waddlesplash).
Changements transverses
Modification de toutes les chaînes de caractères où le nom d’une application est présent (par exemple : « Deskbar preferences »). En effet, le nom des applications peut optionnellement être traduit, et toutes ces chaînes doivent donc s’adapter dans les deux cas (nom d’application traduit ou conservé en anglais selon les préférences de l’utilisateur). Auparavant ce réglage ne pouvait pas être appliqué de façon systématique (humdinger).
Fenêtres de préférences
Réseau
Affichage de l’état précis des interfaces réseau (en cours de configuration DHCP, par exemple) et pas seulement « hors ligne » ou « en ligne » (nipos).
Périphériques d’entrée
Ajout et amélioration de plusieurs options pour la gestion des touchpad (samuelrp84). Voir plus bas les informations sur la réécriture du pilote Elantech qui donne plus de détails.
Apparence
Envoi d’un seul message de mise à jour aux applications lorsque plusieurs couleurs changent simultanément, ce qui est plus efficace et réduit les « clignotements » d’applications dans certains cas (nephele).
Correction de la hauteur des fausses barres de défilement visibles dans la fenêtre d’apparence pour configurer les barres de défilement (jscipione).
Outils en ligne de commande
Le réplicant NetworkStatus peut être installé dans la DeskBar via la ligne de commande même lorsque une fenêtre de NetworkStatus est déjà ouverte (nipos).
Ajout dans strace de l’affichage des structures stat, sockopt, sigset_t, sigprocmask et des noms de signaux (korli avec un correctif par nathan242).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans l’interface en ligne de commande du Debugger, qui conduisaient entre autres à un gel de l’application. Cette interface est surtout utilisée en cas de crash d’un service critique (app_server, registrar, input_server) qui empêcherait l’utilisation de l’interface graphique. Les investigations sur ces services en cas de crash sont donc facilitées.
Modification de bfs_tools pour rendre ces outils compilables sur le système hôte utilisé pour compiler Haiku (axeld). Ces outils permettent de manipuler à la main un système de fichiers bfs, de récupérer certaines données sur un disque corrompu, et diverses manipulations de bas niveau.
Modification de l’outil makebootable pour vérifier que la partition à rendre bootable est bien une partition BFS. Utiliser l’outil sur une partition d’un autre format ou sur un disque complet pourrait corrompre le système de fichier et rendre les données inaccessibles. Ajout d’un message indiquant lorsque le lancement de makebootable n’est pas nécessaire, car les utilisateurs continuent de recommander de lancer cet outil sans aucune raison pour corriger des problèmes de démarrage (encourageant ainsi les nouveaux utilisateurs à faire dea mauvaises manipulations et à corrompre leur système de fichiers) (PulkoMandy).
Suppression d’une verrue dans checkfs qui n’est plus nécessaire suite à des améliorations du Storage Kit. Cela permet de lancer checkfs pour vérifier une partition en donnant le chemin de n’importe quel fichier contenu dans la partition (waddlesplash).
Activation du support de l’IPv6 dans telnet, implémentation dans netstat (avec des corrections sur les opérateurs de filtrage), et ajout de traceroute6 compilé à partir des sources fournies par NetBSD (cmeerw).
Amélioration de l’affichage de df avec plus d’informations, un listage sur deux lignes, et l’ajout d’une option pour afficher les informations standardisées dans le format imposé par POSIX (nipos et PulkoMandy).
Kits
Interface
L'interface kit se charge de tout l’affichage de fenêtres à l’écran et des contrôles de base (boutons, cases à cocher…)
Correction d’un bug dans le contrôle calendrier lors du déplacement vers les mois suivant ou précédent (nipos).
Correction d’un problème de navigation au clavier dans une ListView après l’insertion de nouveaux objets (nipos).
BControl (la classe parente de tous les contrôles d’interface graphique) ne change plus ses couleurs dans la fonction AttachedToWindow(). Ce n’est plus nécessaire après d’autres changements dans BButton, et cela simplifie le code nécessaire pour personnaliser la couleur d’un contrôle spécifique (pour avoir, par exemple, un bouton rouge) (jscipione).
Améliorations sur BSlider: correction de la couleur du texte, nettoyage du code de dessin des sliders dans les implémentations de ControlLook (jscipione).
Augmentation de la taille des marques sur les boutons des barres de défilement (marques qui ne sont pas activées à moins de modifier manuellement un fichier de configuration) pour les rendre plus visibles sur les hautes résolutions (jscipione).
Les infobulles utilisent un espacement calculé en fonction de la taille du texte, pour une apparence plus jolie sur les écrans à haute densité (waddlesplash).
Séparation du titre des onglets et du nom des vues qui leurs sont attachées. Le comportement original est hérité de BeOS, il est donc préservé pour les anciennes applications. Mais pour les nouvelles applications, le nom interne des vues ne doit pas être traduit (il peut être utilisé par des scripts ou par le code de l’application), tandis que le titre affiché à l’utilisateur doit l’être. C’était le seul endroit où ce principe de séparation du nom et du texte affiché n’était pas respecté (KapiX et PulkoMandy).
Dans BTextView, la fonction « tout sélectionner » déplace le curseur à la fin de la sélection (et à la fin du texte). C’est le comportement de la plupart des autres systèmes, et préserver la position du curseur dans ce cas ne semble pas particulièrement utile (OscarL).
Correction de problèmes de choix de couleurs dans le code qui dessine des sliders avec un curseur triangulaire (nipos). Cette correction a permis d’utiliser ce type de slider dans les fenêtres de réglages de différents traducteurs d’images.
Amélioration de l’apparence des cases à cocher partiellement cochées. Elles s’affichent avec un signe "-" au lieu d’une croix. Auparavant, la couleur était subtilement modifiée mais ce n’était pas très visible (PulkoMandy).
Implémentation de la lecture d’un son dans BAlert, qui peut être activé dans les préférences de son (sed4096).
Storage
Le storage kit permet de contrôler les disques et supports de stockage (liste des partitions, montage et démontage, accès aux fichiers, chemins d’accès, requêtes…)
BPartition retourne une erreur B_BUSY si on essaie de monter une partition qui est déjà montée à un autre endroit, au lieu de la monter une deuxième fois (jscipione).
Device
Le device kit permet l’interaction directe avec certains périphériques (USB, série, joysticks…) directement depuis l’espace utilisateur.
Correction de problèmes de gestion de la mémoire dans BUSBInterface mis en évidence par AtomoZero lors d’expérimentations pour corriger le pilote de webcam à l’aide d’un LLM (waddlesplash).
Package
Le package kit se charge de la résolution des dépendances entre paquets et du téléchargement des paquets à installer. Il fonctionne en collaboration avec le système de fichier packagefs qui permet d’accéder au contenu des paquets une fois installés.
Retravail de BRepositoryCache pour remonter les informations sur les paquets via un callback plutôt que de remplir une structure BPackageInfoSet. Cela économise beaucoup de mémoire et d’allocations mémoire, et rend donc la lecture des dépôts de paquets plus rapide (waddlesplash).
Serveurs
Notifications
Le serveur de notifications permet d’afficher des notifications pour les évènements importants.
Les notifications déjà affichées changent de position immédiatement lorsque la configuration est modifiée pour les déplacer (nipos).
Ajout de la lecture de l’effet sonore choisi dans les préférences de son lors de l’apparition des différents types de notification, et à chaque pourcent de progression pour les notifications contenant une barre de progression (sed4096).
Choix de couleurs plus visibles en mode sombre pour les icônes de fermeture et de repli des notifications en mode sombre (nipos).
Network
Le serveur de réseau se charge de la configuration des interfaces réseau, de la configuration des routes et d’autres aspects liés à la communication en réseau.
Refonte du client DHCP dans net_server pour l’exécuter dans un thread séparé et ne pas bloquer la boucle de messages principale. Cela corrige plusieurs cas de gel du serveur lui-même et d’application qui communiquent avec de façon synchrone, par exemple les préférences de réseau. Cela permet également de plus facilement arrêter les requêtes DHCP lorsqu’une interface est reconfigurée avec une adresse statique (waddlesplash).
app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique gérant l’affichage à l’écran.
Correction de crashs causés par des verrous de concurrence manquants et des opérations effectuées dans le mauvais ordre (waddlesplash).
Retrait d’identifiants de messages qui n’étaient plus utilisés dans le protocole de communication entre les applications et le serveur graphique (X512).
Ajout du code nécessaire pour le tracé de lignes avec un dégradé de couleur (dans app_server et dans BView). Auparavant, les dégradés étaient utilisables uniquement pour le remplissage des formes et pas pour les contours (x512).
Modifications de BPicturePlayer pour utiliser une classe C++ avec de l’héritage plutôt qu’une structure C contenant des pointeurs de fonctions. Cela permet de vérifier que l’interface est implémentée correctement par les différents utilisateurs de cette classe dès la compilation (X512).
Implémentation de méthodes manquantes dans BoundingBox player, une implémentation de BPicturePlayer qui calcule un rectangle assez grand pour contenir tout le dessin réalisé par un objet BPicture rejoué via BPicturePlayer (KapiX).
Retrait d’une optimisation incorrecte dans le traitement des calques avec une opacité globale de 100% dans app_server. Ces calques peuvent tout de même contenir des pixels avec de la transparence, et doivent donc être applatis en tenant compte du canal alpha comme tous les autres calques (KapiX).
Modification du protocole app_server pour l’opération permettant de récupérer les « bounding boxes » pour chaque caractère d’une chaîne. L’interface précédente utilisait un tableau de structures, la nouvelle API est inversée ce qui permet d’envoyer plus efficacement 2 tableaux de types primitifs (X512).
Pilotes de périphériques
Implémentation correcte des timeouts sur les commandes dans le pilote SDHCI, ce qui corrige la compatibilité avec plusieurs lecteurs de cartes SD (PulkoMandy).
Réécriture complète du pilote pour les touchpads Elantech. Cette série de changements retouche tout d’abord la gestion des touchpads en général, avec des améliorations sur la documentation, sur le traitement des données invalides, la configuration par défaut, et un nettoyage du code.
Ensuite, le code pour la reconnaissance de « gestures » a été amélioré pour mieux reconnaître plusieurs mouvements tels que le « tap » pour cliquer, le défilement en faisant glsser 2 doigts sur le touchpad, etc. Les préférences du touchpad ont reçu plusieurs nouvelles cases à cocher pour configurer ces différentes options.
Enfin, la dernière partie du patch met à jour le pilote Elantech pour reconnaître les 4 versions du protocole, dont la dernière est entièrement testée. La version 2 ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant (elle a été désactivée pour l’instant) et les versions 1 et 3 sont activées de façon expérimentale dans les nightly builds en attendant les retours d’utilisateurs (samuelrp84).
Normalisation des noms de volumes générés par le pilote usb_disk pour s’assurer qu’ils ne commencent pas par des espaces (madmax).
Mise à jour de la couche de compatibilité FreeBSD avec FreeBSD 15 et synchronisation de tous les pilotes réseau (ethernet et wifi) concernés avec ceux de FreeBSD 15. Synchronisation du pilote rtl8125 avec OpenBSD (waddlesplash).
Ajout de « quirks » et de code supplémentaire dans le pilote I2C-HID pour essayer de se rapprocher du comportement implémenté dans Linux. Ce pilote ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant et il est désactivé par défaut (Lt-Henry).
Systèmes de fichiers
Ajout d’un bouchon supplémentaire pour une API qui n’a pas besoin d’être implémentée dans userlandfs-FUSE (qui permet l’utilisation de systèmes de fichiers FUSE sous Haiku). Cette modification permet d’utiliser en particulier le système de fichier squashfs-fuse pour accéder à des volumes squashfs (OscarL).
Toujours dans userlandfs-fuse, propagation de l’état « lecture seule » du système de fichier, ce qui permet au Tracker de clairement afficher ces systèmes de fichiers comme étant en lecture seule (fond de fenêtre grisé, désactivation des opérations modifiant les fichiers) (OscarL).
Dans le système de fichiers UDF, amélioration des messages de logs, et correction d’un kernel panic déclenché par une assertion suite à des modifications précédentes dans le VFS (waddlesplash).
Correction d’un double lock dans le pilote FAT qui pouvait déclencher un kernel panic dans de rare cas (Jim906).
Intégration d’une partie des patchs permettant de redimensionner une partition BFS. Ce travail avait été commencé en 2014 dans le cadre du Google Summer of Code mais n’avait pas pu être terminé dans les temps. La série de patch est restée à l’abandon pendant de longues années, mais elle est en train d’être finalisée pour pouvoir en intégrer au moins une première partie (axeld).
Correction d’un bug sur la gestion des timestamps avec un nombre de secondes entier pour BFS. Historiquement dans BeOS, il n’existait pas d’API POSIX pour stocker une date de modification avec une résolution plus fine qu’une seconde. Cela conduisait de très nombreux fichiers à avoir le poids faible de leur date de modification à 0, avec pour conséquence une dégradation de la répartition dans les tables de hachage pour l’exécution de requêtes. Dans ce cas, BFS stocke une valeur aléatoire générée en interne par le système de fichier dans les bits de poids faible. Le bug était que cette valeur pouvait être exposée à l’espace utilisateur, entraînant de mauvais résultats sur la gestion des comparaisons de dates (par exemple pour déterminer les règles à lancer dans un makefile). La représentation interne a été légèrement modifiée pour bien distinguer les fichiers pour lesquels une date précise a été enregistrée, de ceux pour lesquels il s’agit de bits aléatoires. Ces derniers peuvent ainsi être filtrés et masqués pour l’espace utilisateur (PulkoMandy).
Correction de la gestion des dossiers déjà existants dans write_overlay. Ils'agit d’un système de fichier qui permet de stocker en RAM des écritures temporaires sur un système de fichier monté en lecture seule, utilisé en particulier pour l’exécution en mode live CD (nathan242).
Le pilote BTRFS ne déclenche plus un kernel panic lorsqu’il rencontre un type de compression inconnu, à la place, il retourne simplement une erreur et considère que le fichier ou dossier concerné ne peut pas être lu (AbdullahZulfiqar2005).
Des changements sur les requêtes (pour BFS et les autres systèmes de fichiers capables d’exécuter des requêtes): une petite optimisation du code, une modification pour ne pas notifier les suppressions de nœuds via B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL car elles sont déjà notifiées par d’autres moyens. L’API B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL est maintenant considérée comme stable, et a donc été ajoutée dans la documentation officielle (waddlesplash).
libroot &amp; noyau
Réseau
Implémentation des sockets du domaine UNIX de type SOCK_SEQPACKET. Pour ce faire, modifications de recv et send pour accepter des buffers de taille 0 (pour les socket de type datagramme, pas les streams). Implémentation de MSG_TRUNC et MSG_PEEK pour les sockets du domaine UNIX, et amélioration de la gestion des adresses invalides dans accept et recv pour se rapprocher du comportement de Linux et des BSD (korli).
Implémentation de la découverte de MTU de chemin complet pour TCP et IPv4 (waddlesplash) et IPv6 (cmeerw). L’algorithme mis en place est simpliste, mais permet d’établir des communications dans des cas où le MTU est limité et la fragmentation de paquets n’est pas mise en place.
Nettoyage des buffers mémoire utilisés pour stocker des adresses dans le code de gestion du réseau. Cela corrige un comportement incorrect dans le cas où une adresse de socket UNIX n’est pas terminée par un caractère NUL (cas qui est explicitement autorisé sous Linux car l’information de longueur de l’adresse est disponible par ailleurs) (Anarchos pour la correction du cas où la vérification était oubliée, suivi d’un nettoyage par waddlesplash pour avoir une solution plus systématique à tous les endroits où ce cas particulier doit être pris en compte).
Un socket TCP qui est fermé alors que des données sont reçues par le noyau mais pas encore lues par l’application associée renvoie un paquet RST plutôt qu’un FIN. Ceci corrige un problème détecté dans les tests du langage Go. Modification du comportement lors de la réception d’un reset pendant la fermeture d’un socket TCP pour se comporter comme les autres systèmes (korli).
Déplacement du fichier networks utiliser par getnetent dans le dossier data, avec les autres fichiers de configuration du réseau. Il était placé par erreur dans /etc, qui est son chemin habituel pour d’autres systèmes UNIX (PulkoMandy).
Report d’une correction faite par NetBSD dans le résolveur DNS, il manquait une partie de l’initialisation de certains objets dans l’état du résolveur (cmeerw).
Gestion de l’IPv6: correction d’un problème dans la mise à jour du cache pour le protocole NDP (neighbor discovery), implémentation du multicast (cmeerw).
Remplacement des fonctions inet_net_ntop et inet_net_pton par l’implémentation d’OpenBSD, qui est plus respectueuse du standard que celle de NetBSD utilisée auparavant (korli).
Gestion des processus
Autorisation de l’appel de exec() depuis un autre thread que le thread principal du processus, pour se mettre en conformité avec POSIX et corriger un problème avec les outils de compilation d’OCaml (korli).
Préservation des signaux masqués lors de l’appel à fork (korli).
Mise en conformité POSIX des codes d’erreurs retournés dans certains cas dans la gestion des groupes de processus (waddlesplash).
Bibliothèque C standard
Mise en conformité POSIX-2024:
Ajout des fonctions ffsl et ffsll dans strings.h (korli)
Ajout de getresuid(), setresuid(), getresgid(), setresgid() (korli)
Ajout de la déclaration de posix_spawn_file_actions_add[f]chdir dans les en-têtes publics (la fonction était déjà implémentée mais pas déclarée) (waddlesplash)
Synchronisation de l’implémentation de arc4random avec la dernière version d’OpenBSD (korli).
Correction d’un bug dans la gestion des locales, il n’était pas possible de changer seulement certaines catégories (date, format monétaire, messages), tout était forcément dans la même langue (waddlesplash).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans la famille de fonctions strftime (waddlesplash):
ajout des formats %k et %l,
correction sur la gestion des caractères d'espacement Unicode,
correction de problèmes sur la gestion des fuseaux horaires.
Correction de problèmes mineur de compatibilité POSIX: ajout de déclarations de fonctions et de constantes dans search.h, unistd.h, semaphore.h, nettoyage dans limits.h, définition de getlocalename_l… (waddlesplash).
Remplacement de strtok_r par l’implémentation de musl (waddlesplash).
Refonte du stockage et de la gestion des données ctype pour rendre le code plus facile à maintenir, supprimer des indirections inutiles et corriger un problème de thread safety (waddlesplash).
Nettoyage des fonctions de conversions d’encodage de caractères, et correction de la valeur de MB_CUR_MAX pour l’encodage UTF-8 (waddlesplash).
Définition de la constante DEV_BSIZE (mentionnée dans POSIX mais pas obligatoire) dans sys/param.h, modification de tous le code utilisant stat.st_blocks pour utiliser cette constante, y compris des problèmes dans certains systèmes de fichiers qui utilisaient st_blksize à la place. En effet, il n’y a aucun rapport entre la taille de bloc de st_blksize et le nombre de blocs de st_blocks défini juste à côté (waddlesplash).
Gestion de la mémoire
Correction d’une régression du mois précédent sur la gestion des réservations de mémoire lors du découpage d’areas`. Ajout de la possibilité de transférer des réservations de pages pour les caches et areas réservés, pour éviter de réduire les réservations de façon incorrecte. Cela pouvait causer des assertions et des plantages du noyau en particulier lors de l’exécution d’applications utilisant AddressSanitizer (waddlesplash).
Correction d’une fuite de mémoire dans… la gestion de la mémoire, mis en évidence entre autres par l’exécution du compilateur Rust qui consomme beaucoup de mémoire. Au passage, nettoyage du code et des messages de logs dans cette partie du code (waddlesplash).
Entrées-sorties
Modification de la gestion des requêtes d’entrées-sortie pour autoriser les pilotes de périphériques à sous-classer IORequestOwner. En particulier, cela permet au pilote NVMe d’utiliser ces fonctionnalités sans passer par l’ordonnanceur d’I/O générique qui ne se prête pas bien à l’interfaçage de matériel pouvant traiter plusieurs requêtes en parallèle. Cela permet de simplifier du code, supprimer une fonction récursive devenue inutile et finalement corriger un débordement de pile (waddlesplash).
La taille des partitions indiquée dans le bootloader n’était pas correcte : c’était la taille du disque entier qui était affichée à la place (waddlesplash).
Chargeur de démarrage
Correction de l’affichage de caractères unicode dans le menu de démarrage. En particulier cela évite de corrompre l’affichage lors de la navigation dans le système de fichiers pour désactiver certains pilotes de périphériques. Le firmware UEFI utilise de l’UTF16, tandis que le BIOS utilise une page de code IBM non standardisée. Le bootloader utilise en interne de l’UTF-8 et doit donc convertir les caractères dans le bon format dans chaque cas (madmax).
Implémentation du démarrage via le réseau sur les plateformes EFI (avec un peu de nettoyage sur le support réseau dans OpenFirmware et PXE). Cela fonctionne au moins sur l’architecture ARM 32-bit et facilite le développement sur cible réelle: compilation sur une machine, et exécution sur une autre sans devoir entretemps copier le système de fichiers et le bootloader sur une clé USB ou une carte SD (kallisti5 et PulkoMandy).
Un des en-têtes du bootloader utilisait une syntaxe C++, il a été corrigé pour pouvoir être importé depuis du code C si nécessaire (beaglejoe).
Le chargeur EFI ignore les disques qui ont une taille de bloc de 0 octet, ce qui évite une division par zéro lors de tentatives de lire des données (archeYR).
Systèmes de fichiers
Le noyau interdit maintenant de monter plusieurs fois la même partition. Cette vérification avait d’abord été implémentée dans le pilote FAT, puis via une vérification en espace utilisateur, mais ces deux protections étaient insuffisantes et causaient d’autres problèmes (waddlesplash).
Centralisation de plusieurs vérifications au niveau du VFS, par exemple les vérifications de type fichier ou dossier, les modes d’ouverture des fichiers, des codes d’erreurs retournés pour certaines erreurs spécifiques. Ces changements évitent d’avoir des différences de comportement entre différents systèmes de fichiers et s’assurent que le comportement implémenté est bien celui spécifié par POSIX (waddlesplash).
Implémentation de « fallbacks » pour les systèmes de fichiers qui ne savent pas traiter eux-mêmes les opérations SEEK_DATA, SEEK_HOLE et select(), dont en particulier le write_overlay. Cela permet à la commande cp de fonctionner correctement dans ce cas (nathan242).
Outils de debug
Remise en commun de code pour la gestion du MMU dans le chargeur de démarrage EFI. Le code avait été dupliqué pour chaque architecture de CPU supportés, mais il est en fait en très grande partie identique. Regrouper ce code permet de s’assurer que les évolutions sont bien faites de façon synchronisée pour toutes les architectures (PulkoMandy).
Affichage dans le message de kernel panic de la version de Haiku (numéro hrev). Ceci évite de devoir demander ce numéro aux utilisateurs remontant un bug, il est directement inclus dans la capture d’écran de l’erreur (nathan242).
Modification de la valeur retournée par kernel_version dans les informations système. La valeur retournée par Haiku était la version majeure, qui est 1 depuis le début du projet Haiku en 2001. Elle retourne maintenant une version plus complète qui peut être utilisée dans la commande uname pour indiquer la version de Haiku plus précisément (waddlesplash).
Désactivation de la fonction spécifique à BeOS exect sur les architectures qui n’implémentent pas de compatibilité binaire avec BeOS.
Build system
Ajout d’une macro _DEPRECATED dans les en-têtes de base du système, permettant d’indiquer les classes, méthodes et fonctions qui sont obsolètes et à ne plus utiliser. Cela permet d’avoir un avertissement du compilateur lors de leur utilisation dans le code existant, et de commencer à mettre à jour le code, mais sans casser le code déjà écrit pour l’instant. Actuellement, cette macro n’est pas utilisée, des discussions sont encore en cours sur l’opportunité de retirer certaines APIs.
Remise en état des tests pour le bootloader. Ces tests permettent de lancer une partie du bootloader (dont le menu de configuration) sous forme d’un programme s’exécutant sous Haiku. Cela permet de tester une grande partie du code du bootloader sans avoir besoin de redémarrer le système (waddlesplash).
Ajout d’un script pour convertir une disposition de clavier de la console Linux dans le format reconnu par Haiku (mmu_man).
Mise à jour de paquets pour réparer la compilation en mode « bootstrap » (sans dépendances précompilées) pour ARM et ARM64 (PulkoMandy).
Nettoyage et amélioration de la classe utilitaire FunctionTracer qui permet d’afficher facilement une trace de l’exécution de fonctions, avec une indentation indiquant les appels imbriqués. Il existait plusieurs versions de cette classe utilisées à différents endroits dans le code, chacune avec de légères variations. Renommage de fonctions qui pouvaient entrer en conflit avec l’utilisation de debug_printf et modification de cette dernière pour retourner le nombre de caractères imprimés afin de pouvoir l’utiliser de façon interchangeable avec les autres fonctions de la famille printf (PulkoMandy).
Déplacement de plusieurs en-têtes initialement développés pour une utilisation dans le noyau, de headers/private/kernel/util vers headers/private/util, en effet ils implémentent des fonctionnalités assez génériques (listes chaînées, hash tables, opérations sur les bits…) et sont tout à fait utilisables en dehors du noyau (c’est d’ailleurs déjà le cas à plusieurs endroits dans le code de Haiku) (PulkoMandy et waddlesplash).
Retrait de cas ou l’activation de DEBUG=1 (compilation en mode debug avec des assertions supplémentaires) était empêchée pour certains composants du code (waddlesplash).
Modification du code pour inclure les catalogues de traductions automatiquement dans le paquet contenant l’exécutable correspondant. Ce code incluait également les catalogues de toutes les dépendances, ce qui conduisait les catalogues système de libbe.so à être présents plusieurs fois dans plusieurs paquets, occupant inutilement de la place). Ce changement n’est pas tout à fait terminé puisque maintenant certains catalogues ne sont plus inclus du tout (PulkoMandy).
Modernisation de la page d’accueil de WebPositive pour en permettre l’utilisation avec d’autres navigateurs: définition du bon type MIME, utilisation de HTTPS pour télécharger des ressources externes, déclaration de l’encodage du fichier (humbinger).
Modification du « Makefile Engine » pour autoriser des flags de compilation différents entre les fichiers sources C et C++, ce qui permet d’éviter des warnings de compilation dans certains projets compilant des sources C (OscarL).
Il est maintenant possible de compiler Haiku depuis NetBSD (cmeerw).
Réparation de la compilation de test_app_server (KapiX).
Utilisation de la constante B_DEV_NAME_LENGTH plutôt que de la valeur numérique 128 à plusieurs endroits dans le code (jscipione et OscarL).
Suppression de la dépendance du build à la commande bc, en utilisant à la place des expressions arithmétiques du shell POSIX (PulkoMandy).
Réparation de la compilation des tests unitaires, modification des tests utilisant l’interface graphique pour les exécuter avec test_app_server, ajout d’un package haiku_unittests et d’un profil de build qui inclut ce package dans le système de fichier compilé. L’objectif est de pouvoir lancer ces tests automatiquement dans le cadre de l’intégration continue de Haiku (KapiX, à partir d’un travail plus ancien démarré par kallisti5).
Mise à jour de l’année de copyright à 2026 dans le menu de démarrage et dans les métadonnées des paquets générés par Haiku (PulkoMandy).
Mise à jour des paquets précompilés utilisés pour compiler Haiku avec les dernières versions fournies par HaikuPorts pour les architectures x86 et x86_64. L’outil utilisé pour faire cette synchronisation a reçu lui-même quelques évolutions. Le code de Haiku a été légèrement ajusté pour corriger les problèmes de compilation avec ces nouvelles versions des dépendances (waddlesplash, avec l’aide de madmax pour corriger des problèmes de compilation sur RISC-V qui utilise pour l’instant une version plus ancienne de certains paquets).
Documentation
Haiku book
Le « Haiku book » documente les API publiques et s’adresse aux développeurs d’applications pour Haiku. Il complète et remplace petit à petit le Be Book de BeOS, qui est distribué sous une licence CC-BY-ND ne permettant pas de le mettre à jour et de le corriger.
Ajout du chapitre sur le Device Kit (DigitalBox98)
Correction d’une documentation inversée pour un paramètre de BKeyStore (PulkoMandy)
Ajout de documentation pour BSimpleGameSound, BSerialPort, MailAttachment, MailDaemon, mail_encoding (cafeina)
Documentation des déviations connues de Haiku par rapport à la spécification POSIX (PulkoMandy).
Documentation interne
La documentation interne s’adresse aux développeurs et développeuses du système Haiku lui-même.
Correction de fautes de frappe dans le chapitre sur les systèmes de fichiers (OscarL).
Autres nouvelles
Changement de tarification de Netlify
Netlify héberge le site www.haiku-os.org. Ils ont récemment modifié leur tarification pour ajouter un système de crédit en fonction de la bande passante consommée. Haiku bénéficie de l’offre « Open Source », avec une certaine quantité de trafic offerte (en échange de l’affichage d’un logo de Netlify en base de page du site). Cette offre s’est révélée insuffisante dans la nouvelle tarification, surtout suite à une attaque de robots (probablement pour l’entraînement de LLM de mauvaise qualité, puisque ils requêtaient des pages n’existant pas et n’obtenaient que des erreurs 404). Du côté de Haiku, des protections ont été mises en place pour éviter ce genre de problème, mais entretemps, Netlify a facturé le dépassement de bande passante autorisée pour le mois de décembre.
Finalement, après une discussion avec l’équipe de support de Netlify et une vérification de ce qu’il s’était passé, la facture a été annulée, et la consommation de bande passante pour Haiku a été augmentée pour mieux convenir à l’utilisation habituelle générée par Haiku.
Remise sur les rails de HSA (Haiku Support Association)
Actuellement, l’association Haiku inc est la principale organisation recevant des dons et finançant les activités de Haiku (développeur employé, coût d’hébergement de l’infrastructure…).
Cette association est basée aux USA, ce qui est récemment devenu une source d’inquiétude pour certains contributeurs et donateurs de Haiku.
Suite à une discussion sur les forums, il y a donc un regain d’intérêt pour la Haiku Support Association, une autre organisation basée en Allemagne et qui était dormante depuis plusieurs années. Plusieurs personnes ont donc adhéré à cette association et cela va peut-être permettre d’en relancer l’activité et d’assurer une présence en Europe.
En particulier, c’est cette association qui organisait la conférence BeGeistert et le traditionnel « coding sprint » associé, permettant aux développeurs et aux utilisateurs de Haiku de se rencontrer régulièrement. Cette activité avait cessé suite au manque de public pour ces évènements, à une perte d’intérêt des membres de l’association, et une absence de nouveaux adhérents pour relancer les choses. Espérons que cette période d’inactivité soit maintenant terminée et que l’organisation de conférences plus régulières puisse reprendre.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld TL;DR: This MacBook Air is only $199.97 right now, and shipping is free.
The RAM shortage is already starting to affect computer prices, but it hasn’t touched refurbished devices yet. If you need a low-cost computer for the basics, this MacBook Air is still a good option for only $199.97 (MSRP $999).
Inside, this MacBook has a 1.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB solid-state drive. That combination is enough for web browsing, note-taking, light photo work, and office productivity. The 13.3-inch display has a 1440×900 resolution, which is sharp enough for documents and video without hammering the battery. You also get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you can connect to wireless networks, headphones, and other accessories without hassle. Fully charged, the battery can last up to 12 hours, which gives you plenty of room during busy days when you can’t sit down at an outlet.
This unit has a Grade “A/B” refurbished rating, which means it’s fully tested but may have light scuffs or small marks on the case. That’s also why the price is so low. It can update to macOS Monterey, which keeps it compatible with most modern software, though it will not move to newer macOS 26 releases. You also get a MagSafe charger in the box and a limited third-party warranty.
Shipping is free.
Right now, you can get a MacBook Air on sale for $199.97.

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld TL;DR: CleanMy Phone scans duplicates, compresses media, and organizes your camera roll so your iPhone feels new again — for just $19.99.
You know the warning: “iPhone Storage Full.” Suddenly, you’re speed-deleting photos from 2017, removing apps you still probably need, and debating whether one blurry brunch pic is worth iCloud rent.
Instead, there’s an affordable and easy solution.
CleanMy Phone (now $19.99, normally $44.99) acts like a spring cleaning crew for your camera roll. The app scans your device and intelligently finds duplicate photos, giant videos, forgotten screenshots, and low-quality shots you didn’t realize were multiplying.
The surprisingly helpful part? It doesn’t just delete — it suggests. AI highlights the best image in a group, compresses videos without wrecking quality, and can even convert Live Photos to standard shots to save serious space.
Everything runs locally on your device, so your photos never leave your phone. No uploading, no weird privacy tradeoffs — just a cleaner library.
It also shows real-time storage analytics, so you finally understand why 40GB vanished overnight (spoiler: videos and memes).
Instead of upgrading storage again, you might just clean it up.
Because most phones don’t need replacing — they need organizing.
Get CleanMy Phone for your iPhone or iPad while it’s just $19.99 (MSRP $44.99). CleanMyPhone Cleanup Storage AppSee Deal

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld TL;DR: Until February 22 at 11:59 p.m. PT, these MacBook Pros are only $430.
Now is a tough time to need a better computer. Tech prices are going up, but that doesn’t mean you can’t upgrade. This 2020 MacBook Pro is in near-mint condition, but it’s still only $429.97 (reg. $1,999) right now.
This 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 quad-core processor that runs at 2.0GHz, so everyday work like browsing, video calls, and document editing feels smooth. It has 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which is plenty of space for apps, photos, and big project files, and it helps the system stay responsive when you have a lot open at once.
The 13.3-inch Retina display runs at 2560×1600 resolution with True Tone, so text looks sharp, and colors are vivid while the screen adjusts to the lighting in your room. Intel Iris Plus graphics handle streaming, light creative work, and general use without drama. The backlit Magic Keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, and the Touch Bar and Touch ID give you quick shortcuts and fingerprint login.
You get four Thunderbolt 3 ports that handle charging, external displays, and fast storage through USB-C. Wireless connections use 802.11ac Wi Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 for modern routers and accessories.
This Grade A refurbished unit should arrive in near-mint condition, with only minor signs of use. It weighs about 3.1 pounds, comes with a charger, and includes a limited third-party warranty.
Get a MacBook Pro while they’re on sale for $430.

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Listen, we love MacBooks around here, but we hate paying Apple’s storage upgrade prices. That’s why today’s deal is so good: B&amp;H Photo is selling the M5 MacBook Pro with 1TB of storage space for $1,599, the same price as the 512GB version. Now that’s a deal worth getting!
So, the 14-inch MacBook Pro M5 is an absolute beast of a laptop that we gave a 4.5-star rating to and our Editors’ Choice award. We loved the improved CPU and GPU performance, as well as how speedy the drive is. We concluded that “the M5 MacBook Pro offers a great combination of price and performance.” And with this deal, you’ll get twice the storage without paying a penny more
The model’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR Display delivers crisp visuals and vibrant colors, as well as an amazing 1,000 nits of brightness that will make it easy to use the laptop in any lighting situation. The laptop also features a slew of ports, including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, USB-C, and an SD card reader, as well as MagSafe for power.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-70-amd-epyc-turin</link>
      <description><![CDATA[When beginning some early Linux 7.0 kernel benchmarking this week for looking at its performance in its early development state, I started off testing on Core Ultra X7 "Panther Lake" in being hopeful for better performance with the maturing Arc B390 Xe3 graphics and the like. But I ended up finding Intel Panther Lake seeing some performance regressions on Linux 7.0. So next up I turned to an AMD EPYC Turin server since if regressions existed there at least it's much faster to carry out bisecting of the kernel performance regressions. But with that initial testing wrapped up, I didn't find any regressions like with Panther Lake and standing out were some rather enticing PostgreSQL database server performance benefits when running atop Linux 7.0.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Electrobun est une nouvelle solution pour développer des apps desktops en TypeScript. Il se veut léger, rapide et basé sur Zig et Bun. Il permet un binding écrit en C++, Zig, le backend est assuré par Bun, et il est multiplateforme (macOS, Windows et Linux). Il a l'ambition de créer des binaires les plus petits possibles, un temps de démarrage très bas et 100 % natif pour l'interface. Electrobun se veut une meilleure réponse qu'Electron. On écrit le coeur de l'application en TypeScript avec des WebView, les deux ensembles sont isolés et communiquent en RPC. Attention, il faut un environnement de développement desktop complet :
- Xcode + cmake sur macOS
- Visual Studio Build Tools our Visual Studio avec les extensions C++ et cmake sur Windows
- webkit2gtk et les paquets GTC, cmake et paquet build-essantial sur Linux

contend with the fact that the UK and other countries are implementing

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple’s long-rumored cheap MacBook appears to have come a step closer to launch, with the discovery that Walmart has stopped selling new units of the low-cost M1 MacBook Air.
As first reported by PC Mag, searching for the late-2020 machine on the U.S. site with the “new” filter checked brings up three buying options: the 256GB in Space Gray or gold, and a listing for the 512GB model, which hasn’t been available since 2024. All three now show as out of stock for shipping, and the reporter was able to find just one store in his local area with units for pickup. I had a similar experience. I’m out of luck, and they’re out of stock.
David Price / Foundry (As a side note, I’ve been unable to find new units of the M1 Air in any other stores close to me, including Amazon. If you check the price-comparison table below, you’ll see if there are any in your location. If the table isn’t showing up at all, that means you’re out of luck, too.)
Retailer Price Check Product Price It isn’t clear how long Walmart has been short of stock for this machine, but we know it was on sale for the bargain price of $549 as recently as mid-December. As it’s unlikely that Walmart just happened to run out of stock after two years, it seems Apple and Walmart have decided to wind down sales.
While the decision could be related to cost-cutting measures due to memory prices ballooning, this timing adds credence to the rumors of a cheap MacBook expected within the next two weeks. Apple recently announced global “experiences” on March 4, and it’s widely rumored that it will announce a series of new entries in its iPhone, iPad, and MacBook lines in the days leading up to that. Rumors about the new MacBook claim it will use an A18 Pro iPhone chip and cost around $699, both reasons to stop selling these M1 models. Whatever the truth, we should find out soon.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066403/macos-26-3-might-have-just-confirmed-apples-biggest-march-4-surprises.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld As we have extensively covered, Apple is rumored to soon introduce new products, as the company recently confirmed a special announcement for March 4. Among the expected products are a low-cost MacBook and a new generation of Studio Display.
If you needed more evidence that these products will soon be arriving in stores, here’s proof from Apple itself. Code from macOS 26.3, released last week to the public, confirms the existence of such devices.
As discovered by Macworld, the final build of macOS 26.3 released to the public on February 11 includes kernel extensions (kexts) for three new devices identified as J700, J427, and J527. The codenames match previous reports, including those based on an internal build of iOS 26 leaked last year.
Low-cost MacBook essentially confirmed
J700 is the codename for the rumored new low-cost MacBook. This Mac is expected to be priced lower than the current MacBook Air, and will be the first Apple silicon Mac to be powered by an A-series chip instead of an M-series one.
More specifically, the new entry-level MacBook will reportedly have the same A18 Pro chip as the iPhone 16 Pro models. Benchmark tests show that the A18 Pro performs slightly better than the M1, which is good enough for most casual users who will be the target audience for this new laptop.
More recently, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the laptop will have a display that’s slightly under 13 inches and will be made of aluminum, despite its lower price. Some analysts believe it will cost as low as $599, but a price between $699 and $799 is more likely. Apple’s Studio Display is nearly four years old and in need of an update. Foundry Studio Display 2 may have an extra surprise
In addition to the highly anticipated MacBook, macOS 26.3 includes drivers for two other unreleased devices: J427 and J527, both variants of a new generation of Studio Display.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066316/the-retro-ipod-that-never-was.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple is known for being secretive about what goes on inside its offices, whether it’s about upcoming products or things from the past. Still, from time to time, we get a glimpse into internal projects that were never meant to see the light of day. What if we told you that Apple once considered launching a “retro iPod”?
Thanks to newly published material by former Apple designer Jon Stoa, we now have a fascinating glimpse into never-before-seen marketing concepts. They not only show scrapped plans for the 2007 iPhone launch, but also concepts for what would have been a special edition iPod classic.
An iPod inspired by the 1984 Macintosh
On his resume webpage, which includes several images for ads, packaging elements, and marketing images created while working at Apple, Stoa shares some of the unreleased projects he worked on at Apple between 2006 and 2008. The most intriguing is the concept for a limited edition “retro iPod,” which would be designed to look like it came straight out of 1984.
The idea was heavily based on a growing trend of nostalgia, even 20 years ago. The material imagines an iPod based on the design of the original Macintosh with a beige finish, classic typography, and the rainbow Apple logo on the back. He writes that the device “would draw from both the present and the past to make a statement about the role of Apple and the iPod in culture, both now and then.” Apple proposed a series of names for its retro “1984” iPod. Jon Stoa Suggested names included iPod retro, iPod rewind, iPod beta, and iPod backspace, all rendered in Apple Garamond, the typography used in Apple’s marketing materials at the time.
The concept went far beyond a vintage design. The marketing material proposed preloading the iPod with some music videos from the 1980s and even classic arcade games such as Pac-Man. Distribution would have been limited, with the retro iPod only available at Apple Stores and selected boutique partners.
There’s no evidence Apple ever developed prototypes for the retro iPod. The materials appear to be unused design and marketing explorations rather than a cancelled product.
Still, the fact that someone inside Apple considered making a vintage edition of the iPod (which was at its peak in 2006) is fascinating. A retro iPod is unlikely to happen now, but it would make an intriguing device. Jon Stoa Could a retro iPod happen in 2026?
Apple officially killed the iPod brand in 2022 when it discontinued the iPod touch, but the more classic iPod nano and iPod shuffle disappeared years earlier. Even so, some people are still calling for the return of the iPod in some form.
Some fans would instantly buy an iPod classic, while others would like a reimagined version of the iPod that blends today’s technologies with the essence of the original iPod.
If Apple were to revisit the idea today, it likely wouldn’t be a straight reissue. Instead, we could imagine a compact device the size of the iPod classic, but built with today’s materials and components. A modern OLED or mini-LED display, haptic feedback to simulate the tactile feel of the Click Wheel, expanded storage options, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support, and deep integration with Apple Music.
Whether Apple would embrace this idea of looking back at its hardware is another question. The company typically prefers to move forward and rarely celebrates milestones such as product anniversaries. But it’s hard to imagine a limited-edition device like this not selling out instantly. The Apple Store cube on 5th Avenue in New York City could have had a light projection show ahead of the iPhone’s launch. Jon Stoa The canceled iPhone event
Stoa’s material also sheds light on Apple’s pre-launch strategy for the original iPhone.
According to the documents, Apple had considered hosting another press event on June 26, 2007, just three days before the iPhone officially went on sale. The event was to be held at The California Theatre in San Jose. Attendees would have received an iPhone-shaped gift card to spend on the iTunes Store.
However, the event never happened.]]></description>

La v2 permet d'assurer l'affichage constant sur plus de montres, proposer un nouveau launcher, des paramètres personnalisables, de meilleures performances, une synchronisation améliorée. La v2 supporte 49 langages, soit 20 de plus par rapport à la dernière version. De nouvelles montres sont supportées : Fossil Gen 4 Watches (firefish/ray)
Fossil Gen 5 Watches (triggerfish)
Fossil Gen 6 Watches (hoki)
Huawei Watch (sturgeon)

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/668468/best-apple-watch-chargers-stands-docks.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple ships a simple but effective charging cable with the Apple Watch that will fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7 or later (Watch 8/9/10/11, Watch Ultra 1/2/3). You won’t find a faster charging accessory but you can also choose from a wide range of stylish and practical charging stands, docks and power banks for your Apple Watch—including some that can also charge other Apple devices such as your iPhone and AirPods.
Here, we round up the best Apple Watch chargers, docks and charging stands—some of which can charge your other Apple devices at the same time. Most should be compatible with all generations of the Watch, but be sure to check compatibility before buying.
See below the product chart for more on Apple Watch fast-charging, including the expected charging times of each Apple Watch.
There are simple charging cables, multi-device chargers that can power up your Apple Watch plus your iPhone and AirPods, chargers that are built for portability and travel, designer models that look great at home or in the office, and handy Apple Watch power banks.
While battery life has improved with the most recent Watch launches, particularly the Apple Watch 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3, you will still find yourself in need of recharging between one and two days.
We’ve tested a lot and selected our favorite Apple Watch chargers here.

Every Apple Watch comes with the company’s Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable. At $29 / £29 it’s not overly expensive to buy a spare or replacement, but there are more able multifunction Watch chargers available, as well as much cheaper simple cables that we would steer clear of but which we have investigated to see if we can find one we can recommend. First we start our best Apple Watch charger roundup with these simple models, and then we test the more functional and better-designed alternatives. Pros
Fast charge Watch
Simple Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal Product Price Watch fast charge: Yes
Size: 1m cable
Weight: 2.6oz (73g)
Colors: White
USB-C charger: Not included (20W charger required)
Apple ships its Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable with its Watch Series 7 and later models, including the Watch Series 8/9/10/11, SE 3 and Watch Ultra. (Earlier Apple Watch SE models and Series 6 and earlier Watches shipped with the Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable that lacks the fast-charging function.)
Both charging cables are Apple white and a meter long. The latest version features an enhanced charging puck that also works with the case of the AirPods Pro 2 &amp; 3 and AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation.
The 7.5W Fast Charger Cable can charge 33% faster than the older 5W cable—charging a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in just 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will support eight hours of sleep tracking.
Without fast charge, it takes about 1.5 hours to charge an Apple Watch to 80%, and about 2.5 hours to 100%.
Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger, like you’d use to charge an iPhone; find our best iPhone chargers for a wider choice that the plain Apple 20W charger.
While you can still buy the older Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable, there’s little benefit as the newer Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable is backwards compatible with older Watch models, looks the same, and is the same price. You can use the old cable on a later Watch but obviously without fast charging. Pros

Size: 1m cable

USB-C charger: Not included (20W charger required)
Apple’s official Watch Charger is fast and reliable but expensive compared to the knock-off Watch chargers you can find online. This is a shame as having a spare in your bag or lying around at home is useful given the Watch’s pretty dreadful battery life.
Usually there is a trusted third-party provider with an alternative to Apple’s simple charging cable but we could find none for the Apple Watch that were cheaper than the Apple version. We know that the Satechi USB-C Fast Charging Cable for Apple Watch is trustworthy as it’s from one of our favorite brands, but it’s actually pricier than the Apple—so why bother, unless you prefer the shorter cable?
There are some great third-party Apple Watch charging stands and adapters—many of which we review below. But you are taking a chance (albeit a very affordable chance) by picking a cheapo simple Watch charger from Amazon, Temu or other online retailers. We bought one from Amazon that frayed its cable sitting in a bag for a few weeks. If you must, then scan the user reviews but we can’t vouch that the good ones are genuine and others often state problems with durability and extremely slow charging. You spent a bunch on your Apple Watch so why risk it going up in flames by saving a few bucks on a spare charger? Pros

USB-C charger: Any USB-C charging port
Small enough to fit in your pocket, this little 5W Watch charger from Satechi can plug straight into a USB-C charger or a USB-C charging port—for example, the Thunderbolt on your MacBook or iPad, a USB-C car charger, or USB-C output power bank.
As we all know, it’s not only the Apple Watch with a weak battery. This portable Watch Charger can also be used to charge AirPods in a compatible case.
When you get an alert telling you that your Watch battery is fading, you don’t always have your meter-long Apple charging cable with you but you are likely nearer a USB-C power point, and this little Watch charger can live at the bottom of your backpack for when you need it most. Pros

The Nimble Watch charging stand can fast-charge the Watch (Series 7 and later), and weighing just 3.2oz (91g) is portable, too. It is made from sustainable plant-based aloe leather.
The magnetic charging module allows the Watch to be raised to work either lying flat or in Nightstand mode. It ships with a separate 5-foot (1.5m) USB-C but requires a USB-C wall charger. Belkin An alternative is the larger (3.8 x 3.8 x 0.63 inches) and heavier (6.8oz) Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch, which is a long name for a fairly simple square, rubberized Apple Watch charging stand. It’s a little more expensive ($59.99), too, but it is available in white as well as black. Its built-in 4-foot (1.2m) USB-C cable wraps neatly around the underside of the dock, so keeping your space clutter-free. There’s a precision dial on the bottom of the dock to raise the puck height depending on the size of your Watch.
Alternatively, you can save money by buying one of the simple Apple Watch stands that require you to connect your Watch charging cable into the basic stand. Pros

Use it as your keychain or simply hang it in a purse or backpack, the simple Scosche WatchIt should be with you at your greatest time of Watch-charging need.
It’s simple to use once you find a USB-C port on a wall charger, your MacBook or even your iPhone (15 or later), you can lie your Watch on the pad and soon enough juice should be in your Watch so you won’t miss any of those precious active minutes. Best 2-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone chargers
If you own an Apple Watch there is a high possibility that you also own an iPhone, so why not have one versatile charger that can power up both Apple devices at the same time. Here are some of the favorites we have tested. Pros
Charges Watch and iPhone
Can swap Watch for AirPods
Fast charge Watch
15W MagSafe for iPhone
Portable
Small footprint Retailer Price View Deal Twelve South View Deal View Deal View Deal Product Price Watch fast charge: Yes
iPhone charge: 15W (MagSafe)
Size: 2.8 x 2.4 x 0.9 inches (7.1 x 6.1 x 2.35cm)
Weight: 4.2oz (119g)
Colors: Aluminum
USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included
Twelve South has triumphed with this pocketable 2-in-1 charger that can handle iPhone and Apple Watch (or Watch and AirPods), charging the two devices simultaneously.
It is fully Apple certified, so fast wirelessly charges the Watch at 5W and the iPhone at 15W. The Watch can’t be charged faster, although you can find 25W wireless chargers for the iPhone.
But its wonder is its clever, dinky foldable size and MacBook-like styling. Unfurl the charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed. You can even fold 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nightstand mode. Flip it round, and you can set the iPhone in landscape StandBy mode.
It chips with a super-compact 30W USB-C wall charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads: US, UK, EU and AU/NZ.
The ButterFly is also our favorite Apple Watch travel charger, but it works back at base just as well. Twelve South You can buy a different (a little pricier at $99.99) version in six different colors—the Twelve South ButterFly SE uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe, so also charges at 15W, but doesn’t ship with a wall charger. Its not metal like the original Butterfly but at least with its color choices (Black, White, Pink, Coastal Blue, Iridescent, Midnight Plum) it resembles more a butterfly than a moth. Pros

USB-C charger: Not included (27W charger required)
Very similar to the Twelve South ButterFly, reviewed above, the Native Union Voyage is a touch larger but also a little lighter. In the same way, it’s a superb travel charger for iPhones after version 12 and Apple Watches. It can fast charge both as it uses 15W Qi2 for iPhone magnetic wireless charging (compared to the ButterFly’s 15W MagSafe but the same Qi2 standard as the ButterFly SE) and 5W for Apple Watch. AirPods can be charged on the Watch part depending on your charging needs.
It is so compact that it will easily fit in your pocket or get lost at the bottom of your backpack—the included pouch is handy in this regard, and something we hoped would be included with the ButterFly.
Like the ButterFly SE (but not the original ButterFly that ships with a 30W USB-C charger) it doesn’t come with a wall charger so you’ll need to add your own. And it is priced the same as the ButterFly SE.
It seems a shame to just compare this very neat 2-in-1 charger to the similar chargers that came before it. It does beat the Twelve South chargers in two respects. We think the Voyage will likely show less wear than the others as its silicone cover looks more hardy. And we like the fact you can just push out the Watch charging module from the back rather than risking your fingernail on the ButterFly’s notch.
Take a look at the Voyage and the ButterFly and ButterFly SE, and make your choice. You won’t be disappointed with any of these dinky and cleverly designed 2-in-1 chargers. Pros

The BoostCharge Pro looks rather like a paperweight and will delight interior designers.
Compact and low-level in an elegant organic shape, the bulb-like charging stand is made from at least 60% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic and has pleasingly soft edges and a texture that makes you stroke it longingly.
The chrome Watch-charging pad sticks out from the back of the stand, and can’t be folded in when not in use, as is possible with some compact multi-device chargers such as the Anker 3-in-1 Cube. It features fast wireless charging for both Watch and iPhone. While it lacks an AirPods charging module like the 3-in-1 charging stations reviewed here, you can charge the AirPods wireless charging case on the top when the charging pad is flat and not charging your iPhone.

Belkin created not one but two UltraCharge Pro Convertible chargers; see also the review below. Both fold up to create a pocketable charging pad and can be unfolded to make a viewing stand. Only this version—they’re both called the same thing so bear with me—can charge both iPhone and Watch when partially folded up.
While not as design-mag gorgeous as the BoostCharge Pro Charging Dock reviewed above, the super-portable UltraCharge Pro Convertible is a foldable compact design marvel nonetheless.
Belkin designates its 15W iPhone chargers as “BoostCharge” and its 25W models as “UltraCharge”. Both will charge the Apple Watch at the same 5W but owners of the iPhone 16 and 17 series will cut around 15 minutes off their charging time with the 25W variety. Pros

It’s got the same name and near identical functions and technical specification as the Belkin UltraCharge Pro Convertible reviewed above, so the choice is all yours and may come down to price. This slightly pricier version is classier with its chrome bar and maybe that’s why Apple chose to sell this model in its Store. It’s also a bit heavier, making the cheaper version better suited to travel.
As the Watch-charging module is folded away under the pad, you can’t charge your Watch while it’s in Pad mode as you can with its non-identical twin. Pros

We list this elegant charging stand as a 2-in-1 because it can charge two types of Apple device: the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, you could argue that it’s a 3-in-1 as it has dual Watch charging pads for families or offices with more than one Apple wearable and can therefore charge two separate devices at the same time.
For such households this charger will help eliminate the need for messy individual charging cables. Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone/AirPod chargers
As well as owning an Apple Watch and iPhone, a fair few of us have further swelled Apple’s coffers by buying AirPods. These are the 3-in-1 chargers that we have tested and approve for simultaneously charging Apple Watch, Apple iPhone and Apple AirPods (with a wireless charging case). Pros

If you’ve got an Apple Watch, chances are you also own an iPhone and maybe a set of AirPods, too. Here’s where a charging station, which can power up all three devices simultaneously, becomes essential if you want to rid yourself of a snake’s nest of cables.
Previously, 3-in-1 chargers were limited to 15W wireless charging either via Apple’s MagSafe or Qi2. Apple’s own iPhone MagSafe Charger has alone been able to charge iPhone 16 and later at 25W. The new Qi2 25W standard, however, means you can get the fastest magnetic charging in a stand without needing to rig it with Apple’s charging puck. In our real-world tests using the iOS 26 beta on our iPhone 16 Pro, we saw actual charging times from 0 to 50 percent of 30-35 minutes, measurably faster than 15W MagSafe.
As with the 25W MagSafe, Qi2 25W requires at least an iPhone 16 running iOS 26 to hit the top wireless charging speed. It and this stand is backwards compatible with older iPhones going back to the iPhone 12 but is pegged back at Qi2’s older 15W limit for those iPhones.
Here we are just as interested in the UltraCharge Pro’s Apple Watch-charging prowess and this is as fast as it gets at 5W.
The base is wrapped in a beautifully soft-touch silicone, while the bar that holds the iPhone and Watch chargers look great in a shiny chrome finish. It’s not the highest stand, but the iPhone charging pad is highly adjustable— up to 70 degrees in portrait or landscape—so it can be angled as you desire. Pros

The HiRise 3 Deluxe (available at Apple) can wirelessly charge three devices—iPhone 12/13/14/15/16/17 (but not SE), Apple Watch 7, 8, 9, SE and Ultra, and Apple AirPods (2nd and 3rd gen AirPods, and all AirPods Pro). The AirPods-charging Qi wireless pad can alternatively be used to charge any iPhone from iPhone 8 up.
The iPhone 15W, Watch 5W and Qi pad 7.5W charging points allow for fast charging, but that 15W iPhone charger is now bested by Qi2 25W chargers as found on the Belkin UltraCharge Pro 3-in-1 stand reviewed above.
The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, and the iPhone in iOS 17’s StandBy mode. You can angle the iPhone by up to 35 degrees. Pros

If you own an Apple Watch it’s a fair bet that you also have an iPhone, and, go on admit it, some AirPods, too—you’re well invested into the Apple ecosystem.
This 3-in-1 charging station from Journey has a tiltable MagSafe-certified pad (15W) for all iPhones 12/13/14/15, plus a Qi charger for AirPods that have a wireless charging case.
Important to us here, though, is the Apple Watch charger at the back, which can fast-charge your Apple wearable.
The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is similar and features a tiltable Watch charger at the front rather than the back. If you want a 3-in-1 fast charging stand in white, then pick this Journey stand or the OtterBox 3-in-1 reviewed below; if you prefer black, go for the Charcoal Belkin UltraCharge Pro.
There is a cheaper version, the Journey Trio 3-in-1 Charging Station, which features a handy detachable Watch charger that you can slip into your pocket and plug into a USB-C charger, including your MacBook, away from the base unit. While that is a neat feature (and might save you $40 on a standalone Watch adapter) the MagSafe pad is only compatible so charges the iPhone at 7.5W and the Watch charger is slower than the one featured on the Trio Ultra 3-in-1.

The first 3-in-1 device charger based on the fast MagSafe-like 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging tech, the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station not only boosts wireless charging speeds that match Apple’s MagSafe but wraps up everything into a solid, foldable and compact yet flexible design. Apple Watch fast charging is the cream on the top.
Foldable and super compact, the Anler MagGo Wireless Charging Station is a great portable option for your travels. The Watch-charging module neatly folds into the base of the charging station. It’s just as great as a permanent charger at home.
We also like Anker’s 3-in-1 Cube, reviewed below—but while it’s gorgeous, it is heavier than the MagGo and doesn’t feature Watch fast charging.
If you can live without the MagSafe wireless charging iPhone stand element, we are rather in love with another Apple Watch charger from the same company, which is also a power bank: the Anker MagGo 10K Power Bank For Apple Watch, reviewed below in our Best Apple Watch Power Banks reviews. Pros

Belkin’s Boost Up Charge Pro Wireless Charging Pad 3-in-1 charger (available at Apple) is the fastest way you can wirelessly charge both your Apple Watch and iPhone (12/13/14/15/16-series models), plus AirPods that come in a wireless charging case. It’s a flat pad so the iPhone charges lying down rather than visible as it would be on a stand.
It boasts both Watch fast charging (7.5W) and iPhone MagSafe fast charging (15W). The included 20W USB-C wall charger is a little underpowered if charging all three devices simultaneously. A 30W or 40W charger would better handle that situation.
The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, but because the iPhone lies flat you can’t take advantage of iOS 17’s StandBy mode. The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is a better option if you want to view your iPhone while it’s charging—and it also comes with a more powerful 40W power supply.
The magnetic charging module features a precision dial that can adjust the height for the best Watch, depending on the screen size. Pros

Matching the Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe in terms of charging speed, the OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station is a super-fast iPhone/Watch/AirPods charger with a small footprint—indeed, it’s a little smaller than its rival.
The charging points for iPhone and Apple Watch are fully certified—iPhone 15W and Watch 5W. At 5W, the lower Qi pad is slower than the Twelve South.
We prefer the HiRise 3 Deluxe for its tilting iPhone MagSafe pad and more flexible Watch module. But if the white color option fits your decor better than the black-only HiRise, the OtterBox 3-in-1 is a great choice. Best Apple Watch travel chargers

      <description><![CDATA[Oracle avait profité de la FOSDEM 2026 pour mettre en avant MySQL avec un événement dédié "MySQL and friends". L'éditeur en profitait pour affimer que des fonctionnalités réservées aux versions payantes allaient bientôt rejoindre la version communautaire, notamment, les fonctions autour des vecteurs. Oracle parlait d'une nouvelle ère. Oracle cherchait à relancer les relations avec la communauté open source et rassurer sur l'avenir de mySQL. MariaDB a rapidement réagi : ""MariaDB a passé des années à livrer des innovations qui ont forcé Oracle à mettre à jour MySQL – des analyses en colonnes à la réplication avancée parallèle, en passant par le lancement de la recherche vectorielle native l'an dernier. Nous n'avons pas attendu le moment opportun pour ouvrir la porte à ces avancées ; nous les avons intégrées au cœur de notre serveur, car c'est ce que requiert une base de données open source moderne. Les utilisateurs MySQL ont désormais un choix clair : rester avec un éditeur qui n'innove que sous la contrainte, ou rejoindre MariaDB, qui se consacre à 100% à l'avenir. Puisque MariaDB devient l'option simple pour migrer depuis MySQL, sécuriser l'avenir de votre stack n'est plus qu'à un clic."
Il faut dire que la MySQL n'avait pas évolué depuis l'automne 2025 et qu'aucune communication claire n'avait été faite par Oracle sur l'avenir de la base de données. Il y a quelques jours, une lettre ouverte a été publiée pour demander à Oracle un changement de gouvernance : créer une gouvernance indépendante sous la forme d'une fondation pour reprendre en main MySQL et retrouver une stratégie claire. Les défis sont nombreux :
- une popularité en baisse constante
- manque de transparence sur le projet
- une version communautaire incomplète
- une partie des équipes transférées au cloud d'Oracle
La nouvelle gouvernance pourrait aider à relancer la confiance, définir une roadmap claire et transparence, unifier et fédérer l'écosystème.
Peu de chances que cette initiative puisse réellement influencer Oracle. Est-ce que l'éditeur veut réellement relancer MySQL et redonner une véritable dimension open source à la base de données ? Les annonces à la FOSDEM vont dans le bon sens mais le plus difficile reste à faire : concrétiser réellement ces annonces.

      <link>https://www.programmez.com/actualites/10-pratiques-de-codes-et-humaines-integrer-39039</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Parfois, il est bon de revenir aux fondamentaux et de se rappeler quelques concepts qui peuvent sembler simplistes, mais qui restent toujours utiles. 1 / On lit plus de code qu’on en écrit
Même si on essaie de faire simple et clair, quand on rouvre un code six mois plus tard, on se demande souvent : qu’est-ce que j’ai voulu faire ? Bref : * des noms de variables simples, mais répondant à une logique claire
* la lisibilité du code doit primer sur les performances pures Et gardez toujours en tête : serai-je capable de relire et comprendre ce code dans six mois ? 2 / Faire simple, c’est difficile Il est plus facile de faire compliqué que de faire simple. On ajoute des couches, des dépendances, des patterns dans tous les sens. Faire simple permet : * moins de risques d’erreurs
* un code plus facile à tester
* une meilleure maintenance sur le long terme 3 / Vous n’avez pas besoin de tout savoir, mais vous devez apprendre Un développeur ne sait pas tout. Mais il apprend. Il faut lire la documentation, décomposer les problèmes, expérimenter et apprendre en continu pour progresser. 4 / Le debug est une compétence Certains développeurs savent mieux debugger que d’autres. C’est un fait. Ils trouvent plus facilement les bugs, restent calmes et savent observer et comprendre le problème. Pour corriger un bug, il faut : * savoir le reproduire clairement
* modifier un élément à la fois
* lire et comprendre les logs, warnings et messages d’erreur 5 / Les frameworks ne changent pas les fondamentaux Maîtriser les fondamentaux est toujours un avantage. Cette maîtrise vous aidera à migrer plus sereinement d’une version à une autre, ou même à changer de technologie. Les frameworks évoluent. Les fondamentaux restent. 6 / Les problèmes de performances sont souvent des problèmes de conception Avant d’optimiser avec du caching, du tuning ou des micro-optimisations, regardez d’abord l’architecture et la conception du projet : * vos requêtes fonctionnent-elles correctement et sont-elles bien écrites ?
* le modèle de données est-il adapté ?
* pouvez-vous réduire les appels réseau inutiles ?
* certaines boucles peuvent-elles être optimisées ? Les gains les plus importants viennent souvent de la conception, pas des optimisations mineures. 7 / Écrire des tests Les tests permettent : * de refactoriser en toute sécurité
* de détecter plus rapidement les problèmes
* d’améliorer la qualité globale du code Les tests ne ralentissent pas le développement. Ils le sécurisent. 8 / La communication fait partie de notre métier Cela inclut notamment les et la documentation du code. Un code documenté est plus facile à comprendre, maintenir et faire évoluer dans le temps. Le code explique le « ». Les expliquent le « pourquoi ». 9 / Le burn-out est aussi un problème technique La pression des délais, les longues heures de développement ou le manque de vision peuvent conduire à un code de mauvaise qualité, difficile à maintenir. Un code de qualité nécessite : * du temps
* de la réflexion
* et des conditions de travail saines La qualité technique est aussi une question d’organisation. 10 / La progression n’est pas linéaire Développer, c’est traverser des périodes très productives, où tout fonctionne rapidement, et d’autres beaucoup plus difficiles : bugs incompréhensibles, code instable, spécifications floues. C’est normal. Dans ces moments-là, il faut revenir aux fondamentaux, reprendre le problème étape par étape et garder son calme. La progression se fait sur le long terme.

      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles What will change for llama.cpp, the open source project and the community? Technical focus Our long term vision We are super happy to announce that GGML, creators of Llama.cpp, are joining HF in order to keep future AI open. Georgi Gerganov and team are joining HF with the goal of scaling and supporting the community behind ggml and llama.cpp as Local AI continues to make exponential progress in the coming years.
We've been working with Georgi and team for quite some time (we even have awesome core contributors to llama.cpp like Son and Alek in the team already) so this has been a very natural process.
llama.cpp is the fundamental building block for local inference, and transformers is the fundamental building block for model definition, so this is basically a match made in heaven. What will change for llama.cpp, the open source project and the community? Not much – Georgi and team still dedicate 100% of their time maintaining llama.cpp and have full autonomy and leadership on the technical directions and the community.
HF is providing the project with long-term sustainable resources, improving the chances of the project to grow and thrive. The project will continue to be 100% open-source and community driven as it is now. Technical focus llama.cpp is the fundamental building block for]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[En 2022, alors que sa mère souffre de bouffées de chaleur liées à la ménopause, Thaddée Caron, fondateur d'Athana, cherche quelque chose pour la soulager. « Aucune solution non médicamenteuse satisfaisante n’existait sur le marché. Et en faisant des recherches, je me suis aperçu qu’un milliard de personnes dans le monde souffrait de bouffées de chaleur », souligne l'entrepreneur, qui, en voyant sa mère utiliser des sacs de petits pois surgelés pour se rafraichir, pense à la cryothérapie.
« J’ai mis au point un produit qui diffuse du froid à cinq degrés, sur les zones thermosensibles, comme la nuque ou la poitrine », précise-t-il. Une innovation qui a séduit plusieurs investisseurs dès 2023. « Nous avons fait une première levée de fonds d’1,2 millions d’euros pour construire deux lignes de production dans l’ouest de la France et embaucher quatre personnes », souligne l’entrepreneur, qui a réalisé 300 000 euros de chiffre d’affaires en 2025 et vise 1,5 million d'euros pour 2026.
« Devenir un dispositif médical »
Ses ambitions ont incité Alice Lhabouz à rejoindre l’aventure, sur le plateau de l’émission « Qui veut être mon associé ? », consacré aux inventeurs. L’investisseuse a ainsi accepté d’injecter 100 000 euros pour 5 % du capital de la société. Sans même négocier avec l’entrepreneur, accompagné et soutenu par Alain Toledano, oncologue-radiothérapeute influent.

      <title><![CDATA[No, Apple won’t drop USB-C from the iPhone 18]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066138/no-apple-wont-drop-usb-c-from-the-iphone-18.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Most iPhone fans are currently focused on the imminent launch of the iPhone 17e, which could be here in a matter of days. But one dubious rumor doing the rounds on social media right now concerns a flagship phone from the next generation. It’s just a shame that it’s almost certainly wrong.
This TikTok video, which at the time of writing has been viewed more than 17 million times, purports to show the charging port of the iPhone 18. (Or “iPhone18,” as it’s labelled by the clearly knowledgeable maker.) But rather than the USB-C port, which has been used on all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 15 in 2023, the animation shows something more akin to the MagSafe connector that appears on newer MacBooks. This video might look cool, but it’s not going to happen. TikTok The charging cable, which has a rather nice black braided cord, attaches via a magnetic connection. When it’s in place a green LED lights up on the charger head, and a small green lightning bolt is shown at the bottom of the previously blank phone screen. (Never mind that iPhones don’t behave like this; it’s the least of our worries.) It looks very similar to the MagSafe cable on my 2021 MacBook Pro, except with three pins instead of five and a chunkier body.
Now, the video doesn’t list its sources; we don’t get the usual “supply-chain sources” or “people with knowledge of the matter.” It’s just an animation. So in some ways it’s quite difficult to refute: where did this information come from? Who said this was likely? Is this simply a concept that an illustrator dreamed up, like this animation from the same channel showing possible iPhone 18 Pro colors?
Whatever the video’s intention, it’s getting major traction from viewers who think it’s real. A quick browse through a handful of the 9,700-odd reveals viewer after viewer complaining about Apple’s foolishness in doing this, or the impracticality of the design. A few appear to be Android fans mocking iPhone users for their misfortune. I couldn’t find any pointing out that this is extraordinarily unlikely to happen.
Because, as several commenters argue, it wouldn’t be a practical solution. It would disconnect very easily, and unlike on the MacBook, disconnecting easily isn’t necessary to protect it from a specific type of accident. It would annoy customers and accessories makers. And it could create problems with the EU, who mandated USB-C connectors on all smartphones sold in its territory.
What may have happened is that someone has got confused between MagSafe on the iPhone and MagSafe on the Mac. They’re both charging standards that use a magnetic connection to keep the charging points in place, but in most other respects they’re totally different. (For example, the phone’s magnetic connection is stronger so that it remains connected if you nudge the device, whereas the laptop is designed to detach if you trip on the wire.) The iPhone 17 already has the phone version of MagSafe, and the iPhone 18 will too, but that doesn’t mean it will have the Mac version as well. If nothing else, it would be enormously confusing.
Whereas the iPhone 17e is expected to be here in time for Apple’s “experience” on March 4, the first 18-series iPhones won’t arrive until September. And the actual iPhone 18, the cheaper baseline model, might not turn up until the following spring. So bookmark our iPhone 18 superguide to keep up with all the latest news and rumors.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066031/get-5-2nd-gen-airtags-for-the-price-of-4-with-this-rare-costco-deal.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple has a new AirTag for sale, but you’re probably not rushing out to buy one since you can still get the old ones for cheaper. But this deal may change your mind: Costco is throwing in a free AirTag when you buy a 4-pack for $100, essentially giving you five new AirTags for the price of 4, a savings of $45 on the price of buying five AirTags individually. (Note: You don’t need to be a member to take advantage of this deal.)
Apple’s 2nd-gen of AirTags have the same size as the previous model, and they look virtually the same. However, they have a louder speaker, which will make them easier to find even if your keys somehow ended up between couch cushions. Apple also upgraded the Bluetooth chip inside the tracker, expanding the range at which items can be located.
Also new is the U2 Ultra Wideband chip, which will make it possible to more precisely locate lost items, something that will definitely be handy. We’ve already tested the new AirTag 2 and gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, finding it to be a simple and efficient Bluetooth tracker that’s also super easy to set up and fairly inexpensive.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.programmez.com/actualites/rasbperry-pi-vs-esp32-vraies-questions-mauvaises-comparaisons-39038</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi vs ESP32 vs Arduino, cette question revient régulièrement quand on choisit la bonne plateforme pour son projet IoT. Comme nous le disons souvent quand nous comparons les platesformes, il faut comparer ce qui est comporable. Il ne faut pas opposer une Raspberry Pi 5 avec une ESP32. La Pi est une SBC, une Single Board Computer. Il s'agit donc d'un véritable micro-ordinateur sur une unique carte. Elle contient toute l'électronique (SoC, mémoire, vidéo, audio, stockage, réseau). Et une Pi 5 a besoin d'une alimentation puissante et d'un OS. L'ESP32 repose sur un firmware, qu'il est possible de changer.
L'autre différence est le form factor. La Pi 5 exige de la place et une dissipation thermique active pour les fortes charges.
La Pi 5 fait 8,5 cm sur 4,9 cm contre 5,5 cm sur 2,6 cm pour une ESP32 WROOM-32 (qui n'est pas le modèle le plus petit). L'ESP32 pourrait se comparer à la Pi Pico 2 avec 5,1 cm sur 2,1 cm. Nous ne tenons pas compte de la hauteur des headers.
L'équivalent d'une ESP32 côté Pi est donc la Pi Pico 2, aussi bien par le positionnement, le hardware et le form factor.
Petite comparaison : les specs Pi Pico 2 : un SoC RP235x + cœurs ARM, 520 Ko de SRAM, 4 Mo de stockage, 26 GPIO, UART / SPI / I2C, USB, réseau sans fil selon le modèle. De 6 à 9 € selon le modèle. - ESP32 Wroom32 : SoC ESP32, 512 Ko de RAM, 4 Mo de stockage, 34 GPIO, SPI / I2C / CAN / UART, WiFi + Bluetooth, env. 7-9 € Si vous êtes habitué(e) à coder avec Arduino, vous pouvez sans problème coder depuis l’Arduino IDE, les ESP sont parfaitement supportés. Vous pourrez utiliser peu ou prou les mêmes capteurs. Si vous cherchez une carte réactive avec des interruptions plus rapides, le Pi Pico 2 est souvent considéré comme meilleur. L’ESP32 propose plus de protocoleset de GPIO. Sur la partie connectivité sans fil, les deux cartes supportent le Wi-Fi et le Bluetooth, mais petit avantage à l’ESP32, car le réseau sans fil est une des fonctionnalités intégrées dès la conception. Et le support OTA (mise à jour over the air) peut être un avantage certain dans un contexte contraint ou industriel.
L’ESP32 est plus consommatrice, notamment en charge maximale. La Pi Pico 2 est plus économique. Si vous cherchez avant tout la basse consommation, la Pi sera sans doute la meilleure option.
Sur le modèle de développement, nous avons toujours apprécié la diversité de l’ESP32. Si vous voulez faire du MicroPython, vous devrez flasher le bon firmware. Catégorie actualité: Hardware Raspberry pi, ESP32 Image actualité AMP:]]></description>

      <link>https://linuxfr.org/news/physiocab-un-logiciel-libre-de-gestion-pour-kinesitherapeutes</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Physiocab est un logiciel libre de gestion de cabinet de kinésithérapie, développé sous licence Affero GPL 3.0 et hébergé sur Codeberg. Le projet est porté par la société Allium SAS, dans le cadre de la plateforme communautaire Kalinka, dédiée aux kinésithérapeutes francophones.
Le projet vient de passer en beta publique (v0.9) et cherche des testeurs et contributeurs.
Pourquoi un logiciel libre pour les kinés ? Le secteur de la santé libérale souffre d'une offre logicielle dominée par des solutions propriétaires onéreuses, souvent opaques sur le traitement des données de santé. Physiocab propose une alternative : un code auditable, des données stockées localement sous la responsabilité du praticien. lien nᵒ 1 : La page de présentation du projet
lien nᵒ 2 : Le dépôt codeberg
lien nᵒ 3 : PeerJs (MIT) Fonctionnalités
La beta couvre déjà un large périmètre fonctionnel :
Planning hebdomadaire en drag &amp; drop, avec export PDF et gestion des semaines exceptionnelles, particulièrement orienté vers les kinés intervenant en multi-établissements.
Bilans Diagnostiques Kinésithérapiques (BDK) avec tests standardisés (TUG, Tinetti, Handgrip, EVA, évaluation du risque de chute…), export de PDF et historique comparatif.
Suivi des séances avec de multiples exercices structurés (équilibre, force, endurance, mobilisation), chronométrage automatique et calcul de progression.
Application tablette en PWA : fonctionne hors connexion grâce à un Service Worker, s'installe sans passer par un store, interface optimisée tactile.
Stack technique
Backend : Python 3.10+
L'application est multi-plateforme côté client (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). La communication entre l'appli de bureau et l'appli PWA se fait de manière directe via PeerJs. Cette méthode ne nécessite pas de préparation contraignante comme l'ouverture de ports.
Les données sont stockées localement, ce qui implique que le praticien reste maître de ses sauvegardes et de sa conformité RGPD.
Le logiciel a été testé par un kinésithérapeute en situation réelle plusieurs jours d'affilée.
Modèle économique
L'utilisation est gratuite, sans limite dans le temps et sans frais cachés, la licence Affero GPL 3.0 en étant la garantie. Un support payant sur devis est proposé pour les praticiens souhaitant une installation assistée, une formation à distance, des développements sur mesure ou un audit de sécurité.

      <link>https://www.programmez.com/actualites/python-environnements-extension-pour-unifier-les-environnements-python-sur-visual-studio-code-39036</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Pour simplifier et unifier l'environnement de développement Python sur Visual Studio Code, on dispose de la nouvelle extension Python Environnements. Il doit unifier le modèle de développement, gérer les environnements et les workflows, gérer les interpréteurs et les packages. Jusqu'é présent, l'expérience Python était fragmenté à travers les différents outils (venv, conda, pyenv, etc.). Après plus d'un an d'ajustements et de développement, l'extension est disponible. A terme, tous les flux Python migreront vers l'extension Environnements. Il est possible d'activer dès maintenant : python.useEnvsExtension. L'extension fonctionne en parallèle de l'extension Python et aucune configuration particulière n'est requise : vous ouvrez un fichier Python et l'environnement utilisé est automatiquement détecté. Les environnements supportés sont : venv
conda
pyenv
poetry
pipenv
System Python installs La découverte est assurée par PET (Python Environment Tool), un outil de scan codé en Rust. Si vous utilisez uv, l'extension va automatiquement créer un environnement venv et installer les paquets nécessaires. Pour le moment, il n'est pas possible de créer rapidement des projets sur tous les environnements, seuls venv et conda sont supportés. Sans doute que les autres le seront dans les prochaines versions. Mauvaise nouvelle : l'extension fonctionne UNIQUEMENT sur Windows x64 et Windows ARM et l'édition Web ! Il faut Python soit installé.
Pour le moment, les retours sont plutôt mauvais : extension difficile à utiliser, perte de temps pour créer les environnements depuis Pylance, etc. Et les mises à jour se succèdent. Heureusement que l'extension est officiellement en preview.

IBM Research and UC Berkeley collaborated to study how agentic LLM systems break in real-world IT automation, for tasks involving incident triage, logs/metrics queries, and Kubernetes actions in long-horizon tool loops.
Benchmarks typically reduce performance to a single number, telling you whether an agent failed but never why. To solve this black-box problem, we applied MAST (Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy), an emerging practice for diagnosing agentic reliability ). By leveraging MAST to analyze ITBench—the industry benchmark for SRE, Se]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Justin Wheeler writes in Fedora
Magazine that Fedora is now available in Syria once again:
Last week, the Fedora Infrastructure Team lifted
the IP range block on IP addresses in Syria. This action restores
download access to Fedora Linux deliverables, such as ISOs. It also
restores access from Syria to Fedora Linux RPM repositories, the
Fedora Account System, and Fedora build systems. Users can now access
the various applications and services that make up the Fedora
Project. This change follows a recent update to the Fedora Export
Control Policy. Today, anyone connecting to the public Internet from
Syria should once again be able to access Fedora.
[...] Opening the firewall to Syria took seconds. However, months of
conversations and hidden work occurred behind the scenes to make this
happen.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The Asahi Linux project, which is working to implement support for Linux on
Apple CPUs, has published a detailed 6.19
progress report. We've made incredible progress upstreaming patches over the past 12 months. Our patch set has shrunk from 1232 patches with 6.13.8, to 858 as of 6.18.8. Our total delta in terms of lines of code has also shrunk, from 95,000 lines to 83,000 lines for the same kernel versions. Hmm, a 15% reduction in lines of code for a 30% reduction in patches seems a bit wrong… Not all patches are created equal. Some of the upstreamed patches have been small fixes, others have been thousands of lines. All of them, however, pale in comparison to the GPU driver. The GPU driver is 21,000 lines by itself, discounting the downstream Rust abstractions we are still carrying. It is almost double the size of the DCP driver and thrice the size of the ISP/webcam driver, its two closest rivals. And upstreaming work has now begun.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple’s low-cost MacBook has been a long time coming, but it now seems clear that we can expect it to be launched in the first week of March.
Apple has a special event taking place on March 4, but a subsequent report says that this will not include a keynote presentation. Instead, it says we can expect a series of press releases along the lines of the ones we saw back in 2024 …

      <description><![CDATA[Apple previously accused Qualcomm of “double-dipping” as a result of the company’s policies over selling radio chips for use in iPhones. The Cupertino company had also objected to Qualcomm charging a percentage of the price of an iPhone rather than a fixed fee per chip.
Apple withdrew its claims back in 2024, but an independent class-action lawsuit was still being pursued on behalf of iPhone owners. This lawsuit has now been abandoned …

      <description><![CDATA[Comcast, Classiq et AMD mènent des tests pour améliorer le trafic Internet en utilisant des algorithmes quantiques pour renforcer la résistance du routage réseau. "L’essai conjoint s’est concentré sur un défi clé de la conception des réseaux : identifier des chemins de secours indépendants pour les nœuds du réseau lors des opérations de maintenance ou de modifications. L’objectif était de garantir que, si un site est mis hors ligne et que soudainement, un deuxième tombe en panne, le trafic puisse être redirigé sans interruption ni dégradation du service pour les clients. Pour y parvenir, les opérateurs doivent identifier des chemins de secours distincts, rapides et capables de résister à des pannes simultanées, tout en minimisant la latence. Cette tâche devient de plus en plus complexe à mesure que le réseau s’étend." explique l'annonce. Le schéma présente le design et l'implémentation du flux et de l'algo quantique sur la plateforme Classiq. L’expérimentation a combiné des techniques de calcul quantique et des méthodes classiques haute performance afin d’évaluer la capacité des algorithmes quantiques à identifier, en temps réel, des chemins de secours dans des scénarios de gestion des changements. Elle a été menée à la fois sur du matériel quantique et dans des environnements de simulation accélérés utilisant des GPU AMD Instinct, afin d’atteindre une capacité de calcul (à l’échelle des qubits) encore hors de portée du matériel quantique seul.
« L’avenir du calcul repose sur la convergence entre le classique et le quantique », explique Madhu Rangarajan, vice-président corporate en charge des produits Compute et Enterprise AI chez AMD. « En tant qu’acteur du calcul haute performance, nous cherchons à comprendre nos technologies peuvent accompagner l’émergence du quantique. Cette collaboration montre un cas concret où la simulation accélérée et l’exécution quantique sont combinées pour répondre à un enjeu opérationnel réel dans les réseaux. »

They have power stations that hold enough energy to run entire houses for days or weeks at a time. But recently they have been bringing that same battery know-how to a smaller and more consumer-friendly form factor. They have expanded their lineup with the new Rapid Mag power bank product line. The star of the show is their new MagSafe power bank that combines Qi2.2 wireless charging, a built-in USB-C cable, and an integrated kickstand into a slim 10,000mAh design. Here is why I think this is worth your consideration.

      <link>https://goodtech.info/vim-9-2-release-support-wayland-standard-xdg/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[34 ans après sa première version, Vim prouve qu’il reste un pilier incontournable de l’écosystème open source. Le projet a publié le vendredi 13 février 2026 la version 9.2 de son célèbre éditeur de texte. Il s’agit de la première mise à jour majeure depuis janvier 2024, marquant une étape importante dans la continuité du projet après le décès de son créateur Bram Moolenaar en 2023. Cette version n’est pas qu’une simple correction de bugs, car elle apporte des fonctionnalités de modernité réclamées de longue date par la communauté. Tour d’horizon !
Un support natif de Wayland et des dossiers plus propres
La grande nouveauté de cette version est l’arrivée du support expérimental de Wayland. Vous pouvez désormais profiter de l’intégration native du presse-papiers système sans avoir besoin de plugins tiers, car Vim communique directement avec les serveurs d’affichage modernes de Linux.
Parallèlement, Vim 9.2 adopte enfin la spécification XDG Base Directory. Si vous en avez assez de voir votre dossier personnel encombré par les fichiers .vimrc et .vim, vous allez apprécier ce changement, car l’éditeur peut désormais stocker sa configuration dans $HOME/.config/vim. C’est un pas de géant vers des environnements Linux plus standardisés et ordonnés.

      <description><![CDATA[Checkmarx annonce que son Developer Assist supporte l'IDE Kiro, pour l'étendre la sécurité applicative directement dans l'enviornnement. Cette intégration permet à ces derniers d'identifier et de résoudre les problèmes de sécurité au fil de l'écriture du code, sans quitter leur IDE ni dépendre de scans en aval dans la chaîne CI/CD.
En utilisant l’extension IDE officielle de Checkmarx, les développeurs peuvent activer Developer Assist dans Kiro en quelques étapes seulement, sans configuration lourde. La prise en charge d’autres flux de développement, y compris via la ligne de commande, sera bientôt disponible. Une fois authentifié, Developer Assist analyse automatiquement le code source et les dépendances de l’espace de travail actif, appliquant les politiques existantes de Checkmarx One. Aucune configuration spécifique à Kiro, API propriétaire ou intégration expérimentale n’est nécessaire. Developer Assist est disponible sur Cursor, Visual Studio Code et Windsurf.

      <description><![CDATA[concilier agents IA et sites web et la manière dont les pages web pourraient interagir, travailler avec les agents ? WebMCP veut fournir une méthode standard pour définir les actions des agents sur un site web, sur une page web sans pénaliser au bon fonctionnement du site web. "Vous indiquez aux agents et où interagir avec votre site, qu'il s'agisse de réserver un vol, de soumettre une demande d'assistance ou de naviguer dans des données complexes. Ce canal de communication direct élimine toute ambiguïté et permet des flux de travail plus rapides et plus efficaces pour les agents." expliquer Google. WebMCP preview repose sur 2 API :
- API déclarative : Permet d’effectuer des actions standard définies directement dans les formulaires HTML. - API impérative : Permet d’effectuer des interactions plus complexes et dynamiques nécessitant l’exécution de JavaScript. C'est une interface proposé en preview par Google et accessible dans Chrome. Ces API forment un "pont" rendant votre site web "agent ready" et permet de créer des flux agentiques que se veulent plus fiables qu'en passant par du DOM. Ces API sont JavaScript. Pour le moment, la spécification est en cours de rédaction. Elle ne dépend pas de W3C et n'est pas un standard du consortium.

The Document Foundation (TDF) intensifie sa critique contre Microsoft, accusant le géant américain de privilégier ses intérêts commerciaux au détriment de l’interopérabilité.
[Les Numeriques] “Le vibe coding tue l'open-source”: quand l'IA dévore ce qui la nourrit, les économistes sonnent l'alerte Aymeric Geoffre-Rouland, le lundi 9 février 2026.
Quand un développeur demande à Claude ou ChatGPT d’écrire du code, l’IA pioche dans des milliers de bibliothèques libres sans que l’humain ne lise jamais leur documentation. Résultat: les mainteneurs de ces projets open-source, qui vivent de la visibilité générée par les visites et les interactions, voient leur audience s’effondrer. Une étude économique chiffre ce paradoxe: l’IA qui accélère le développement logiciel asphyxie l’écosystème qui le rend possible.

Combien de copies de vos coordonnées existent actuellement ? Qui les détient ? sont-elles utilisées ? Nous avons perdu le contrôle de nos données, ou plutôt, nous ne l’avons jamais eu. Les géants de la technologie contrôlent des milliards de bases de données de contacts. Les gouvernements développent des identités numériques centralisées (EUDI Wallet EU en 2026). Nous subissons : violations de données, spam, absence totale de contrôle.
La solution : architecture P2P + E2EE
Meishi renverse le paradigme. Lorsque vous mettez à jour votre profil numérique, tous vos contacts reçoivent automatiquement la mise à jour. Vous gardez le contrôle : vous accordez, modifiez ou révoquez l’accès quand vous le souhaitez.
Stack technique
P2P + E2EE avec Signal Protocol pour les données privées
Zero-knowledge : serveurs sans accès aux données privées
Open source (moteur de synchronisation + client iOS/Android)
Hybride : client-serveur uniquement pour les données publiques, P2P pour le reste]]></description>

      <link>https://www.programmez.com/actualites/net-11-preview-1-nouvelles-librairies-peu-de-changements-dans-c-39026</link>
      <description><![CDATA[.Net 10 a été distribuée en novembre 2025. La version 11 est désormais disponible en preview 1. Comme à chaque fois, de nombreuses évolutions sont attendues. L'ensemble des frameworks et des langages sont concernées : C#, F#, ASP.Net Core, Blazor, MAUI, le compilateur Jit, le support de CoreCLR dans WebAssembly, meilleure compression / décompression avec Zstandard. Sur la partie librairie, retenons déjà les évolutions suivantes :
- Zstandard est natif à .Net pour la compression. La librairie promet une nette amélioration des performances :
// Compress data using ZstandardStream
using var compressStream = new ZstandardStream(outputStream, CompressionMode.Compress);
await inputStream.CopyToAsync(compressStream); // Decompress data
using var decompressStream = new ZstandardStream(inputStream, CompressionMode.Decompress);
await decompressStream.CopyToAsync(outputStream);
- BFloat16 intègre par défaut toutes les interfaces standards pour le numérique
- amélioration de TimeZone
Note de version sur les librairies : https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/11.0/preview/preview1/libraries.md
Sur la partie runtime, il faut s'attendre à de bonnes nouvelles :
- Runtime async : une nouvelle fonction majeure du runtime et méthodes asynchrones pour améliorer les performances. CoreCLR supporte RuntimeAsync par défaut, idem pour Native AOT
- CoreCLR est supporté dans WebAssembly. Il n'est pas encore disponible en preview 1.
- diverses améliorations de performances sur le JIT - meilleur support de RISC-V
Sur C#, pour le moment, peu de nouveautés annoncées. Deux nouvelles fonctions sont attendues : arguments pour les expresssions Collection et support Extended layout. .Net 11 n'introduira aucune nouvelle fonctionnalité pour Visual Basic. Sur ASP.Net Core et Blazor, les développeurs vont avoir beaucoup de nouveautés : EnvironmentBoundary, nouveau composant Label dans les formulaires Blazor, nouveau composant DisplayName, navigation relative Uri, support "propre" des éléments MathML dans un rendu interactif. Tous les détails dans la note de version : https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/11.0/preview/preview1/aspnetcore.md
La génération de source XAML est par défaut pour les applications .Net MAUI, cela doit permettre un build plus rapide et un debug plus performant. Sur Android, CoreCLR devient le runtime par défaut. Sur Container Images et Winfows Forms, pas de nouveautés annoncées.

Suite à la dépêche de décembre 2024 concernant l’organisation de la course de robots mobiles, voici quelques retours sur cet événement : malgré plusieurs annulations d’écoles survenues quelques semaines avant la compétition, la course a tout de même pu avoir lieu.
Environ quinze participants ont pris part à la compétition. Parmi les robots engagés, on comptait un robot DIY piloté par un microcontrôleur ESP32, aux côtés de plusieurs robots basé sur Raspberry Pi, offrant ainsi une belle diversité technologique.

      <link>https://linuxfr.org/news/libreoffice-26-2-markdown-accessibilite-et-plein-d-autres-nouveautes-et-ameliorations</link>
      <description><![CDATA[En février, il y a la corvée commerciale de la Saint-Valentin et les réjouissances intellectuelles consécutives à la sortie d’une nouvelle version de la suite bureautique LibreOffice. C’est, bien évidemment, sur LibreOffice 26.2 que l’on va se pencher. Au menu, du très visible, comme les boites de dialogues, du très attendu comme la prise en compte du Markdown ou du moins visible comme le travail sur l’accessibilité.
Il va de soi que les notes de version sont plus exhaustives et qu’il ne s’agit ici que d’une sélection. lien nᵒ 1 : Notes de version Sommaire
L’accessibilité
Support du Markdown
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Writer
Calc
En vrac
Pour finir
Avant de commencer : toutes les captures d’écran ont été faites, volontairement, sur une interface très personnalisée.
L’accessibilité
L’accessibilité de la suite bureautique est un important chantier pour lequel une personne a été recrutée en 2023 (en). Cette version-ci a fait l’objet d’améliorations sensibles. Parallèlement, Sophie Gautier, coordinatrice de The Document Foundation1 (Foundation coordinator) est en train de monter un groupe de travail qui a pour objectif la publication d’un rapport de conformité en matière d’accessibilité pour répondre à la norme européenne EN 301 549 (en) d’accessiblité numérique. La langue de travail de ce groupe est l’anglais.
Concernant les améliorations de cette version :
la boite de dialogue « Vérifier les mises à jour », Aide &gt; Vérifier les mises à jour… est devenue accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
les fonctions d’accessibilité des aperçus des bordures, onglet « Bordures » des boites de dialogue, ont été revues afin qu’elles ne perturbent plus les dispositifs d’assistance ;
sur Linux : la boite de dialogue Outils&gt; Orthographe est annoncée correctement par le lecteur d’écran ;
quand on supprimait la sélection accessible, le curseur se déplaçait automatiquement au début du texte, ce comportement perturbant est supprimé ;
dans Writer, les fautes d’orthographe ne sont plus signalées par les dispositifs d’assistance si la vérification orthographique n’est pas activée ;
l’accessibilité au clavier de la boite de dialogue des extensions : Outils &gt; Extensions est accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
et enfin, il est possible de naviguer entre les onglets verticaux avec des raccourcis clavier.
Support du Markdown
Le Markdown est devenu le format de balisage léger standard « de fait ». Et c’est celui supporté par LinuxFR. Son support a été introduit dans cette version, c’est un des formats d’enregistrement qui s’est ajouté à la série des autres formats de la suite, pas un format d’export. Pour l’utiliser pour vos sites, passant pour LinuxFR, vous devrez :
soit ouvrir le fichier .md dans un éditeur de texte, n’importe lequel, même Mousepad fait l’affaire par exemple, et copier-coller ensuite le tout à partir de l’éditeur de texte là où vous le voulez ;
soit, si cela est possible, importer le fichier .md dans ce qui vous sert pour gérer le site comme le fait par exemple l’extension ODT2SPIP pour le système de gestion de contenu SPIP qui permet de créer une nouvelle page dans SPIP avec un fichier.ODT. ça marche avec LinuxFR ? Plutôt bien. Les styles de caractère Accentuation (ici en italiques) et Accentuation forte (ici gras) sont bien reconnu ainsi que Texte source pour « télétype », les indications in-texte encadrées de l’accent grave U+0060. Les styles de paragraphes :
Bloc de citation (paragraphes de citation précédés d’une ligne blanche et du signe « &gt; » dans la saisie de contenu sur LinuxFR) ;
Contenu de tableau ;
Corps de texte ;
Liste, par contre la numérotation des listes ordonnée ne semble pas bien fonctionner, il faut saisir les numéros à la main ;
Texte préformaté pour écrire des blocs de code ;
Titre 1, Titre 2, Titre 3 et Titre de tableau.
Les tableaux sont bien repris ainsi que les liens insérés via l’insertion d’hyperliens.
Ce qui ne semble pas fonctionner du tout : ce sont les notes, elles disparaissent corps et biens. C’est peut-être dû au passage dans l’éditeur de texte qui transforme un peu le document. Et, évidemment, il faut rajouter les images avec la syntaxe LinuxFR.
La version de Mardown de LibreOffice est CommonMark (en) et la bibliothèque utilisée est MD4C avec quelques extensions prises en charge par cette bibliothèque (cf ce rapport de bug (en) et ses réponses), pour en savoir plus, voir cette note (en) du blog de The Document Foundation.
Petite remarque, si vous utilisez un LibreOffice 25.8, vous avez peut-être pu constater qu’il était question d’enregistrement au format .md, cette information a été ajoutée trop précocement car la version 25.8 ne gère pas le Markdown.
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Les boites de dialogue, notamment de styles et de formats, ont beaucoup changé. Longtemps elles se sont affichées avec une présentation par onglets en haut et le contenu dessous.
Puis il y a une période de transition en 2025 qui a fait grincer une collection complète de dents où on avait, selon l’endroit où on était, soit des onglets soit une navigation par menu latéral. Cette dernière avait un gros défaut : par exemple pour la configuration des styles dans Writer il fallait descendre tout en bas pour accéder aux options qui étaient cachées. Et il n’y avait pas de barre de défilement pour aller plus vite.
LibreOffice 26.2 voit ces défauts corrigés : les boites de dialogue sont harmonisées dans toute la suite et leur menu latéral, toujours sans barre de défilement qui s’avère finalement inutile, montre clairement tous les types de paramètres auxquels on peut accéder. Et, comme on peut le voir, LibreOffice a intégré une meilleure prise en charge des systèmes d’écritures asiatiques et complexes en affichant deux colonnes, une pour les polices occidentales, ou pour les polices asiatiques ou complexes. Une personne a également été recrutée en 2023 (en) pour travailler sur le support des systèmes d’écriture de droite à gauche (RTL) et complexes (CTL). Si toutefois, vous préférez revenir à l’affichage avec les onglets, il suffit d’aller dans le menu Outils &gt; Options &gt; Apparenceau niveau de « Boites de dialogue » et cocher l’option Horizontal en haut. Il faut savoir que les onglets en haut ne s’affichent que sur une seule ligne et qu’il faudra donc naviguer avec les flèches quand il y a de nombreuses options. Writer
Il y a un certain nombre d’amélioration autour de la compatibilité avec le format DOCX : séparation de tableaux flottants en plusieurs tableaux, suppression de la numérotation des notes de bas de page à l’ouverture d’un fichier DOCX, etc.
On relèvera deux nouvelles options d’alignement des paragraphes : « Début » et « Fin ». Si vous utilisez l’alphabet latin, vous ne verrez aucune différence avec les deux options « Forcer à gauche/en haut » et « Forcer à droite/en bas ». Elles ont été développées pour réutiliser plus facilement les styles entre les divers systèmes d’écriture. Pour continuer sur la lancée du travail pour la prise en compte des systèmes d’écriture dont le fonctionnement est différent de celui de l’alphabet latin, il est possible de changer la direction du texte : de gauche à droite ou de droite à gauche en cours de travail. Cela peut se paramétrer dans les styles. Calc
Un gros travail sur les performances a été fait : vitesse de défilement, rapidité des classeurs avec de nombreuses formes et du rejet des modifications. On voit apparaître de nouvelles options de tri (Données &gt;Trier) qui dépendent de la « locale » (langue définie dans les Options de LibreOffice). On peut ainsi déterminer quel caractère est utilisé comme séparateur de décimal pour le tri naturel. On peut relever aussi une avancée ergonomique qui va plaire à toutes celles et ceux qui utilisent les matrices, on peut maintenant modifier les formules matricielles avec la combinaison de touches : F2 + ↑ Maj + Ctrl + Entrée, il n’est plus nécessaire de modifier la formule elle-même.
Et aussi : si vous utilisez (pourquoi diable ?) le format d’enregistrement XLSX, c’est le format EXCEL2010+ qui est le format par défaut, il change de nom pour devenir « Classeur Excel 2010-365 ».2
En vrac
Base est devenu complètement multi-utilisateur, TDF a, d’ailleurs, recruté une personne pour travailler sur l’application.
Concernant les diagrammes (ou chart) : dans le Volet latéral, quand le graphique est en mode modification et que l’on va, au niveau de « Couleurs », sur la palette, on a une prévisualisation en direct dans le diagramme ce qui permet de tester le choix de couleurs plus facilement.
Les polices embarquées dont la licence ne permettait pas l’édition étaient jusqu’à présent ignorées et remplacées à l’affichage, ni vu, ni connu par une fonte de substitution. Ce défaut a été corrigé.
L’export PDF gère les liens avec les documents externes : Fichier &gt; Exporter au format PDF &gt; Liens. Les dictionnaires hongrois, mongol et portugais du Portugal ont été mis à jour ainsi que les règles de césure de la langue hongroise.
JSON, pour JavaScript Object Notation, est un format standard utilisé pour représenter des données structurées. Il est utilisé notamment pour échanger les informations entre un navigateur et un serveur. C’est, par exemple, le format de sauvegarde des marques-pages de Firefox ou de certains fichiers d’archives de Mastodon. Les documents XML et JSON génériques avec des plages pouvant être liées sont maintenant automatiquement mappés à des feuilles dans Calc. Une plage pouvant être liée est une section d’un document contenant des enregistrements tabulaires. Lorsqu’un document contient plusieurs plages pouvant être liées, chaque plage est mappée à une seule feuille3.
Et si vous avez envie de vous amuser avec les fonctions expérimentales (à activer dansOutils &gt; Options &gt; LibreOffice &gt; Avancé), vous pouvez jouer avec la nouvelle de boite de dialogue « Gestion des macros ».
Pour finir
Cette dépêche a, bien, évidemment, été rédigée avec LibreOffice et, cette fois-ci dans un fichier enregistré en Markdown. Les seules balises que j’ai dû entrer à la main sont celles des images. Kate a l’air de modifier le fichier et, quand je réouvre le .md dans LibreOffice, il y a des styles qui ont sauté mais la mise en forme reste visuellement la même. Kate rajoute aussi des barres obliques devant les « &gt; », aux crochets [ ] et même à certains hyperliens (images). Il y a peut-être des éditeurs de texte plus adaptés ou des réglages à faire.
J’ai rédigé cette dépêche en même temps qu’un article sur LibreOffice 26.2 pour mon site. Si l’article n’est pas vraiment dupliqué, il n’est pas étonnant d’y trouver des morceaux ici. Que tout cela ne nous empêche d’adresser tous nos remerciements à celles et ceux qui font de LibreOffice une suite bureautique si agréable à utiliser et si performante.
Post-scriptum : si vous voulez savoir modifier les couleurs de l’interface comme sur les captures d’écran, ça peut s’envisager, demandez gentiment, avec un peu de chance.
The Document Foundation ou TDF est la fondation de droit allemand qui pilote le projet LibreOffice. Il y a deux formats OOXML différents et donc deux formats XLSX différents, la version 2007 et la version actuelle depuis 2010. S’il vous est vraiment nécessaire d’enregistrer au format XLSX, il faut utiliser la version de 2010. Notes de version.

C’est, par exemple, le format de sauvegarde des marques-pages de Firefox ou de certains fichiers d’archives de Mastodon. Les documents XML et JSON génériques avec des plages pouvant être liées sont maintenant automatiquement mappés à des feuilles dans Calc. Une plage pouvant être liée est une section d’un document contenant des enregistrements tabulaires. Lorsqu’un document contient plusieurs plages pouvant être liées, chaque plage est mappée à une seule feuille3.
Et si vous avez envie de vous amuser avec les fonctions expérimentales (à activer dansOutils &gt; Options &gt; LibreOffice &gt; Avancé), vous pouvez jouer avec la nouvelle de boite de dialogue « Gestion des macros ».
Pour finir
Cette dépêche a, bien, évidemment, été rédigée avec LibreOffice et, cette fois-ci dans un fichier enregistré en Markdown. Les seules balises que j’ai dû entrer à la main sont celles des images. Kate a l’air de modifier le fichier et, quand je réouvre le .md dans LibreOffice, il y a des styles qui ont sauté mais la mise en forme reste visuellement la même. Kate rajoute aussi des barres obliques devant les « &gt; », aux crochets [ ] et même à certains hyperliens (images). Il y a peut-être des éditeurs de texte plus adaptés ou des réglages à faire.
J’ai rédigé cette dépêche en même temps qu’un article sur LibreOffice 26.2 pour mon site. Si l’article n’est pas vraiment dupliqué, il n’est pas étonnant d’y trouver des morceaux ici. Que tout cela ne nous empêche d’adresser tous nos remerciements à celles et ceux qui font de LibreOffice une suite bureautique si agréable à utiliser et si performante.
Post-scriptum : si vous voulez savoir modifier les couleurs de l’interface comme sur les captures d’écran, ça peut s’envisager, demandez gentiment, avec un peu de chance.
The Document Foundation ou TDF est la fondation de droit allemand qui pilote le projet LibreOffice. Il y a deux formats OOXML différents et donc deux formats XLSX différents, la version 2007 et la version actuelle depuis 2010. S’il vous est vraiment nécessaire d’enregistrer au format XLSX, il faut utiliser la version de 2010. Notes de version.

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/openenv-turing</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles What Is OpenEnv? The Calendar Gym: A Production-Grade Benchmark What We Learned Looking Ahead Appendix: Common error cases in tool use Specific error cases found in the wild AI agents often perform impressively in controlled research settings, yet struggle when deployed in real-world systems where they must reason across multiple steps, interact with real tools and APIs, operate under partial information, and recover from errors in stateful, permissioned environments—highlighting a persistent gap between research success and production reliability.
OpenEnv is an open-source framework from Meta and Hugging Face designed to address this challenge by standardizing how agents interact with real environments. As part of this collaboration, Turing contributed a production-grade calendar management environment to study tool-using agents under realistic constraints such as access control, temporal reasoning, and multi-agent coordination.
In this post, we explore how OpenEnv works in practice, why calendars serve as a powerful benchmark for real-world agent evaluation, and what our findings reveal about the current limitations of tool-using agents. What Is OpenEnv? OpenEnv is a framework for evaluating AI agents against real systems rather than simulations. It provides a standardized way to connect agents to real tools and]]></description>

      <link>https://linuxfr.org/news/l-anssi-revise-sa-doctrine-vis-a-vis-du-logiciel-libre</link>
      <description><![CDATA[L’ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) vient de publier une mise à jour substantielle de sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre. L’agence confirme que le logiciel libre et la transparence sont essentiels à la sécurité des systèmes d’information. Elle assume sa contribution au libre et la publication de logiciels sous licence libre.
Cette posture très favorable au logiciel libre et open source est une belle avancée et un signal fort. Jusque-là, la posture de l’ANSSI était beaucoup plus floue et sa contribution à des projets libres et open source pouvait même apparaitre en contradiction avec sa doctrine. J’avais l’impression que les collaborateurs de l’ANSSI qui le faisaient reprenaient à leur compte le dicton « Pour vivre heureux, vivons cachés ».
La politique de l’agence est désormais claire : l’ANSSI contribue, l’ANSSI publie, l’ANSSI a une stratégie pragmatique qui peut l’amener à s’engager ou non sur le long terme en fonction de la finalité de l’outil et des motivations de l’ANSSI.
Détail qui a son importance, l’ANSSI indique privilégier, sauf exception justifiée, la licence Apache v2.0 pour les projets qu’elle publie. Je suis ravi de voir ce service privilégier une licence mondialement connue à une licence franco-française ou européenne (elles ont le don de doucher nombre de velléités d’utilisation et de contribution). lien nᵒ 1 : L’ANSSI met à jour sa politique open source (9 février 2026)

      <description><![CDATA[L’association Drupal France &amp; Francophonie organise la 13ème édition du Drupalcamp les 9, 10 et 11 avril 2026 au campus Universitaire Grenoble Alpes de Grenoble (France, Isère 38). Drupal est « un système de gestion de contenu (CMS) libre et open-source publié sous la licence publique générale GNU et écrit en PHP ».
Après Rennes en 2024, puis un Barcamp à Perpignan en 2025, cette année 2026 nous emmène au pied des montagnes à Grenoble pour un format de 3 jours de rencontres, soit deux journées de conférences les jeudi et vendredi. La journée du samedi est réservée à la contribution.
Des moments d’ateliers et micro-formation sont également au programme, pour faire de cet évènement une réussite d’un point de vue communauté autour du projet Open Source Drupal.
Le Drupalcamp Grenoble c’est la rencontre de la communauté francophone autour du logiciel libre Drupal. Ouvert à toutes et tous, les rencontres, conférences et ateliers permettent d’adresser à un public toujours plus large des sujets et thématiques diversifiées.
Notre objectif principal est de rendre la création de sites plus simple et la gestion des contenus plus intuitive pour tous. Comme de fédérer les utilisateurs et professionnels qui utilisent Drupal au quotidien.
Du simple curieux au développeur expert, tous ceux qui s’intéressent à Drupal et aux logiciels libres pourront participer à cette manifestation rythmée par :
des conférences (jeudi 9 et vendredi 10 avril), données par des professionnels reconnus et des membres de la communauté Drupal au cours desquels des thématiques nouvelles seront explorées,
des sessions de découverte étayées par des démonstrations à l’intention d’un public plus néophyte,
une journée de formation gratuite (Drupal in a Day) dédiée à l’initiation pour que les curieux puissent se lancer dans la création de leur premier site (sur inscription)
des moments de réseautage et de convivialité avec, notamment, la très attendue soirée communautaire !
Informations pratiques : Campus Universitaire Grenoble Alpes qui se situe à Saint-Martin d'Hères

Running Existing Workflows Run the Glaive Code Assistant workflow Get started SyGra 2.0.0 introduces Studio, an interactive environment that turns synthetic data generation into a transparent, visual craft. Instead of juggling YAML files and terminals, you compose flows directly on the canvas, preview datasets before committing, tune prompts with inline variable hints, and watch executions stream live—all from a single pane. Under the hood it’s the same platform, so everything you do visually generates the corresponding SyGra compatible graph config and task executor scripts. What Studio lets you do Configure and validate models with guided forms (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, Vertex, Bedrock, vLLM, custom endpoints).
Connect Hugging Face, file-system, or ServiceNow data sources and preview rows before execution.
Configure nodes by selecting models, writing prompts (with auto-suggested variables), and defining outputs or structured schemas.
Design downstream outputs using shared state variables and Pydantic-powered mappings.]]></description>

      <link>https://iotbusinessnews.com/2026/02/04/iot-data-collection-in-atex-environments/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Key Insights (AI-assisted):
Tightening integration between intrinsically safe hardware and modern connectivity is shifting hazardous-area IoT from niche pilots to scalable deployments. As ATEX smartphones gain full cellular, GNSS, and sensor stacks, the bottleneck moves from device capability to interoperability with SCADA, MDM, and line-of-business applications. This forces OT and IT teams to converge architectures and security models, particularly on private LTE/5G. The trend reflects a broader move toward real-time, worker-centric IoT in brownfield industrial environments with stringent safety and regulatory constraints. Sensors, standards, and operational constraints in hazardous zones
A technician in a chemical plant needs to log temperature readings, check equipment vibration, and photograph a valve assembly. Standard procedure, but in a Zone 2 hazardous area, standard electronics won’t do. The risk isn’t the device itself – it’s what happens if a component fails and creates a spark, or if a surface gets hot enough to ignite surrounding gases.
Industrial IoT in petrochemical, mining, and pharmaceutical facilities comes down to collecting sensor data while ensuring equipment remains intrinsically safe.

      <title><![CDATA[Community Evals: Because we're done trusting black-box leaderboards over the community]]></title>
      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/community-evals</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles Evaluation is broken What We're Shipping Why This Matters Get Started TL;DR: Benchmark datasets on Hugging Face can now host leaderboards. Models store their own eval scores. Everything links together. The community can submit results via PR. Verified badges prove that the results can be reproduced. Evaluation is broken Let's be real about where we are with evals in 2026. MMLU is saturated above 91%. GSM8K hit 94%+. HumanEval is conquered. Yet some models that ace benchmarks still can't reliably browse the web, write production code, or handle multi-step tasks without hallucinating, based on usage reports. There is a clear gap between benchmark scores and real-world performance.
Furthermore, there is another gap within reported benchmark scores. Multiple sources report different results. From Model Cards, to papers, to evaluation platforms, there is no alignment in reported scores. The result is that the community lacks a single source of truth. What We're Shipping Decentralized and transparent evaluation reporting.
We are going to take evaluations on the Hugging Face Hub in a new direction by decentralizing reporting and allowing the entire community to openly report scores for benchmarks. At first, we will start with a shortlist of 4 benchmarks and over time we’ll expand to the most relev]]></description>

It automatically generates a visual canvas where you can inspect intermediate outputs, rerun individual steps, and manage state for complex pipelines, all in a few lines of Python code! Table of Contents Background
Getting Started
Sharing Your Workflows
End-to-End Example with Different Nodes
Next Steps Background If you've built AI applications that combine multiple models or processing steps, you know the pain: chaining API calls, debugging pipelines, and losing track of intermediate results. When something goes wrong in step 5 of a 10-step workflow, you often have to re-run everything just to see what happened.
Most developers either build fragile scripts that are hard to debug or turn to heavy orchestration platforms designed for production pipelines—not rapid experimentation.
We've been working on Daggr to solve problems we kept running into when building AI demos and workflows:
Visualize your code flow: Unlike node-based GUI editors, where you drag and connect nodes visually, Daggr takes a code-first approach. You define workflo]]></description>

Take your skill to an open source, smaller, or cheaper model Deep dive tutorial into building kernels with agent skills Setup and Install Skill Generation Generate the Skill Evaluate on a Different Model How the evaluation in upskill works What's Next Resources The best thing about agent skills is upskilling your agents on hard problems. There are two ways to look at that: You can take Opus 4.5 or other SOTA models and tackle the hardest problems out there. You can take models that run on your laptop and upskill them to harder problems. In this blog post, we’ll show you how to take on the latter. This blog post walks through the process of using a new tool, upskill, to generate and evaluate agent skills with large models and use them with smaller models. We will benchmark upskill on the task of writing CUDA kernels for diffusers models, but the process is generally useful for cutting costs, or using smaller models on hard and domain-specific problems. What are agent skills? In case you missed it, agent skills are taking the coding agent game by storm. In fact, they’re a straightforward concept to define model context as files, like instructions as markdown and code as scripts. The file for]]></description>

The first blog is available here, and the third blog is available here.
In this second piece we turn our focus from models to the architectural and hardware choices Chinese companies have made as openness becomes the norm.
For AI researchers and developers contributing to and relying on the open source ecosystem and for policymakers understanding the rapidly changing environment, architectural preferences, modality diversification, license permissiveness, small model popularity, and growing adoption of Chinese hardware point to leadership strategies across a multitude of paths. DeepSeek R1's own characteristics inspired overlap and competition, and contributed to heavier focus on domestic hardware in China. Mixture of Experts (MoE) as the Default Choice In the past year, leading models from the Chinese community had almost unanimously moved toward Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, including Kimi K2, MiniMax M2, and Qwen3. R1 itself was an MoE model, it also prove]]></description>

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/LinkedIn/gpt-oss-agentic-rl</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) extends traditional LLM training by optimizing not just a single-turn response, but an entire decision-making process learned through direct interaction with an environment during training. Unlike traditional single-turn reinforcement learning or offline preference-based methods that rely on static datasets, agentic RL trains policies by actively collecting on-policy data as the agent plans actions, invokes tools, observes outcomes, and adapts its behavior over multi-step trajectories in either simulated or real environments. This interaction-driven optimization assigns credit across long-horizon decisions, where intermediate choices such as query reformulation, tool selection, and execution order directly influence downstream success. Training follows an iterative closed loop in which the agent interacts with the environment to collect rollout trajectories, computes rewards over these trajectories, updates the policy based on observed outcomes, and then uses the updated policy to drive the next round of interaction and data collection such as GRPO or PPO algorithms..

      <link>https://venturebeat.com/infrastructure/railway-secures-usd100-million-to-challenge-aws-with-ai-native-cloud</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Railway, a San Francisco-based cloud platform that has quietly amassed two million developers without spending a dollar on marketing, announced Thursday that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, as surging demand for artificial intelligence applications exposes the limitations of legacy cloud infrastructure.
TQ Ventures led the round, with participation from FPV Ventures, Redpoint, and Unusual Ventures. The investment values Railway as one of the most significant infrastructure startups to emerge during the AI boom, capitalizing on developer frustration with the complexity and cost of traditional platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.
"As AI models get better at writing code, more and more people are asking the age-old question: where, and how, do I run my applications?" said Jake Cooper, Railway's 28-year-old founder and chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. "The last generation of cloud primitives were slow and outdated, and now with AI moving everything faster, teams simply can't keep up."
The funding is a dramatic acceleration for a company that has charted an unconventional path through the cloud computing industry. Railway raised just $24 million in total before this round, including a $20 million Series A from Redpoint in 2022. The company now processes more than 10 million deployments monthly and handles over one trillion requests through its edge network — metrics that rival far larger and better-funded competitors.
Why three-minute deploy times have become unacceptable in the age of AI coding assistants
Railway's pitch rests on a simple observation: the tools developers use to deploy and manage software were designed for a slower era. A standard build-and-deploy cycle using Terraform, the industry-standard infrastructure tool, takes two to three minutes. That delay, once tolerable, has become a critical bottleneck as AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor can generate working code in seconds.
"When godly intelligence is on tap and can solve any problem in three seconds, those amalgamations of systems become bottlenecks," Cooper told VentureBeat. "What was really cool for humans to deploy in 10 seconds or less is now table stakes for agents."
The company claims its platform delivers deployments in under one second — fast enough to keep pace with AI-generated code. Customers report a tenfold increase in developer velocity and up to 65 percent cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.
These numbers come directly from enterprise clients, not internal benchmarks. Daniel Lobaton, chief technology officer at G2X, a platform serving 100,000 federal contractors, measured deployment speed improvements of seven times faster and an 87 percent cost reduction after migrating to Railway. His infrastructure bill dropped from $15,000 per month to approximately $1,000.
"The work that used to take me a week on our previous infrastructure, I can do in Railway in like a day," Lobaton said. "If I want to spin up a new service and test different architectures, it would take so long on our old setup. In Railway I can launch six services in two minutes."
Inside the controversial decision to abandon Google Cloud and build data centers from scratch
What distinguishes Railway from competitors like Render and Fly.io is the depth of its vertical integration. In 2024, the company made the unusual decision to abandon Google Cloud entirely and build its own data centers, a move that echoes the famous Alan Kay maxim: "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware."
"We wanted to design hardware in a way where we could build a differentiated experience," Cooper said. "Having full control over the network, compute, and storage layers lets us do really fast build and deploy loops, the kind that allows us to move at 'agentic speed' while staying 100 percent the smoothest ride in town."
The approach paid dividends during recent widespread outages that affected major cloud providers — Railway remained online throughout.
This soup-to-nuts control enables pricing that undercuts the hyperscalers by roughly 50 percent and newer cloud startups by three to four times. Railway charges by the second for actual compute usage: $0.00000386 per gigabyte-second of memory, $0.00000772 per vCPU-second, and $0.00000006 per gigabyte-second of storage. There are no charges for idle virtual machines — a stark contrast to the traditional cloud model where customers pay for provisioned capacity whether they use it or not.
"The conventional wisdom is that the big guys have economies of scale to offer better pricing," Cooper noted. "But when they're charging for VMs that usually sit idle in the cloud, and we've purpose-built everything to fit much more density on these machines, you have a big opportunity."
How 30 employees built a platform generating tens of millions in annual revenue
Railway has achieved its scale with a team of just 30 employees generating tens of millions in annual revenue — a ratio of revenue per employee that would be exceptional even for established software companies. The company grew revenue 3.5 times last year and continues to expand at 15 percent month-over-month.
Cooper emphasized that the fundraise was strategic rather than necessary. "We're default alive; there's no reason for us to raise money," he said. "We raised because we see a massive opportunity to accelerate, not because we needed to survive."
The company hired its first salesperson only last year and employs just two solutions engineers. Nearly all of Railway's two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.
"We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come," Cooper recalled. "And to some degree, they came."
From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway's unlikely corporate expansion
Despite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.
Notable customers include Bilt, the loyalty program company; Intuit's GoCo subsidiary; TripAdvisor's Cruise Critic; and MGM Resorts. Kernel, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.
"At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS," said Rafael Garcia, Kernel's chief technology officer. "Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012."
For enterprise customers, Railway offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer's existing cloud environment through a "bring your own cloud" configuration.
Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).
The startup's bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivals
Railway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.
Cooper argues that Railway's competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.
"The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven't gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money," he observed. "They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don't really need to?"
Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. "We're not just containers; we've got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing," Cooper said. "And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster."
The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.
Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists today
Railway's fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.
"The amount of software that's going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we're talking a thousand times more software," Cooper predicted. "All of that has to run somewhere."
The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls "loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically." Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.
"The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes," Cooper said. "You don't have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity."
What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experience
Railway plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company's five-year history.
"One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business," Cooper explained. "We've built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what's been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage."
The company's investor roster reads like a who's who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Guillermo Rauch, chief executive of Vercel; Spencer Kimball, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; Olivier Pomel, chief executive of Datadog; and Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear.
The timing of Railway's expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper's telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.
Whether Railway can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at Wolfram Alpha, Bloomberg, and Uber before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.
"In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period," he said. "Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That's the prize worth playing for, and there's no bigger one on offer."
For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.]]></description>

      <link>https://venturebeat.com/infrastructure/claude-code-costs-up-to-usd200-a-month-goose-does-the-same-thing-for-free</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The artificial intelligence coding revolution comes with a catch: it's expensive.
Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-based AI agent that can write, debug, and deploy code autonomously, has captured the imagination of software developers worldwide. But its pricing — ranging from $20 to $200 per month depending on usage — has sparked a growing rebellion among the very programmers it aims to serve.
Now, a free alternative is gaining traction. Goose, an open-source AI agent developed by Block (the financial technology company formerly known as Square), offers nearly identical functionality to Claude Code but runs entirely on a user's local machine. No subscription fees. No cloud dependency. No rate limits that reset every five hours.
"Your data stays with you, period," said Parth Sareen, a software engineer who demonstrated the tool during a recent livestream. The captures the core appeal: Goose gives developers complete control over their AI-powered workflow, including the ability to work offline — even on an airplane.
The project has exploded in popularity. Goose now boasts more than 26,100 stars on GitHub, the code-sharing platform, with 362 contributors and 102 releases since its launch. The latest version, 1.20.1, shipped on January 19, 2026, reflecting a development pace that rivals commercial products.
For developers frustrated by Claude Code's pricing structure and usage caps, Goose represents something increasingly rare in the AI industry: a genuinely free, no-strings-attached option for serious work. Anthropic's new rate limits spark a developer revolt
To understand why Goose matters, you need to understand the Claude Code pricing controversy.
Anthropic, the San Francisco artificial intelligence company founded by former OpenAI executives, offers Claude Code as part of its subscription tiers. The free plan provides no access whatsoever. The Pro plan, at $17 per month with annual billing (or $20 monthly), limits users to just 10 to 40 prompts every five hours — a constraint that serious developers exhaust within minutes of intensive work.
The Max plans, at $100 and $200 per month, offer more headroom: 50 to 200 prompts and 200 to 800 prompts respectively, plus access to Anthropic's most powerful model, Claude 4.5 Opus. But even these premium tiers come with restrictions that have inflamed the developer community.
In late July, Anthropic announced new weekly rate limits. Under the system, Pro users receive 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 usage per week. Max users at the $200 tier get 240 to 480 hours of Sonnet 4, plus 24 to 40 hours of Opus 4. Nearly five months later, the frustration has not subsided.
The problem? Those "hours" are not actual hours. They represent token-based limits that vary wildly depending on codebase size, conversation length, and the complexity of the code being processed. Independent analysis suggests the actual per-session limits translate to roughly 44,000 tokens for Pro users and 220,000 tokens for the $200 Max plan.
"It's confusing and vague," one developer wrote in a widely shared analysis. "When they say '24-40 hours of Opus 4,' that doesn't really tell you anything useful about what you're actually getting."
The backlash on Reddit and developer forums has been fierce. Some users report hitting their daily limits within 30 minutes of intensive coding. Others have canceled their subscriptions entirely, calling the new restrictions "a joke" and "unusable for real work."
Anthropic has defended the changes, stating that the limits affect fewer than five percent of users and target people running Claude Code "continuously in the background, 24/7." But the company has not clarified whether that figure refers to five percent of Max subscribers or five percent of all users — a distinction that matters enormously.
How Block built a free AI coding agent that works offline
Goose takes a radically different approach to the same problem.
Built by Block, the payments company led by Jack Dorsey, Goose is what engineers call an "on-machine AI agent." Unlike Claude Code, which sends your queries to Anthropic's servers for processing, Goose can run entirely on your local computer using open-source language models that you download and control yourself.
The project's documentation describes it as going "beyond code suggestions" to "install, execute, edit, and test with any LLM." That last phrase — "any LLM" — is the key differentiator. Goose is model-agnostic by design.
You can connect Goose to Anthropic's Claude models if you have API access. You can use OpenAI's GPT-5 or Google's Gemini. You can route it through services like Groq or OpenRouter. Or — and this is where things get interesting — you can run it entirely locally using tools like Ollama, which let you download and execute open-source models on your own hardware.
The practical implications are significant. With a local setup, there are no subscription fees, no usage caps, no rate limits, and no concerns about your code being sent to external servers. Your conversations with the AI never leave your machine.
"I use Ollama all the time on planes — it's a lot of fun!" Sareen noted during a demonstration, highlighting how local models free developers from the constraints of internet connectivity.
What Goose can do that traditional code assistants can't
Goose operates as a command-line tool or desktop application that can autonomously perform complex development tasks. It can build entire projects from scratch, write and execute code, debug failures, orchestrate workflows across multiple files, and interact with external APIs — all without constant human oversight.
The architecture relies on what the AI industry calls "tool calling" or "function calling" — the ability for a language model to request specific actions from external systems. When you ask Goose to create a new file, run a test suite, or check the status of a GitHub pull request, it doesn't just generate text describing what should happen. It actually executes those operations.
This capability depends heavily on the underlying language model. Claude 4 models from Anthropic currently perform best at tool calling, according to the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, which ranks models on their ability to translate natural language requests into executable code and system commands.
But newer open-source models are catching up quickly. Goose's documentation highlights several options with strong tool-calling support: Meta's Llama series, Alibaba's Qwen models, Google's Gemma variants, and DeepSeek's reasoning-focused architectures.
The tool also integrates with the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, an emerging standard for connecting AI agents to external services. Through MCP, Goose can access databases, search engines, file systems, and third-party APIs — extending its capabilities far beyond what the base language model provides.
Setting Up Goose with a Local Model
For developers interested in a completely free, privacy-preserving setup, the process involves three main components: Goose itself, Ollama (a tool for running open-source models locally), and a compatible language model.
Step 1: Install Ollama
Ollama is an open-source project that dramatically simplifies the process of running large language models on personal hardware. It handles the complex work of downloading, optimizing, and serving models through a simple interface.
Download and install Ollama from ollama.com. Once installed, you can pull models with a single command. For coding tasks, Qwen 2.5 offers strong tool-calling support:
ollama run qwen2.5
The model downloads automatically and begins running on your machine.
Step 2: Install Goose
Goose is available as both a desktop application and a command-line interface. The desktop version provides a more visual experience, while the CLI appeals to developers who prefer working entirely in the terminal.
Installation instructions vary by operating system but generally involve downloading from Goose's GitHub releases page or using a package manager. Block provides pre-built binaries for macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux.
Step 3: Configure the Connection
In Goose Desktop, navigate to Settings, then Configure Provider, and select Ollama. Confirm that the API Host is set to http://localhost:11434 (Ollama's default port) and click Submit.
For the command-line version, run goose configure, select "Configure Providers," choose Ollama, and enter the model name when prompted.
That's it. Goose is now connected to a language model running entirely on your hardware, ready to execute complex coding tasks without any subscription fees or external dependencies.
The RAM, processing power, and trade-offs you should know about
The obvious question: what kind of computer do you need?
Running large language models locally requires substantially more computational resources than typical software. The key constraint is memory — specifically, RAM on most systems, or VRAM if using a dedicated graphics card for acceleration.
Block's documentation suggests that 32 gigabytes of RAM provides "a solid baseline for larger models and outputs." For Mac users, this means the computer's unified memory is the primary bottleneck. For Windows and Linux users with discrete NVIDIA graphics cards, GPU memory (VRAM) matters more for acceleration.
But you don't necessarily need expensive hardware to get started. Smaller models with fewer parameters run on much more modest systems. Qwen 2.5, for instance, comes in multiple sizes, and the smaller variants can operate effectively on machines with 16 gigabytes of RAM.
"You don't need to run the largest models to get excellent results," Sareen emphasized. The practical recommendation: start with a smaller model to test your workflow, then scale up as needed.
For context, Apple's entry-level MacBook Air with 8 gigabytes of RAM would struggle with most capable coding models. But a MacBook Pro with 32 gigabytes — increasingly common among professional developers — handles them comfortably.
Why keeping your code off the cloud matters more than ever
Goose with a local LLM is not a perfect substitute for Claude Code. The comparison involves real trade-offs that developers should understand.
Model Quality: Claude 4.5 Opus, Anthropic's flagship model, remains arguably the most capable AI for software engineering tasks. It excels at understanding complex codebases, following nuanced instructions, and producing high-quality code on the first attempt. Open-source models have improved dramatically, but a gap persists — particularly for the most challenging tasks.
One developer who switched to the $200 Claude Code plan described the difference bluntly: "When I say 'make this look modern,' Opus knows what I mean. Other models give me Bootstrap circa 2015."
Context Window: Claude Sonnet 4.5, accessible through the API, offers a massive one-million-token context window — enough to load entire large codebases without chunking or context management issues. Most local models are limited to 4,096 or 8,192 tokens by default, though many can be configured for longer contexts at the cost of increased memory usage and slower processing.
Speed: Cloud-based services like Claude Code run on dedicated server hardware optimized for AI inference. Local models, running on consumer laptops, typically process requests more slowly. The difference matters for iterative workflows where you're making rapid changes and waiting for AI feedback.
Tooling Maturity: Claude Code benefits from Anthropic's dedicated engineering resources. Features like prompt caching (which can reduce costs by up to 90 percent for repeated contexts) and structured outputs are polished and well-documented. Goose, while actively developed with 102 releases to date, relies on community contributions and may lack equivalent refinement in specific areas.
How Goose stacks up against Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and the paid AI coding market
Goose enters a crowded market of AI coding tools, but occupies a distinctive position.
Cursor, a popular AI-enhanced code editor, charges $20 per month for its Pro tier and $200 for Ultra—pricing that mirrors Claude Code's Max plans. Cursor provides approximately 4,500 Sonnet 4 requests per month at the Ultra level, a substantially different allocation model than Claude Code's hourly resets.
Cline, Roo Code, and similar open-source projects offer AI coding assistance but with varying levels of autonomy and tool integration. Many focus on code completion rather than the agentic task execution that defines Goose and Claude Code.
Amazon's CodeWhisperer, GitHub Copilot, and enterprise offerings from major cloud providers target large organizations with complex procurement processes and dedicated budgets. They are less relevant to individual developers and small teams seeking lightweight, flexible tools.
Goose's combination of genuine autonomy, model agnosticism, local operation, and zero cost creates a unique value proposition. The tool is not trying to compete with commercial offerings on polish or model quality. It's competing on freedom — both financial and architectural.
The $200-a-month era for AI coding tools may be ending]]></description>

      <link>https://venturebeat.com/technology/listen-labs-raises-usd69m-after-viral-billboard-hiring-stunt-to-scale-ai</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup, Listen Labs, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million offers seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a billboard in San Francisco displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.
The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.
That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by Ribbit Capital with participation from Evantic and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Conviction, and Pear VC. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews. "When you obsess over customers, everything else follows," Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. "Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is."
Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it
Listen's AI researcher finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.
Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: "Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can't get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys." The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, "gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they're talking about. And the problem is you can't scale that."
The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.
What distinguishes Listen's approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. "In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options," Wahlforss said. "Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty."
The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraud
Listen finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called "one of the most shocking things that we've learned when we entered this industry"—rampant fraud.
"Essentially, there's a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players," he explained. "We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud."
The company built what it calls a "quality guard" that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: "People talk three times more. They're much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health."
Emeritus, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. "We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information," said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.
How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better products
The speed advantage has proven central to Listen's pitch. Traditional customer research at Microsoft could take four to six weeks to generate insights. "By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it," said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.
With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.
The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. "We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward," Patel said, "and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day." Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.
Simple Modern, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. "We went from 'Should we even have this product?' to 'How should we launch it?'" said Chris Hoyle, the company's Chief Marketing Officer.
Chubbies, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. "There's school, sports, dinner, and homework," explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. "I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules."
The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI "through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed." The redesigned product became "a blockbuster hit."
The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not less
Listen Labs is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly $140 billion annually, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption.
"There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing," Wahlforss said. "Why we're replacing them is that one, they're super costly. Two, they're kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with."
But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn't just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption.
"What I've noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don't need less of it. You want more of it," Wahlforss explained. "There's infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren't researchers before can now do that as part of their job."
Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toilet
Listen Labs traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. "We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day," Wahlforss recalled. "We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today."
The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss's co-founder "was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot." The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the International Olympiad in Informatics — the same competition that produced the founders of Cognition, the AI coding startup.
The Berghain billboard stunt generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.
"We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet," he said. "But now we fixed that situation."
The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.
Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building next
Wahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building "the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we've done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices."
Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. "Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?"
Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. "Obviously, as you said, there's kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop."
The company already handles sensitive data with care. "We don't train on any of the data," Wahlforss said. "We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that."
How AI could reshape the future of product development
Perhaps the most provocative implication of Listen's model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop.
"They're based in Australia, so they're coding during the day, and then in their night, they're releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate."
The vision extends Y Combinator's famous dictum — "write code, talk to users" — into an automated cycle. "Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you'll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously."
Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen's control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A 2024 MIT study found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos.
"I'm constantly have to emphasize like, let's make sure the quality is there and the details are right," he said.
But the company's growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft's Patel said Listen has "removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work." Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day.
"It's a total game changer," said Ali Romero, Sling Money's marketing manager.
Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he's building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website.
One of them: "Slow is fake."
It's an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution. But Listen Labs is betting that in the AI era, the companies that listen fastest will be the ones that win. The only question is whether customers will talk back.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Salesforce rolls out new Slackbot AI agent as it battles Microsoft and Google in workplace AI]]></title>
      <link>https://venturebeat.com/technology/salesforce-rolls-out-new-slackbot-ai-agent-as-it-battles-microsoft-and</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Salesforce on Tuesday launched an entirely rebuilt version of Slackbot, the company's workplace assistant, transforming it from a simple notification tool into what executives describe as a fully powered AI agent capable of searching enterprise data, drafting documents, and taking action on behalf of employees.
The new Slackbot, now generally available to Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, is Salesforce's most aggressive move yet to position Slack at the center of the emerging "agentic AI" movement — where software agents work alongside humans to complete complex tasks. The launch comes as Salesforce attempts to convince investors that artificial intelligence will bolster its products rather than render them obsolete.
"Slackbot isn't just another copilot or AI assistant," said Parker Harris, Salesforce co-founder and Slack's chief technology officer, in an exclusive interview with Salesforce. "It's the front door to the agentic enterprise, powered by Salesforce."
From tricycle to Porsche: Salesforce rebuilt Slackbot from the ground up
Harris was blunt about what distinguishes the new Slackbot from its predecessor: "The old Slackbot was, you know, a little tricycle, and the new Slackbot is like, you know, a Porsche."
The original Slackbot, which has existed since Slack's early days, performed basic algorithmic tasks — reminding users to add colleagues to documents, suggesting channel archives, and delivering simple notifications. The new version runs on an entirely different architecture built around a large language model and sophisticated search capabilities that can access Salesforce records, Google Drive files, calendar data, and years of Slack conversations.
"It's two different things," Harris explained. "The old Slackbot was algorithmic and fairly simple. The new Slackbot is brand new — it's based around an LLM and a very robust search engine, and connections to third-party search engines, third-party enterprise data."
Salesforce chose to retain the Slackbot brand despite the fundamental technical overhaul. "People know what Slackbot is, and so we wanted to carry that forward," Harris said.
Why Anthropic's Claude powers the new Slackbot — and which AI models could come next
The new Slackbot runs on Claude, Anthropic's large language model, a choice driven partly by compliance requirements. Slack's commercial service operates under FedRAMP Moderate certification to serve U.S. federal government customers, and Harris said Anthropic was "the only provider that could give us a compliant LLM" when Slack began building the new system.
But that exclusivity won't last. "We are, this year, going to support additional providers," Harris said. "We have a great relationship with Google. Gemini is incredible — performance is great, cost is great. So we're going to use Gemini for some things." He added that OpenAI remains a possibility as well.
Harris echoed Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's view that large language models are becoming commoditized: "You've heard Marc talk about LLMs are commodities, that they're democratized. I call them CPUs."
On the sensitive question of training data, Harris was unequivocal: Salesforce does not train any models on customer data. "Models don't have any sort of security," he explained. "If we trained it on some confidential conversation that you and I have, I don't want Carolyn to know — if I train it into the LLM, there is no way for me to say you get to see the answer, but Carolyn doesn't."
Inside Salesforce's internal experiment: 80,000 employees tested Slackbot with striking results
Salesforce has been testing the new Slackbot internally for months, rolling it out to all 80,000 employees. According to Ryan Gavin, Slack's chief marketing officer, the results have been striking: "It's the fastest adopted product in Salesforce history."
Internal data shows that two-thirds of Salesforce employees have tried the new Slackbot, with 80% of those users continuing to use it regularly. Internal satisfaction rates reached 96% — the highest for any AI feature Slack has shipped. Employees report saving between two and 20 hours per week.
The adoption happened largely organically. "I think it was about five days, and a Canvas was developed by our employees called 'The Most Stealable Slackbot Prompts,'" Gavin said. "People just started adding to it organically. I think it's up to 250-plus prompts that are in this Canvas right now."
Kate Crotty, a principal UX researcher at Salesforce, found that 73% of internal adoption was driven by social sharing rather than top-down mandates. "Everybody is there to help each other learn and communicate hacks," she said.
How Slackbot transforms scattered enterprise data into executive-ready insights
During a product demonstration, Amy Bauer, Slack's product experience designer, showed how Slackbot can synthesize information across multiple sources. In one example, she asked Slackbot to analyze customer feedback from a pilot program, upload an image of a usage dashboard, and have Slackbot correlate the qualitative and quantitative data.
"This is where Slackbot really earns its keep for me," Bauer explained. "What it's doing is not just simply reading the image — it's actually looking at the image and comparing it to the insight it just generated for me."
Slackbot can then query Salesforce to find enterprise accounts with open deals that might be good candidates for early access, creating what Bauer called "a really great justification and plan to move forward." Finally, it can synthesize all that information into a Canvas — Slack's collaborative document format — and find calendar availability among stakeholders to schedule a review meeting.
"Up until this point, we have been working in a one-to-one capacity with Slackbot," Bauer said. "But one of the benefits that I can do now is take this insight and have it generate this into a Canvas, a shared workspace where I can iterate on it, refine it with Slackbot, or share it out with my team."
Rob Seaman, Slack's chief product officer, said the Canvas creation demonstrates where the product is heading: "This is making a tool call internally to Slack Canvas to actually write, effectively, a shared document. But it signals where we're going with Slackbot — we're eventually going to be adding in additional third-party tool calls."
MrBeast's company became a Slackbot guinea pig—and employees say they're saving 90 minutes a day
Among Salesforce's pilot customers is Beast Industries, the parent company of YouTube star MrBeast. Luis Madrigal, the company's chief information officer, joined the launch announcement to describe his experience.
"As somebody who has rolled out enterprise technologies for over two decades now, this was practically one of the easiest," Madrigal said. "The plumbing is there. Slack as an implementation, Enterprise Tools — being able to turn on the Slackbot and the Slack AI functionality was as simple as having my team go in, review, do a quick security review."
Madrigal said his security team signed off "rather quickly" — unusual for enterprise AI deployments — because Slackbot accesses only the information each individual user already has permission to view. "Given all the guardrails you guys have put into place for Slackbot to be unique and customized to only the information that each individual user has, only the conversations and the Slack rooms and Slack channels that they're part of—that made my security team sign off rather quickly."
One Beast Industries employee, Sinan, the head of Beast Games marketing, reported saving "at bare minimum, 90 minutes a day." Another employee, Spencer, a creative supervisor, described it as "an assistant who's paying attention when I'm not."
Other pilot customers include Slalom, reMarkable, Xero, Mercari, and Engine. Mollie Bodensteiner, SVP of Operations at Engine, called Slackbot "an absolute 'chaos tamer' for our team," estimating it saves her about 30 minutes daily "just by eliminating context switching."

      <title><![CDATA[Anthropic launches Cowork, a Claude Desktop agent that works in your files — no coding required]]></title>
      <link>https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropic-launches-cowork-a-claude-desktop-agent-that-works-in-your-files-no</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Anthropic released Cowork on Monday, a new AI agent capability that extends the power of its wildly successful Claude Code tool to non-technical users — and according to company insiders, the team built the entire feature in approximately a week and a half, largely using Claude Code itself.
The launch marks a major inflection point in the race to deliver practical AI agents to mainstream users, positioning Anthropic to compete not just with OpenAI and Google in conversational AI, but with Microsoft's Copilot in the burgeoning market for AI-powered productivity tools.
"Cowork lets you complete non-technical tasks much like how developers use Claude Code," the company announced via its official Claude account on X. The feature arrives as a research preview available exclusively to Claude Max subscribers — Anthropic's power-user tier priced between $100 and $200 per month — through the macOS desktop application.
For the past year, the industry narrative has focused on large language models that can write poetry or debug code. With Cowork, Anthropic is betting that the real enterprise value lies in an AI that can open a folder, read a messy pile of receipts, and generate a structured expense report without human hand-holding. How developers using a coding tool for vacation research inspired Anthropic's latest product
The genesis of Cowork lies in Anthropic's recent success with the developer community. In late 2024, the company released Claude Code, a terminal-based tool that allowed software engineers to automate rote programming tasks. The tool was a hit, but Anthropic noticed a peculiar trend: users were forcing the coding tool to perform non-coding labor.
According to Boris Cherny, an engineer at Anthropic, the company observed users deploying the developer tool for an unexpectedly diverse array of tasks. "Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven," Cherny wrote on X. "These use cases are diverse and surprising — the reason is that the underlying Claude Agent is the best agent, and Opus 4.5 is the best model."
Recognizing this shadow usage, Anthropic effectively stripped the command-line complexity from their developer tool to create a consumer-friendly interface. In its blog post announcing the feature, Anthropic explained that developers "quickly began using it for almost everything else," which "prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude in the very same way."
Inside the folder-based architecture that lets Claude read, edit, and create files on your computer
Unlike a standard chat interface where a user pastes text for analysis, Cowork requires a different level of trust and access. Users designate a specific folder on their local machine that Claude can access. Within that sandbox, the AI agent can read existing files, modify them, or create entirely new ones.
Anthropic offers several illustrative examples: reorganizing a cluttered downloads folder by sorting and intelligently renaming each file, generating a spreadsheet of expenses from a collection of receipt screenshots, or drafting a report from scattered notes across multiple documents.
"In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder," the company explained on X. "Try it to create a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft from scattered notes." The architecture relies on what is known as an "agentic loop." When a user assigns a task, the AI does not merely generate a text response. Instead, it formulates a plan, executes steps in parallel, checks its own work, and asks for clarification if it hits a roadblock. Users can queue multiple tasks and let Claude process them simultaneously — a workflow Anthropic describes as feeling "much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker."
The system is built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK, meaning it shares the same underlying architecture as Claude Code. Anthropic notes that Cowork "can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks."
The recursive loop where AI builds AI: Claude Code reportedly wrote much of Claude Cowork
Perhaps the most remarkable detail surrounding Cowork's launch is the speed at which the tool was reportedly built — highlighting a recursive feedback loop where AI tools are being used to build better AI tools.
During a livestream hosted by Dan Shipper, Felix Rieseberg, an Anthropic employee, confirmed that the team built Cowork in approximately a week and a half.
Alex Volkov, who covers AI developments, expressed surprise at the timeline: "Holy shit Anthropic built 'Cowork' in the last... week and a half?!" This prompted immediate speculation about how much of Cowork was itself built by Claude Code. Simon Smith, EVP of Generative AI at Klick Health, put it bluntly on X: "Claude Code wrote all of Claude Cowork. Can we all agree that we're in at least somewhat of a recursive improvement loop here?"
The implication is profound: Anthropic's AI coding agent may have substantially contributed to building its own non-technical sibling product. If true, this is one of the most visible examples yet of AI systems being used to accelerate their own development and expansion — a strategy that could widen the gap between AI labs that successfully deploy their own agents internally and those that do not.
Connectors, browser automation, and skills extend Cowork's reach beyond the local file system
Cowork doesn't operate in isolation. The feature integrates with Anthropic's existing ecosystem of connectors — tools that link Claude to external information sources and services such as Asana, Notion, PayPal, and other supported partners. Users who have configured these connections in the standard Claude interface can leverage them within Cowork sessions.
Additionally, Cowork can pair with Claude in Chrome, Anthropic's browser extension, to execute tasks requiring web access. This combination allows the agent to navigate websites, click buttons, fill forms, and extract information from the internet — all while operating from the desktop application.
"Cowork includes a number of novel UX and safety features that we think make the product really special," Cherny explained, highlighting "a built-in VM [virtual machine] for isolation, out of the box support for browser automation, support for all your claude.ai data connectors, asking you for clarification when it's unsure."
Anthropic has also introduced an initial set of "skills" specifically designed for Cowork that enhance Claude's ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. These build on the Skills for Claude framework the company announced in October, which provides specialized instruction sets Claude can load for particular types of tasks.
Why Anthropic is warning users that its own AI agent could delete their files
The transition from a chatbot that suggests edits to an agent that makes edits introduces significant risk. An AI that can organize files can, theoretically, delete them.
In a notable display of transparency, Anthropic devoted considerable space in its announcement to warning users about Cowork's potential dangers — an unusual approach for a product launch.
The company explicitly acknowledges that Claude "can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it's instructed to." Because Claude might occasionally misinterpret instructions, Anthropic urges users to provide "very clear guidance" about sensitive operations.
More concerning is the risk of prompt injection attacks — a technique where malicious actors embed hidden instructions in content Claude might encounter online, potentially causing the agent to bypass safeguards or take harmful actions.
"We've built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections," Anthropic wrote, "but agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude's real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry."
The company characterized these risks as inherent to the current state of AI agent technology rather than unique to Cowork. "These risks aren't new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you're using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation," the announcement notes.
Anthropic's desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft Copilot
The launch of Cowork places Anthropic in direct competition with Microsoft, which has spent years attempting to integrate its Copilot AI into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.
However, Anthropic's approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application.
What distinguishes Anthropic's approach is its bottom-up evolution. Rather than designing an AI assistant and retrofitting agent capabilities, Anthropic built a powerful coding agent first — Claude Code — and is now abstracting its capabilities for broader audiences. This technical lineage may give Cowork more robust agentic behavior from the start.
Claude Code has generated significant enthusiasm among developers since its initial launch as a command-line tool in late 2024. The company expanded access with a web interface in October 2025, followed by a Slack integration in December. Cowork is the next logical step: bringing the same agentic architecture to users who may never touch a terminal.
Who can access Cowork now, and what's coming next for Windows and other platforms
For now, Cowork remains exclusive to Claude Max subscribers using the macOS desktop application. Users on other subscription tiers — Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise — can join a waitlist for future access.
Anthropic has signaled clear intentions to expand the feature's reach. The blog post explicitly mentions plans to add cross-device sync and bring Cowork to Windows as the company learns from the research preview.
Cherny set expectations appropriately, describing the product as "early and raw, similar to what Claude Code felt like when it first launched."
To access Cowork, Max subscribers can download or update the Claude macOS app and click on "Cowork" in the sidebar.
The real question facing enterprise AI adoption
For technical decision-makers, the implications of Cowork extend beyond any single product launch. The bottleneck for AI adoption is shifting — no longer is model intelligence the limiting factor, but rather workflow integration and user trust.
Anthropic's goal, as the company puts it, is to make working with Claude feel less like operating a tool and more like delegating to a colleague. Whether mainstream users are ready to hand over folder access to an AI that might misinterpret their instructions remains an open question.
But the speed of Cowork's development — a major feature built in ten days, possibly by the company's own AI — previews a future where the capabilities of these systems compound faster than organizations can evaluate them. The chatbot has learned to use a file manager. What it learns to use next is anyone's guess.]]></description>

      <link>https://venturebeat.com/technology/nous-researchs-nouscoder-14b-is-an-open-source-coding-model-landing-right-in</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Nous Research, the open-source artificial intelligence startup backed by crypto venture firm Paradigm, released a new competitive programming model on Monday that it says matches or exceeds several larger proprietary systems — trained in just four days using 48 of Nvidia's latest B200 graphics processors.
The model, called NousCoder-14B, is another entry in a crowded field of AI coding assistants, but arrives at a particularly charged moment: Claude Code, the agentic programming tool from rival Anthropic, has dominated social media discussion since New Year's Day, with developers posting breathless testimonials about its capabilities. The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving — and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written.
type: embedded-entry-inline id: 74cSyrq6OUrp9SEQ5zOUSl
NousCoder-14B achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on LiveCodeBench v6, a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba's Qwen3-14B, according to Nous Research's technical report published alongside the release.
"I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour," wrote Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing — a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt.
The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic's Claude Code has captured imaginations with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap — and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability. How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicate
What distinguishes the NousCoder-14B release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the model weights but the complete reinforcement learning environment, benchmark suite, and training harness — built on the company's Atropos framework — enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to reproduce or extend the work.
"Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research," noted one observer on X, summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities.
The model was trained by Joe Li, a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li's technical report reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model's improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance.
Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B's improvemen t— from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 — mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days.
"Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience," Li wrote in the technical report.
But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners. Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problems
NousCoder-14B's training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.
The approach relies on what researchers call "verifiable rewards" — a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale.
Nous Research used Modal, a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints — 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively.
The training employed a technique called DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization), which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves "dynamic sampling" — discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning.
The researchers also adopted "iterative context extension," first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent.
Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification — as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters. The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progress
Buried in Li's technical report is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses "a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format."
In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data.
"The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude," Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. "This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data."
This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is "increasingly finite," as Li put it.
"It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures," he concluded.
The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn't — making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult.
Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. "Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction," he wrote. A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big Tech]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[The creator of Claude Code just revealed his workflow, and developers are losing their minds]]></title>
      <link>https://venturebeat.com/technology/the-creator-of-claude-code-just-revealed-his-workflow-and-developers-are</link>
      <description><![CDATA[When the creator of the world's most advanced coding agent speaks, Silicon Valley doesn't just listen — it takes notes.
For the past week, the engineering community has been dissecting a thread on X from Boris Cherny, the creator and head of Claude Code at Anthropic. What began as a casual sharing of his personal terminal setup has spiraled into a viral manifesto on the future of software development, with industry insiders calling it a watershed moment for the startup. "If you're not reading the Claude Code best practices straight from its creator, you're behind as a programmer," wrote Jeff Tang, a prominent voice in the developer community. Kyle McNease, another industry observer, went further, declaring that with Cherny's "game-changing updates," Anthropic is "on fire," potentially facing "their ChatGPT moment."
The excitement stems from a paradox: Cherny's workflow is surprisingly simple, yet it allows a single human to operate with the output capacity of a small engineering department. As one user noted on X after implementing Cherny's setup, the experience "feels more like Starcraft" than traditional coding — a shift from typing syntax to commanding autonomous units.
Here is an analysis of the workflow that is reshaping how software gets built, straight from the architect himself. How running five AI agents at once turns coding into a real-time strategy game
The most striking revelation from Cherny's disclosure is that he does not code in a linear fashion. In the traditional "inner loop" of development, a programmer writes a function, tests it, and moves to the next. Cherny, however, acts as a fleet commander.
"I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal," Cherny wrote. "I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input."
By utilizing iTerm2 system notifications, Cherny effectively manages five simultaneous work streams. While one agent runs a test suite, another refactors a legacy module, and a third drafts documentation. He also runs "5-10 Claudes on claude.ai" in his browser, using a "teleport" command to hand off sessions between the web and his local machine.
This validates the "do more with less" strategy articulated by Anthropic President Daniela Amodei earlier this week. While competitors like OpenAI pursue trillion-dollar infrastructure build-outs, Anthropic is proving that superior orchestration of existing models can yield exponential productivity gains.
The counterintuitive case for choosing the slowest, smartest model
In a surprising move for an industry obsessed with latency, Cherny revealed that he exclusively uses Anthropic's heaviest, slowest model: Opus 4.5.
"I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything," Cherny explained. "It's the best coding model I've ever used, and even though it's bigger &amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it's better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end."
For enterprise technology leaders, this is a critical insight. The bottleneck in modern AI development isn't the generation speed of the token; it is the human time spent correcting the AI's mistakes. Cherny's workflow suggests that paying the "compute tax" for a smarter model upfront eliminates the "correction tax" later.
One shared file turns every AI mistake into a permanent lesson
Cherny also detailed how his team solves the problem of AI amnesia. Standard large language models do not "remember" a company's specific coding style or architectural decisions from one session to the next.
To address this, Cherny's team maintains a single file named CLAUDE.md in their git repository. "Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time," he wrote.]]></description>

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-evaluation-recipe</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles It has become increasingly challenging to assess whether a model’s
reported improvements reflect genuine advances or variations in
evaluation conditions, dataset composition, or training data that
mirrors benchmark tasks. The NVIDIA Nemotron approach to openness
addresses this by publishing transparent and reproducible evaluation
recipes that make results independently verifiable.
NVIDIA released Nemotron 3 Nano 30B
A3B
with an explicitly open evaluation approach to make that distinction
clear. Alongside the model card, we are publishing the complete
evaluation recipe used to generate the results, built with the
NVIDIA NeMo
Evaluator library, so
anyone can rerun the evaluation pipeline, inspect the artifacts, and
analyze the outcomes independently.
We believe that open innovation is the foundation of AI progress. This
level of transparency matters because most model evaluations omit
critical details. Configs, prompts, harness versions, runtime settings,
and logs are often missing or underspecified, and even small differences
in these parameters can materially change results. Without a complete
recipe, it’s nearly impossible to tell whether a model is genuinely
more intelligent or simply optimized for a benchmark.
This blog shows developers exactly how to reproduce the evaluation
behind Nemotron 3 Nano 30B
A3B

      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles Introduction Introduction What is CUGA? Open Source and Open Models Integration with Langflow: Visual Agent Design Made Simple Try the Hugging Face Demo: A Hands-On Preview Conclusion and Call to Action AI agents are rapidly becoming essential for building intelligent applications, but creating robust, adaptable agents that scale across domains remains a challenge. Many existing frameworks struggle with brittleness, tool misuse, and failures when faced with complex workflows.
CUGA (Configurable Generalist Agent) was designed to overcome these limitations. It's an open-source, AI Agent that combines flexibility, reliability, and ease of use for enterprise use cases. By abstracting orchestration complexity, CUGA empowers developers to focus on domain requirements rather than the internals of agent building. And now, with its integration into Hugging Face Spaces, experimenting with CUGA and open models has never been easier. What is CUGA? CUGA is a configurable, general-purpose AI agent that supports complex, multi-step tasks across web and API environments.

We gave Codex access to the Hugging Face Skills repository, which contains skills for Machine Learning and AI tasks such as training or evaluating models. With HF skills, a coding agent can: Fine-tune and apply RL alignment on language models
Review, explain, and act on live training metrics from Trackio
Evaluate checkpoints and act on evaluation results
Create reports from experiments
Export to and quantize models with GGUF for local deployment
Publish models to the Hub This tutorial dives even deeper and shows you how it works and how to use it yourself. So let's get started. Codex uses AGENTS.md files to accomplish specialized tasks, whilst Claude Code uses 'Skills'. Fortunately, 'HF-skills' is compatible with both approaches and works with major coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI. With HF-s]]></description>

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/intel-deepmath</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles Why DeepMath? How It Works Training with GRPO Evaluation Why It Matters Conclusion Try It Yourself Citation Limitations &amp; Future Work References By Intel AI Software Group
DeepMath is an aligned math reasoning agent built on Qwen3-4B Thinking and fine-tuned with GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization). Instead of verbose text, the model emits tiny Python snippets for intermediate steps, runs them in a secure sandbox, and folds the results back into its reasoning, reducing errors and output length. The agent is implemented using the smolagents library.
We evaluate DeepMath on four math datasets: MATH500, AIME, HMMT, and HLE, and show that: The math agent alone reduces output lengths by up to 66%, while often improving accuracy. GRPO training improves the agent performance even further, in almost all benchmarks. Code and evaluation scripts: https://github.com/IntelLabs/DeepMath Model: https://huggingface.co/Intel/deepmath-v1 Why DeepMath? Large language models (LLMs) have advanced reasoning capabilities, but mathematical problem-solving remains challenging; chain-of-thought traces can be lengthy and prone to arithmetic mistakes. Recent works[^1][^2] demonstrate that small models can reach strong performance, and other studies[^3] investigate tool use to improve reliability. What those papers genera]]></description>

Research is a foundational knowledge-work task: collecting, reading, and synthesizing information underpins everything from writing and decision-making to coding itself. Yet human-driven research is constrained by memory, reading speed, and time. AI research agents, by contrast, can process vast amounts of information, synthesize insights instantly, and scale effortlessly. Because of this, research agents are emerging as a top use case for AI today and will soon become a core subcomponent of broader agentic workflows across content generation, coding, sales, and more. In this post, we share the technical and philosophical lessons we’ve learned building a state-of-the-art research agent, and where we believe the field is headed.

Long-form transcription is a different game While everyone (and their grandma ) is spinning up new ASR models, picking the right one for your use case can feel more overwhelming than choosing your next Netflix show. As of 21 Nov 2025, there are 150 Audio-Text-to-Text and 27K ASR models on the Hub Most benchmarks focus on short-form English transcription (&lt;30s), and overlook other important tasks, such as (1) multilingual performance and (2) model throughput, which can a be deciding factor for long-form audio like meetings and podcasts.
Over the past two years, the Open ASR Leaderboard has become a standard for comparing open and closed-source models on both accuracy and efficiency. Recently, multilingual and long-form transcription tracks have been added to the leaderboard TL;DR - Open ASR Leaderboard New preprint on ASR trends from the leaderboard: https://hf.co/papers/2510.06961 Best accuracy: Conformer encoder + LLM decoders (open-source ftw ) Fastest: CTC / TDT decoders Multilingual: Comes at the cost of single-language performance Long-form: Closed-source systems still lead (for now ) Fine-tuning guides (Parakeet, Voxtral, Whisper): to continue pushing performance]]></description>

But compiling these kernels for the right architectures, wiring all the build flags, and integrating them cleanly into PyTorch extensions can quickly become a mess of CMake/Nix, compiler errors, and ABI issues, which is not fun. Hugging Face’s kernels library makes it easy to build (with kernel-builder) and share these kernels with the kernels-community, with support for multiple GPU and accelerator backends, including CUDA, ROCm, Metal, and XPU. This ensures your kernels are fast, portable, and seamlessly integrated with PyTorch.
In this guide, we focus exclusively on ROCm-compatible kernels and show how to build, test, and share them using kernels. You’ll learn how to create kernels that run efficiently on AMD GPUs, along with best practices for reproducibility, packaging, and deployment.
This ROCm-specific walkthrough is a streamlined version of the original kerne]]></description>

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/MiniMax-AI/aligning-to-what</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles The Real Agent Alignment Problem: Benchmarks or Reality? The Need for Interleaved Thinking True Generalization is About Perturbation What's Next? Getting Involved It's been fantastic to see the community dive into our new MiniMax M2, with many highlighting its impressive skills in complex agentic tasks. This is particularly exciting for me, as my work was centered on the agent alignment part of its post-training. In this post, I'd like to share some of the key insights and lessons we learned during that process. The Real Agent Alignment Problem: Benchmarks or Reality? If you've worked with LLM Agents, you've felt this pain: the same model can feel brilliant in one framework and useless in another. An agent might crush a tool-use leaderboard but fail spectacularly at a simple, real-world task. This gap between benchmark performance and practical usability is one of the biggest challenges in the field.
When we designed M2, we knew we had to tackle this problem head-on. This led us to two core, and sometimes conflicting, objectives: Excel on Open-Source Benchmarks. Benchmarks are essential for measuring "pure" capabilities. A benchmark like BrowseComp, for instance, tests for sophisticated search skills. While users will rarely ask a question as contrived as, "Find the paper where the third letter of the nth author's name is 'x',"]]></description>

China’s immense progress in open-weight AI development is now being met with rapid domestic AI chip development. In the past few months, highly performant open-weight AI models’ inference in China has started to be powered by chips such as Huawei’s Ascend and Cambricon, with some models starting to be trained using domestic chips. There are two large implications for policymakers and AI researchers and developers respectively: U.S. export controls correlates with expedited Chinese chip production, and chip scarcity in China likely incentivized many of the innovations that are open-sourced and shaping global AI development.
China’s chip development correlates highly with stronger export controls from the U.S. Under uncertainty of chip access, Chinese companies have innovated wit]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles TLDR Streaming: The Same Easy API The Challenge: Streaming at Scale Under the Hood: What We Improved How are we faster than plain S3: Xet Need a custom streaming pipeline ? Push streaming to the limit Get Started and See the Difference TLDR We boosted load_dataset('dataset', streaming=True), streaming datasets without downloading them with one line of code!
Start training on multi-TB datasets immediately, without complex setups, downloading, no "disk out of space", or 429 “stop requesting!” errors.It's super fast! Outrunning our local SSDs when training on 64xH100 with 256 workers downloading data.
We've improved streaming to have 100x fewer requests, → 10× faster data resolution → 2x sample/sec, → 0 worker crashes at 256 concurrent workers. Loading data, especially at the terabyte scale, is a major pain in any machine learning workflow. We suffered this while training SmolLM3, at one point we had to wait 3 hours before each run to download enough data. Streaming has always been possible in the datasets library, but large scale training with massive datasets remained a challenge. That changes today . We spent a few months improving the backend, focusing on streaming datasets to make it faster and more efficient.

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/openenv</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles The Problem The Solution The RFCs Use cases What’s Next With tools like TRL, TorchForge and verl, the open-source community has shown how to scale AI across complex compute infrastructure. But compute is only one side of the coin. The other side is the developer community; the people and tools that make agentic systems possible. That’s why Meta and Hugging Face are partnering to launch the OpenEnv Hub: a shared and open community hub for agentic environments.
Agentic environments define everything an agent needs to perform a task: the tools, APIs, credentials, execution context, and nothing else. They bring clarity, safety, and sandboxed control to agent behavior.
These environments can be used for both training and deployment, and serve as the foundation for scalable agentic development. The Problem Modern AI agents can act autonomously across thousands of tasks. However, a large language model isn’t enough to get those tasks to actually run — it needs access to the right tools. Exposing millions of tools directly to a model isn’t reasonable (or safe). Instead, we need agentic environments: secure, semantically clear sandboxes that define exactly what’s required for a task, and nothing more. These environments handle the critical details: Clear semantics about what a task needs

At its new home, Sentence Transformers will benefit from Hugging Face's robust infrastructure, including continuous integration and testing, ensuring that it stays up-to-date with the latest advancements in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing.
Sentence Transformers (a.k.a. SentenceBERT or SBERT) is a popular open-source library for generating high-quality embeddings that capture semantic meaning. Since its inception by Nils Reimers in 2019, Sentence Transformers has been widely adopted by researchers and practitioners for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including semantic search, semantic textual similarity, clustering, and paraphrase mining. After years of development and training by and for the community, over 16,000 Sentence Transformers models are publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub, serving more than a million monthly unique users.
"Sentence Transformers has been a huge success story and a culmination of our long-standing research on computing semantic similarities]]></description>

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/openvino-vlm</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles With the growing capability of large language models (LLMs), a new class of models has emerged: Vision Language Models (VLMs). These models can analyze images and videos to describe scenes, create captions, and answer questions about visual content.
While running AI models on your own device can be difficult as these models are often computationally demanding, it also offers significant benefits: including improved privacy since your data stays on your machine, and enhanced speed and reliability because you're not dependent on an internet connection or external servers. This is where tools like Optimum Intel and OpenVINO come in, along with a small, efficient model like SmolVLM. In this blog post, we'll walk you through three easy steps to get a VLM running locally, with no expensive hardware or GPUs required (though you can run all the code samples from this blog post on Intel GPUs). Deploy your model with Optimum Small models like SmolVLM are built for low-resource consumption, but they can be further optimized. In this blog post we will see how to optimize your model, to lower memory usage and speedup inference, making it more efficient for deployment on devices with limited resources.
To follow this tutorial, you need to install optimum and openvino, which you can do with:

Conclusion Acknowledgements Citation Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code is notoriously difficult. While humans can easily spot whether a piece of code "looks right," determining if it actually works correctly, handles edge cases properly, and produces the intended result requires running and testing it. This is why today, we're thrilled to announce BigCodeArena -- the first human-in-the-loop platform for evaluating code generation models through execution.
Inspired by LMArena for LLMs, we've built a platform that allows anyone to compare code generation models side-by-side, but with a crucial difference: you can actually run the code and see what it produces.

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/rteb</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles TL;DR – We’re excited to introduce the beta version of the Retrieval Embedding Benchmark (RTEB), a new benchmark designed to reliably evaluate the retrieval accuracy of embedding models for real-world applications. Existing benchmarks struggle to measure true generalization, while RTEB addresses this with a hybrid strategy of open and private datasets. Its goal is simple: to create a fair, transparent, and application-focused standard for measuring how models perform on data they haven’t seen before.
The performance of many AI applications, from RAG and agents to recommendation systems, is fundamentally limited by the quality of search and retrieval. As such, accurately measuring the retrieval quality of embedding models is a common pain point for developers. How do you really know how well a model will perform in the wild?
This is where things get tricky. The current standard for evaluation often relies on a model's "zero-shot" performance on public benchmarks. However, this is, at best, an approximation of a model's true generalization capabilities. When models are repeatedly evaluated against the same public datasets, a gap emerges between their reported scores and their actual performance on new, unseen data. Performance Discrepancy Between Public and Closed Datasets To address these challenges, we developed RTEB, a b]]></description>

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/ServiceNow-AI/sygra-data-gen-framework</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles Enter SyGra: One Framework for Every Data Challenge Why SyGra Matters SyGra Architecture Final Thoughts References When we think about building a model - be it a Large Language Model (LLM) or a Small Language Model (SLM) - the first thing we need is data. While a vast amount of open data is available, it rarely comes in the exact format required to train or align models.
In practice, we often face scenarios where the raw data isn't enough. We need data that is more structured, domain-specific, complex, or aligned with the task at hand. Let's look at some common situations: Complex Scenarios Missing You start with a simple dataset, but the model fails on advanced reasoning tasks. How do you generate more complex datasets to strengthen performance? Knowledge Base to Q&amp;A You already have a knowledge base, but it's not in Q&amp;A format. How can you transform it into a usable question-answering dataset? From SFT to DPO You've prepared a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset. But now you want to align your model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). How can you generate preference pairs? Depth of Questions You have a Q&amp;A dataset, but the questions are shallow. How can you create in-depth, multi-turn, or reasoning-heavy questions? Domain-Specific Mid-Training]]></description>

Evaluating on Gaia2 Beyond Gaia2: study your agents with ARE 1) Testing an agent on a simple task: event organisation 2) Understanding agents: deep diving the traces 3) Playing around and extending the demo: Connecting the agent to your own MCPs Conclusion In an ideal world, AI agents would be reliable assistants. When given a query, they would easily manage ambiguity in instructions, construct step-by-step plans, correctly identify necessary resources, execute those plans without getting sidetracked, and adapt to unexpected events, all while maintaining accuracy and avoiding hallucinations.
However, developing agents and testing these behaviors is no small feat: if you have ever tried to debug your own agent, you’ve probably observed how tedious and frustrating this can be. Existing evaluation environments are tightly coupled with the tasks they evaluate, lack real-world flexibility, and do not reflect the messy reality of open-world agents: simulated pages never fail to load, events don’t spontaneously emerge, and asynchronous chaos is absent.
That’s why we’re very happy to introduce Gaia2, the follow-up to the agentic benchmark GAIA, allowing analysis of considerably more complex be]]></description>

More than 500,000 models can be found on the Hugging Face hub, but it’s not always clear to users how to choose the best model for them, notably on the security aspects. Developers might find a model that perfectly fits their use case, but have no systematic way to evaluate its security posture, privacy implications, or potential failure modes. As models become more powerful and adoption accelerates, we need equally rapid progress in AI safety and security reporting. We're therefore excited to announce RiskRubric.ai, a novel initiative led by Cloud Security Alliance and Noma Security, with contributions by Haize Labs and Harmonic Security, for standardized and transparent risk assessment in the AI model ecosystem. Risk Rubric, a new Standardized Assessment of Risk for models RiskRubric.ai provides consistent, comparable risk scores across the entire model landscape, by evaluating models across six pillars: transparency, reliability, security, privacy, safety, and reputation.

      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles Getting Started in 5 Minutes How It Works: What This Means for Developers How Teams Are Using This Feature? Show Us What You Build! The pace of AI development today is breathtaking. Every single day, hundreds of new models appear on the Hugging Face Hub, some are specialized variants of popular base models like Llama or Qwen, others feature novel architectures or have been trained from scratch for specific domains. Whether it's a medical AI trained on clinical data, a coding assistant optimized for a particular programming language, or a multilingual model fine-tuned for specific cultural contexts, the Hugging Face Hub has become the beating heart of open-source AI innovation.
But here's the challenge: finding an amazing model is just the beginning. What happens when you discover a model that's 90% perfect for your use case, but you need that extra 10% of customization? Traditional fine-tuning infrastructure is complex, expensive, and often requires significant DevOps expertise to set up and maintain.
This is exactly the gap that Together AI and Hugging Face are bridging today. We're announcing a powerful new capability that makes the entire Hugging Face Hub available for fine-tuning using Together AI's infrastructure.

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/jupyter-agent-2</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles The past year has been all about giving LLMs more tools and autonomy to solve more complex and open ended tasks. The goal of the Jupyter Agent is to give the model the ultimate tool: code execution. A natural way to display multi-step code execution together with reasoning is within a Jupyter Notebook, which consists of code and markdown cells. So we built Jupyter Agent to act as an agent that can execute code directly inside a Jupyter notebook and use this environment to solve data analysis and data science tasks. Think of it like Cursor, but living natively inside your data science workflow.We built a demo of this vision with Qwen-3 Coder, currently one of the strongest coding models. This is a follow-up to our earlier work on jupyter-agent (v1).
While large models are starting to show useful behavior, the key question is how we can continue improving them. To this end, we focus on strengthening smaller models to perform well on agentic data science tasks as they currently struggle to compete with the large models.
The goal of this project is to build a pipeline to first generate high-quality training data, then fine-tune an existing small model, and finally evaluate whether the model's performance improves on relevant benchmarks.
Let’s begin with the last step: selecting a strong benchmark for evaluating models on data science tasks.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles A slimmed-down training pipeline from Kimina Prover, with core features and full compatibility with verl. We are happy to introduce kimina-prover-rl, an open-source training pipeline for formal theorem proving in Lean 4, based on a structured reasoning-then-generation paradigm inspired by DeepSeek-R1.
This training pipelinee is a simplified version of the system we used to train Kimina Prover, preserving the key components of the system and offering full compatibility with the open-source Verl framework.
It is released as part of a fork of Verl containing the complete training recipe in recipe/kimina-prover-rl, allowing anyone to reproduce our experiments or adapt the setup to their own models and datasets. All information to setup and launch the pipeline can be found in the README of the recipe.
As a result of this training pipeline, we are releasing two models: AI-MO/Kimina-Prover-RL-1.7B, a 1.7B-parameter model that achieves 76.63% Pass@32 on the MiniF2F benchmark — setting a new state of the art for open-source models in this size category
AI-MO/Kimina-Prover-RL-0.6B, a 0.6B-parameter model that achieves 71.30% Pass@32 on the MiniF2F benchmark — also setting a new state of the art for open-source models in this size category. Introduction kimina-prover-rl i]]></description>

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/filbench</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles FilBench What did we learn from FilBench? Finding #1: Although region-specific LLMs still lag behind GPT-4, collecting data to train these models is still a promising direction Finding #2: Filipino translation is still a difficult task for LLMs Finding #3: Open LLMs Remain a Cost-Effective Choice for Filipino Language Tasks Does your LLM work on Philippine Languages? Try it on FilBench! Acknowledgements Citation As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our lives, it becomes crucial to assess whether they reflect the nuances and capabilities of specific language communities.
For example, Filipinos are among the most active ChatGPT users globally, ranking fourth in ChatGPT traffic (behind the United States, India, and Brazil [1] [2]), but despite this strong usage, we lack a clear understanding of how LLMs perform for their languages, such as Tagalog and Cebuano.
Most of the existing evidence is anecdotal, such as screenshots of ChatGPT responding in Filipino as proof that it is fluent.
What we need instead is a systematic evaluation of LLM capabilities in Philippine languages. That’s why we developed FilBench: a comprehensive evaluation suite to assess the capabilities of LLMs for Tagalog, Filipino (the standardized form of Tagalog), and Cebuano, on fluency, linguistic and translati]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles TL;DR Table of Contents Why TimeScope? Motivating a Better Benchmark for Video Benchmark Design 1. Localized Retrieval 2. Information Synthesis 3. Fine-Grained Temporal Perception Evaluations &amp; Leaderboard What did we learn? Conclusion – Let’s Raise the Bar for Long-Video AI TL;DR TimeScope is an open-source benchmark designed to measure how well vision-language models understand long videos. By adding short “needle” clips into videos ranging from 1 minute to 8 hours, it evaluates three skills: localized retrieval, information synthesis, fine-grained temporal perception. Timescope reveals that many state-of-the-art models still struggle with true temporal comprehension. Table of Contents Why TimeScope?
Benchmark Design
Baseline Evaluation Results
Open-Sourcing Recent advances in multimodal AI have produced models claiming to understand hour-long videos. This trend mirrors progress in long-context language models, which excel at reasoning over lengthy text. Following this, vision-language systems now advertise context windows that can handle thousands of frames. But these claims require a closer look: do these models truly demonstrate understanding of the sequence of events? Are they limited to surface-level retrieval \ recognition? It's crucial to ask if their capabilities are being overstat]]></description>

      <link>https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio-mcp-updates</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back to Articles Seamless Local File Support Real-time Progress Notifications Transform OpenAPI Specs to MCP in One Line Improvements to Authentication Modifying Tool Descriptions Conclusion Gradio is an open-source Python package for creating AI-powered web applications. Gradio is compliant with the MCP server protocol and powers thousands of MCP servers hosted on Hugging Face Spaces. The Gradio team is betting big on Gradio and Spaces being the best way to build and host AI-powered MCP servers.
To that end, here are some of the big improvements we've added to Gradio MCP servers as of version 5.38.0. Seamless Local File Support If you've tried to use a remote Gradio MCP server that takes a file as input (image, video, audio), you've probably encountered this error:
This happens because the Gradio server is hosted on a different machine, meaning any input files must be accessible via a public URL so they can be downloaded remotely.
While many ways exist to host files online, they all add a manual step to your workflow. In the age of LLM agents, shouldn't we expect them to handle this for you?
Gradio now includes a "File Upload" MCP server that agents can use to upload files directly to your Gradio application. If any tools in your Gradio MCP server require file inputs, the connection documentation will now show you how to start the "File Upload"]]></description>

Turns out, a state-of-the-art decoder language model that beats Llama 3.2 1B and SmolLM2! We introduce a new open-data training recipe to reproduce the encoder-only ModernBERT model (and actually beat it!). We then apply the exact same recipe to decoder-only models. For the first time, we have two state-of-the-art models trained in the same setup but with two different training objectives: masked language modeling (MLM), and causal language modeling (CLM).
This blog post introduces Ettin, the first suite of SoTA paired encoder-only and decoder-only models (17M-1B params) trained with identical data (2T tokens), architecture, and training recipes. Ettin e]]></description>

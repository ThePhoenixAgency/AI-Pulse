      <title><![CDATA[Money no longer matters to AI’s top talent]]></title>
      <link>https://www.theverge.com/podcast/880778/ai-talent-war-hiring-frenzy-openai-anthropic-ipo</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Today on Decoder we’re going to talk about the war for AI talent. Right now, the hottest job market on the planet is for AI researchers.
The vast majority of these people are concentrated into a small number of hugely valuable, extremely fast-growing companies in the San Francisco Bay Area. Nowadays, such companies are paying some of the highest salaries in the history of the tech industry to poach researchers from one another.
It feels like every time one of these AI researchers leaves one company for another, they tell us exactly why. Sometimes they’re simply resigning to go be a poet. Sometimes they’re chasing a mission. Sometimes they’re worried that AI is going to imperil humanity, destroy all jobs, and plunge the world into chaos. Verge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Decoder wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here. They’re really saying these things. They’re publishing these notes on X, in blog posts, or in the case of one former OpenAI safety researcher by writing a full New York Times op-ed. I’ve been dying to really dig in and try to unpack what’s going on with all these talent moves in AI. So my guest today is Verge senior AI reporter Hayden Field, who’s been covering the revolving door of the AI industry really closely and also the broader culture that’s motivating the AI workers to jump ship and the companies that are ruthlessly trying to hire them.
Those motivations vary. Sure, all these people are paid extravagant salaries, but as you’ll hear Hayden say, a stronger motivating force is ideology and mission. The people working on AI, by and large, believe that what they’re doing is going to radically change the world, and they’re not really in desperate need of more money. So that really changes the incentive structures that might push people to leave, say, OpenAI for Anthropic, or to quit Elon Musk’s xAI now that it’s been acquired by SpaceX.
At the same time, the incentives of the AI companies themselves are going from raising money to making money. Reporting suggests OpenAI and maybe even Anthropic could go public this year, and doing so would create a historic amount of wealth. It would also put new kinds of pressure on these companies to be more transparent about how they spend money and to be much more accountable for returning on the huge investments that they’ve raised so far.
There’s a lot in this conversation. The AI industry right now is full of drama. There’s big characters, bitter rivalries, lots of money, and really, really long blog posts about the end of the world. If you’d like to about what we discussed in this episode, check out these links:

      <link>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/881030/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-controller-lego-mario-yoshi-deal-sale</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Many modern gamepads have adopted a modular design in recent years, from the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded to Hyperkin’s clamp-on X5 Alteron for the Nintendo Switch. However, few of them are quite as innovative as last year’s Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot, which is now on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for an all-time low of $99.99 ($40 off).
Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot Where to Buy: $139.99 $99.99 at Amazon $139.99 $99.99 at Best Buy $139.99 at Turtle Beach The defining feature of the Stealth Pivot doesn’t lie with its drift-free Hall effects sticks or its built-in social notifications — though, those are nice additions. The controller’s main selling factor is a pair of rotating modules, which, when depressed and swiveled, turn an otherwise traditional button and thumbstick layout into one better fit for tackling retro titles and fighting games. You also get a set of programmable back buttons, adjustable trigger stops for a more customized feel, a 3.5mm jack, and the ability to save up to five distinct profiles on the fly.
As for compatibility, the Stealth Pivot works wirelessly with PC using the included 2.4GHz wireless transmitter, or via Bluetooth, which also lets you connect it to mobile devices and select smart TVs. Battery life is limited to about 20 hours per charge, though you can also use it with Xbox consoles via a wired connection, making it even more versatile.
More ways to save today
Lego’s Mario and Yoshi set is currently on sale at Amazon and Target for a $103.99 ($26 off), matching its best price to date. The 15-inch, 1,215-piece kit looks to be a pretty faithful recreation of the 16-bit sprites used in Super Mario World, which, with the help of a hand crank, move to replicate Yoshi’s original running animation. It’s pretty clever, even if the 2D creation will spend most of the time on your shelf with its various mechanisms hidden from view.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[GE is showing off prototypes of its new compact nugget ice maker at the KBIS trade show. | Image: GE GE has announced two new versions of its popular Opal nugget ice machines with smaller footprints that take up less counter space, and more affordable price tags. Like GE's larger and pricier Opal 2.0 Ultra, the two new machines make nugget ice - frequently also referred to as chewable ice, or pellet ice - by freezing layers of ice flakes producing nuggets that are easier to chew with more surface area to cool drinks faster.
Previously only available in restaurants, GE launched its first Opal machine for making ice nuggets at home back in 2015. Recent models, like the Opal 2.0 Ultra, start at a steep $579, but the new GE Profile Opal Mini i …

Unlike most other social platforms, Mastodon has hundreds of independent servers users can join, catering to different communities and niches.

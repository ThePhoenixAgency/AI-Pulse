      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple’s MacBook lineup could be in for a major shakeup. The company is reportedly planning on releasing a new, low-cost laptop that can compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops in the budget market. Such a laptop could bring the Mac to a whole new class of users.
The new MacBook may feature an aluminum design in playful colors, an A19 Pro chip, Ultra Retina XDR OLED display, fewer ports, and Apple’s C2 modem. This new, low-cost MacBook could be a very popular one, which means you’ll want to keep track of its developments. Well, look no further. This article will keep track of the rumors and reports of this upcoming product, as well as offer our perspective on the device, so keep an eye on this page for the latest. New A19 MacBook: Release date
March 4, 2026 – possible Apple is scheduled to host three “Apple Special Experiences” on March 4 in the U.S., U.K., and China. These sessions, which are expected to offer media hands-on time with new products, could provide the ideal setting for the budget MacBook’s debut.
Apple’s low-cost MacBook has been rumored for some time, with Apple leaker Jon Prosser describing a new colorful MacBook Air back in May 2021, that never materialised, but over the past year rumors have remerged suggesting that Apple does have something different coming. In June 2025, credible analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, indicated (in Chinese) that Apple would start production of the new low-cost MacBook at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025 or in the early stage of the first quarter of 2026. It’s worth emphasising that those dates refer to the manufacturing process rather than the announcement or shipping timeframe. If production began in October 2025 then it’s plausible that the budget MacBook will arrive in early 2026, potentially unveiled at a spring event, or in the run up to Apple’s March 4 ‘Experience’. In November, 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning to release a “low-cost laptop to rival Chromebooks and Windows PCs” in the first half of 2026. He said it was currently in testing at Apple and “in early production with overseas suppliers.”
On February 8, 2026, Gurman reported that the low-cost MacBook will be available “in the first half of the year.” He did not offer any specifics. And then, on February 15, he wrote that Apple’s long-rumored low-cost MacBook is expected to arrive “as early as March,” with a design that defies its price tag. What will the new MacBook be called? MacBook (probably)
No reports have been made about the official name of the laptop, but you can assume it won’t be part of the MacBook Air line. It’s being referred to as the A18 or A19 Pro MacBook, based on the chip it could have. Apple could simply call it “MacBook,” reviving the name of the discontinued 12-inch MacBook that was targeted at a similar market. Apple last updated the MacBook in 2017.
Foundry New A19 MacBook: Design
Playful colors
Aluminum chassis (not plastic) According to Mark Gurman (in February 2026), Apple’s low-cost MacBook will have a design that defies its price tag. Apple’s goal with this laptop is to make it affordable compared to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, and one way to cut costs is to make a plastic case instead of an aluminum one. However, since Apple is working to make its products carbon-neutral, it’s doubtful that it would use plastic, preferring to use aluminum or some other recyclable or carbon-free material. Therefore, it is no surprise that the new MacBook, according to Gurman, will have an aluminum chassis. There will be a new manufacturing process “designed to be both faster and more cost-effective than the one used with Apple’s current laptops,” according to Gurman. Along with the aluminum shell, Gurman reports that the new MacBook will be available in “playful colors.”
The following colours are indicated: yellow, light green, blue, silver, dark gray, and pink. Which, in the case of yellow, green and blue, does seem to match the logo Apple designed for the invites to the special events on March 4. Apple Back in June 2023 analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested the following colors: silver, blue, pink, and yellow. A19 Pro MacBook: Display
12.9-inch display – rumored
Apple currently uses a Liquid Retina (LED-backlit display with IPS technology) display in the MacBook Air, an upgrade over the original Retina displays Apple last used with the 13-inch MacBook Pro in 2022. It’s possible Apple could revert to a Retina display with squared-off corners for the A19 Pro MacBook, though it’s more likely that Apple shaves cost by using a smaller display.
On August 11, DigiTimes reported that the laptop will have a 12.9-inch display, slightly smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air. New A19 MacBook: Processor
iPhone chip: A19 Pro or A18 Pro – expected
Another way to meet the pricing goals for this new MacBook is to use a chip that isn’t as robust as the chips used in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. When Kuo first discussed the budget MacBook in his June 2025 report, he stated that Apple will use an A18 Pro, the same chip that was in the iPhone 16 Pro. Now that the A19 arrived with the iPhone 17 this is probably the more likely chip. about what the iPhone 17 can tell us about the MacBook that could use the same chip in: Is Apple’s rumored cheap MacBook hiding in plain sight? The A-series chips are used in iPhones, while M-series chips are in Macs. Both chip families are based on the same general architecture, but the M chips generally offer more processing power.
An A19 Pro (and A18 Pro) can technically do everything an M-series chip can, but it will be slower. When comparing Geekbench 6 benchmarks, the A18 Pro offered single-core performance that’s on par with the M3. However, because the A18 Pro has only 6 CPU cores, its multi-core performance is slightly behind the M1, which has 8 CPU cores. If Apple keeps everything the same, an A18 Pro MacBook will perform like an M1 MacBook Air, which, for a lot of people, has more than enough processing power. Should Apple use an A19 Pro we can expect something even better. It will draw comparison with the iPad models that are powered by Mac chips, though. MacRumors reported, in December 2025, that references to an A18 Pro MacBook appeared in a set of leaked Apple files.
New A19 MacBook: Connectivity
Apple is using its own wireless networking chip, the N1 in the iPhone 17, bringing Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 7, and Thread. It’s likely the same chips will make their way into the A19 Pro MacBook. There’s also a chance this new Mac will have cellular connectivity using Apple’s C1, C1X or yet to launch C2 modem. The C2 is likely to support mmWave. Aside from this, it’s rumored that the budget MacBook will have fewer USB ports than the MacBook Air (which has two USB-C and a magsafe charging port). This low-cost MacBook may not support Thunderbolt. New A19 MacBook: Camera
No camera?
It’s also possible that Apple opts not to include a built-in camera. Over the past several years, Apple has promoted the Mac’s Continuity Camera feature that lets you use an iPhone as a Mac webcam, as well as the upcoming macOS Tahoe Magnifier app. Apple could promote this as a webcam solution. This would be a drastic change, since it’s been a long time since Apple shipped a laptop without a camera, but it could be a possibility in order to meet the company’s price goal. New A19 MacBook: Performance Results are expressed as Geekbench scores. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. We don’t yet have the benchmarks for the A19 Pro, but the A18 Pro has 8GB of RAM, which Apple has said is the bare minimum required to run Apple Intelligence features. So, this new laptop will have at least 8GB of RAM and possibly 16GB, like the other MacBook models. Since the iPhone doesn’t offer RAM upgrades, we don’t know what Apple could charge for extra memory.
As for graphics performance, the A18 Pro has a 6-core GPU, and its Metal score in Geekbench 6’s Compute benchmark is similar to that of the M1 found in the MacBook Air. It’s not a cutting-edge performer, but it’ll handle everyday tasks without any issues. Since Apple’s other MacBooks all start at 256GB of storage, it’s nearly certain this model will come with 256GB of storage as well. New A19 MacBook: Price
The cheapest laptop Apple sells is the $999 MacBook Air. However, Walmart still sells the M1 MacBook Air with a 256GB SSD for $649 and as low as $599. The A19 Pro MacBook has been thought of as a replacement for this Walmart model, though it’s hard to believe it would be that cheap. A price that falls between $729 and $849 seems like it would fit into the MacBook lineup.
There are claims that the low-cost MacBook could start at $599, which could allow Apple to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops. Gurman reports that the new laptop will cost “well under $1,000.”
Our estimation would be around the middle of those two figures, around $749. @macworld.com A cheap MacBook…or something else. A rumor says that Apple is going to release a cheap laptop, but what if it’s actually the long-rumored iPad/Mac hybrid we’ve heard about?

Authorities said the group maintained contact with rescuers for roughly four hours despite having no cellular coverage in backcountry terrain. The rescue offers a clear real-world example of Apple's satellite emergency system in a life-threatening situation.
An avalanche hit a guided ski group in Nevada County, California, near Lake Tahoe, leaving six survivors stranded without cell service. They managed to contact rescuers using Apple's Emergency SOS feature on the iPhone and a separate emergency beacon. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066138/no-apple-wont-drop-usb-c-from-the-iphone-18.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Most iPhone fans are currently focused on the imminent launch of the iPhone 17e, which could be here in a matter of days. But one dubious rumor doing the rounds on social media right now concerns a flagship phone from the next generation. It’s just a shame that it’s almost certainly wrong.
This TikTok video, which at the time of writing has been viewed more than 17 million times, purports to show the charging port of the iPhone 18. (Or “iPhone18,” as it’s labelled by the clearly knowledgeable maker.) But rather than the USB-C port, which has been used on all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 15 in 2023, the animation shows something more akin to the MagSafe connector that appears on newer MacBooks. This video might look cool, but it’s not going to happen. TikTok The charging cable, which has a rather nice black braided cord, attaches via a magnetic connection. When it’s in place a green LED lights up on the charger head, and a small green lightning bolt is shown at the bottom of the previously blank phone screen. (Never mind that iPhones don’t behave like this; it’s the least of our worries.) It looks very similar to the MagSafe cable on my 2021 MacBook Pro, except with three pins instead of five and a chunkier body.
Now, the video doesn’t list its sources; we don’t get the usual “supply-chain sources” or “people with knowledge of the matter.” It’s just an animation. So in some ways it’s quite difficult to refute: where did this information come from? Who said this was likely? Is this simply a concept that an illustrator dreamed up, like this animation from the same channel showing possible iPhone 18 Pro colors?
Whatever the video’s intention, it’s getting major traction from viewers who think it’s real. A quick browse through a handful of the 9,700-odd reveals viewer after viewer complaining about Apple’s foolishness in doing this, or the impracticality of the design. A few appear to be Android fans mocking iPhone users for their misfortune. I couldn’t find any pointing out that this is extraordinarily unlikely to happen.
Because, as several commenters argue, it wouldn’t be a practical solution. It would disconnect very easily, and unlike on the MacBook, disconnecting easily isn’t necessary to protect it from a specific type of accident. It would annoy customers and accessories makers. And it could create problems with the EU, who mandated USB-C connectors on all smartphones sold in its territory.
What may have happened is that someone has got confused between MagSafe on the iPhone and MagSafe on the Mac. They’re both charging standards that use a magnetic connection to keep the charging points in place, but in most other respects they’re totally different. (For example, the phone’s magnetic connection is stronger so that it remains connected if you nudge the device, whereas the laptop is designed to detach if you trip on the wire.) The iPhone 17 already has the phone version of MagSafe, and the iPhone 18 will too, but that doesn’t mean it will have the Mac version as well. If nothing else, it would be enormously confusing.
Whereas the iPhone 17e is expected to be here in time for Apple’s “experience” on March 4, the first 18-series iPhones won’t arrive until September. And the actual iPhone 18, the cheaper baseline model, might not turn up until the following spring.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/apple-watch-15-tips-need-to-know/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple Watch is now eleven generations in, and packed with useful features that are easy to miss at first glance. To help you get more out of your new device, we've rounded up 15 practical tips you might not have discovered yet, including a few that long-time users often overlook. Bounce Between Two Apps On your Apple Watch, double-press the Digital Crown to see a deck of all currently open apps, and turn it to scroll through them. From this view, you can jump back to the last app you were using. Simply tap on an app screen to switch to it, or swipe left on its card and tap the red X button to quit it. Switch App Views If the app grid feels messy, switch to List View. Open the Watch app on iPhone, tap App View, and choose List View. From then on, pressing the Digital Crown will show your apps in a simple, scrollable list. Rearrange Apps You can rearrange your apps so that the ones you use most are closer to hand. Simply press and hold on any app in the grid view, then drag it where you want. Alternatively, open the Watch app on your iPhone, go to App View ➝ Arrangement, and move things around there instead. Ping Your iPhone If you've misplaced your iPhone but you're sure it's nearby, open Control Center with a press of the Side button, then tap the phone icon to make it ping. Press and hold that icon and the iPhone's camera flash will blink too, which can help if it's hidden under something. Skip the Countdown If you're eager to start a workout, the three-second countdown before it starts can be skipped. Just tap the screen when the countdown begins and your workout will start immediately. If you find yourself doing this regularly, consider turning on Precision Start in Settings ➝ Workout. Customize Vibration Strength If you keep missing notifications, go to Settings ➝ Sounds &amp; Haptics ➝ and change from Default to Prominent. This adds an extra tap pattern before alerts so they're harder to ignore. Perform Precision Timing The Chronograph Pro watch face transforms into an actual chronograph. Tap the outer edge surrounding the main 12-hour dial on this watch face to record time on scales of 60, 30, 6, or 3 seconds. Alternatively, select the tachymeter timescale to measure speed based on time travel over a fixed distance. Jump to the Top If you've scrolled way down in an app and want to jump back to the top, just tap the time in the top corner of the screen. It works in most apps and saves a lot of scrolling. Remove Apps Clearing out apps you don't use on your Apple Watch is easy. In the List or Grid View, press and hold on the screen until the apps jiggle, then tap the small x in the corner of the app icon to delete it. This works for most system apps and all third-party apps. Customize Control Center By default, Control Center (accessed via the Side button) gives you quick access to things like Wi-Fi, battery, and Do Not Disturb. But it's worth seeing what else you can add to it that you'd like quick access to. Tap the Edit button at the bottom, then tap the + icon in the top-left corner of the screen. System options such as New Note and Lights are particularly handy, and you might see some third-party options listed too, depending on your installed apps. Speak the Time Out Loud If you're using the Mickey or Minnie watch face, tap on the character and they'll speak the time out loud. Just make sure your sound is turned on. In fact, you can also have Siri read the time on any watch face by tapping and holding with two fingers on the display. Again though, sound needs to be enabled. Customize Smart Replies Smart Replies are handy when you want to reply with just a few words. In the Watch app on iPhone, go to Messages and tap Default Replies to customise what shows up. Then when a message comes in, simply swipe down to pick one of your preset replies. Pause Activity Rings Feeling unwell but hoping to keep your streak intact? In the Activity app, select your rings to access the option to suspend them for the day, or set a pause that lasts until a chosen date up to 90 days ahead. Create a Note In the new Notes app in watchOS 26, you can't modify existing notes on Apple Watch, but you can create a new one by tapping the compose control in the bottom-right corner and speaking your text. Because Notes sync through iCloud, you can refine or reorganize everything later on a device with a physical or on-screen keyboard.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/c1x-modem-faces-first-failure/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[A reported hardware failure affecting Apple's new in-house C1X 5G modem in the iPhone Air has surfaced online, marking the first known real-world incident involving the company's own baseband technology. The ‌iPhone Air‌ is the first iPhone model to ship with the Apple's internally designed C1X 5G modem, replacing Qualcomm's X75 modem used across the iPhone 16 lineup. The transition to Apple-designed modems follows years of development after Apple acquired Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019 and began building its own baseband engineering teams and intellectual property portfolio with the goal of reducing reliance on Qualcomm and increasing efficiency. support thread on Reddit spotted by Wccftech, where the user "itstheskylion" described waking up to find the device had completely lost cellular reception. According to the user, the phone displayed no signal bars and diagnostics indicated a hardware-level cellular problem. The device had reportedly been kept in a case since purchase and showed no signs of physical damage. The user said that multiple troubleshooting steps were attempted, including restarting the device, performing a soft reset, and resetting network settings, but none restored cellular connectivity. The user also reported using a dual-SIM configuration with two different carriers, with neither connection functioning, which suggests the issue was not related to a carrier outage or network-specific disruption. Baseband hardware failures are uncommon in modern smartphones due to extensive factory testing and validation processes, but large-scale production inevitably includes a small percentage of defective units. Apple has historically replaced and collected devices that exhibit unusual behavior for internal analysis, particularly when new technologies are involved. At present, there is no evidence that the issue is widespread or indicative of a broader reliability concern. iPhone 18 Pro, ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max, and foldable ‌iPhone‌ are rumored to feature Apple's next-generation C2 modem.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/2881175/iphone-17e-release-date-specs-features-price.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple launched a new series of iPhones at the end of 2025: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, as well as a brand new iPhone Air, but there was no new iPhone 17e for those hoping for an update to the budget iPhone.
This wasn’t a surprise: Apple released the iPhone 16e in February 2025 to replace the iPhone SE, so an update to the iPhone “e” series phones wasn’t expected to arrive until early 2026.
If you’re considering buying an iPhone 17e, this is the place to keep up to date on its development. We’ll keep track of the latest reports and provide our analysis to help you decide if the iPhone 17e is the right phone for you.
What’s new since the last update to this article: It’s a year since the iPhone 16e launch on February 19 2025, will the iPhone 17e arrive today? Probably not, but it’s likely to arrive before, or on, March 4. At a glance: iPhone 17e vs iPhone 16e Specification / FeatureiPhone 16eiPhone 17e Launch / ReleaseFebruary 2025March 4 (Possible)

March 4 launch – possible The iPhone 16e arrived on February 19, 2025, so there was some hope that Apple could introduce its replacement on February 19 a year later… With that date now here it’s looking unlikely. However, there is an “Apple Special Experience” coming up on March 4, 2026, with media being invited to meet Apple execs in at least three global locations. It’s generally thought these meetings will tie to new Apple product launches. There are a number of other new product launches expected including a refreshed iPad Air, new entry-level iPad, M5 MacBook Air, M5 Pro/MaxMacBook Pro, and a brand new low cost MacBook.
An event on March 4 – even if Apple isn’t referring to it as an event – is good timing for Apple to launch the new iPhone 17e because it is right in the middle of the Mobile World Congress. According to various reports, the iPhone 17e has entered test production runs to prepare it for a spring 2026 release.
A rumor in early January said the iPhone 17e will go into production following CES (which ended January 9). This is unsurprising, as it follows the same pattern as the iPhone 16e. iPhone 17e: Specs: What’s new for the iPhone 17e
A19 with one fewer GPU than iPhone 17 – likely
MagSafe support – likely
C1X modem – possible
256GB SSD – possible
Apple’s decision to introduce the iPhone 16e in February 2025 represented a significant shift in its product strategy, moving away from the sporadic release cycle of the iPhone SE toward a more predictable, annual “e-series” lineup. This transition was driven by several strategic imperatives, ranging from the necessity of supporting new AI technologies to the desire to test in-house hardware components in a lower-risk environment. To maintain a starting price of $599 while including the high-end A18 chip, Apple made several calculated omissions that differentiate the 16e from the standard iPhone 16. The iPhone 17e is expected to address some of the shortcomings of the iPhone 16e with a few key design refinements (a Dynamic Island is rumored), more storage at the entry-level, MagSafe support and an updated processor (the A19).
Processor: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and others have reported that the iPhone 17e will have an A19 chip, which is no real surprise. If this is the case, it may be a slightly less powerful than the A19 chip used by the iPhone 17. Apple uses binned chips in the “e” series, so Tte A18 in the iPhone 16e has one fewer GPU core than the A18 in the standard iPhone 16; and the A19 in the iPhone 17e will likely have one fewer GPU core than the iPhone 17.
MagSafe: A December 2025 report in The Information claimed that Apple will add MagSafe support to the iPhone 17e, one of the features that is notably missing from the 16e. When we reviewed the 16e, the lack of MagSafe was one of its major shortcomings. A Macworld source in February 2026 claimed that the iPhone 17e will feature 25W MagSafe wireless charging.
Modem: Apple’s C1 modem first appeared in the iPhone 16e, and rumors suggest the iPhone 17e will use the same modem. However, it could take the newer C1X modem as found in the iPhone 17 series, which is apparently two times faster than the C1 while using 30% less energy.
Storage: There are suggestions that the iPhone 17e could follow the iPhone 17 with 256GB at the starting point, up from 128GB. However, in February 2026 Apple leaker, John Prosser said he expects the baseline storage to stay at 128GB. iPhone 17e: How the iPhone 17e display will be different
Dynamic Island instead of notch – possible Notch vs Dynamic Island.
David Price / Foundry Screen size: The iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch screen, which is larger than that of the iPhone 16 (6.1-inch). The iPhone 17e is not expected to get a bigger screen. It will likely sport a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate, the same as the iPhone 16e. Dynamic Island: Digital Chat Station reported in August 2025 that the display will have a Dynamic Island – a change from the notch on the iPhone 16e.
OLED: In December 2025, Korean website, The Elec reported that BOE will provide OLED displays to Apple for the iPhone 17e. BOE also provided OLEDs for the iPhone 16e. Samsung Display and LG Display are expected to also provide 17e displays. Bezels: The display, according to The Elec, will have thinner bezels than the 16e. iPhone 17e: Cameras
18MP front camera with square sensor – likely
The iPhone 17e will likely continue to have a single 48MP camera on the back but the 12MP camera on the front (as seen on the iPhone 16e) could get an update in line with the iPhone 17 series). The front-facing cameras across the iPhone 17 range have all been updated to 18MP, so it is possible that the iPhone 17e will see the same update to the selfie camera. If so, it will also include a square sensor capable of taking photos in any orientation without requiring the user to rotate the phone. The notch may be replaced by the Dynamic Island in the iPhone 17e. Foundry | Alex Walker-Todd iPhone 17e: Design &amp; Colors
Digital Island likely to be only visible external change
Colors: There have been no reports relating to the iPhone 17e’s colors. The iPhone 16e is available in black or white, and we expect the same for the iPhone 17e.
Design: No changes are expected for the design, although, as mentioned above, the new iPhone 17e could have a Digital Island instead of the notch at the top of the screen. There is a possibility that the there could be thinner bezels than the 16e, according to The Elec. iPhone 17e: Price
Starting at $599
A January 2026 report on Wccftech suggests that Apple has been able to reduce costs for the new iPhone 17e, so that the price won’t increase. This is thanks to lower costs for the OLED panels Apple is using. The iPhone 16e starts at $599/£599, and Apple is expected to price the iPhone 17e at $599 as well, though no reports have been made so far. Tariffs and production cost increases may affect the price, but since the “e” series is considered Apple’s lowest-priced iPhone, the price would not exceed that of the iPhone 17, which starts at $799, and the iPhone 16, whose price has been reduced to start at $699.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/meta-revives-smartwatch-plans-this-year/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Meta is set to release its first smartwatch this year featuring health-tracking and built-in Meta AI, reports The Information. The smartwatch, which would compete directly with Apple Watch and other brands, is the result of a revived project that Meta canceled in 2022 amid broader spending cuts at its Reality Labs hardware division. The original project involved plans to release three different camera-equipped watch models, but it doesn't sound like they will be part of the company's future product lineup. The new watch is code-named "Malibu 2." include facial recognition – and it sounds like they will almost definitely appear before a pair of mixed reality glasses that the company has also been developing. Internally code-named "Phoenix," the MR glasses are said to have been delayed until 2027. Meta executives are said to have grown concerned that launching too many devices in quick succession could confuse customers, hence the delay. Last year, the Facebook parent company launched its Ray-Ban Display AR glasses, which apparently proved so popular that Meta had to delay an international rollout. Those glasses use a neural wristband for its gestural interface, so it's possible the new smartwatch could potentially take over those controls. Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is developing rival smart glasses, an AI pin, and AirPods with cameras, all of which will connect to the iPhone and will interface with the smarter version of Siri that's in the works.

      <title><![CDATA[ChatGPT is your iPhone’s secret superpower]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3026151/chatgpt-is-your-iphones-secret-superpower.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld AI is rapidly being integrated into the hardware and services we depend on, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. While Apple’s in-house AI models remain relatively limited for now, Apple users have other options: most appealingly, the company has natively baked OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT into its systems. This enables you to easily fetch up-to-date information, polish text, generate images, and much more.
If you’re not already using AI to accelerate your everyday workflows, it’s time to get with the program. Try these 10 ChatGPT features on your Apple devices of choice, and watch your productivity skyrocket.
Applets
OpenAI recently launched ChatGPT apps as a way to access your favorite services using text prompts. The feature is available in the latest ChatGPT app across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and the web. To get started, you can visit the Apps section in ChatGPT settings and connect the accounts you’re interested in.
For example, the Apple Music applet lets you find songs, generate playlists, and add them to your library right from ChatGPT. Similarly, the Adobe Acrobat offering enables you to upload a PDF document and make certain tweaks using the chatbot’s interface.
As you’d probably expect, the functionality of these apps is somewhat limited. They’re cut-down versions of the full app, a little like Apple’s App Clips, and more advanced workflows will still require the use of the real thing. But they’re solid for performing specific, quick tasks using natural language. There wasn’t much AI in the 90s, but we made up for it with our indie music. Mahmoud Itani / Foundry macOS assistance
ChatGPT’s integration with apps isn’t confined to the limited range of applets available on the platform itself. If you’ve installed the official client on your Mac, you’ll be able to link it to active macOS app sessions and ask relevant questions.
Simply tap on the App Store icon in the ChatGPT app’s text box to view a list of compatible, installed apps. If you pick Terminal, for instance, it will read the commands you’re entering and help you type the correct ones to achieve a certain aim. Likewise, it can view the notes you’re typing and suggest edits based on your prompt.
Quick access
Locate the ChatGPT app on your Home Screen can be inefficient when performing time-sensitive tasks. Fortunately, ChatGPT offers a ton of shortcuts to quickly summon it on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
On iOS and iPadOS, you can add ChatGPT controls to the Control Center and Lock Screen, letting you quickly initiate a new session from different parts of the system; on newer iPhones, you can also have the Action button launch a ChatGPT instance. On the Mac, you can hit Option and Space to reveal a miniature ChatGPT text box to enter your prompts, connect apps, upload files, and so on. You can also add ChatGPT to shortcuts you create in the Apple Shortcuts app and have it analyze input or fetch requested data.
Siri fallback
Siri often fails to answer basic questions and instead redirects users to web results. If you’ve enabled Apple Intelligence, however, the voice assistant can now tap into ChatGPT’s intellect instead. To turn this on, open the Settings app, go to Apple Intelligence and Siri &gt; ChatGPT, and enable the Use ChatGPT toggle. (You can also turn off the Confirm Requests option if you’d rather not have Siri ask for your permission every time it needs to share a text prompt with ChatGPT’s servers.) Now, you can command Siri to ask ChatGPT any question, and it’ll read aloud the response it receives.
Writing Tools
This neat text editing suite allows you to natively proofread, rewrite, summarize, and change the tone of selected text. Thanks to ChatGPT, the feature also lets you apply custom edits or generate text from scratch. Just select the text you’d like to edit, then hit Writing Tools, followed by Compose. You can then describe the changes you’d like to make and ChatGPT will handle the rest. ChatGPT offers a range of preset styles when generating images.
Mahmoud Itani / Foundry Image Playground
Image Playground is Apple’s own AI image generator, featuring multiple illustration styles, doodle polishing support, offline access, and more. To elevate the quality of outputted images, you can rely on ChatGPT’s superior image generation models without leaving the app. Click the Styles dropdown menu in the Playground app on iOS, iPadOS, or macOS, then select ChatGPT. You can then pick a more specific style, such as Anime, Vector, or Oil Painting. Now you can type your prompt or add some of the suggested ones and wait for the result to appear.
Paid perks and data sync
Using ChatGPT integration on your Apple devices comes with daily limits that, when exceeded, prevent you from uploading files, generating images, and accessing advanced models. If you’re subscribed to ChatGPT Go, Plus, or Pro, you can link your paid account to extend or remove said limits. In Settings, go to Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri &gt; ChatGPT, and sign in with your OpenAI account. This will also sync the conversations you have with ChatGPT via Siri and show them in your chat history.
Group chats
Lastly, if you’re planning an event or working on a project with others, you can create a group chat in the ChatGPT app. To get started, tap on the dedicated button in the top-right corner of a ChatGPT conversation and share the link with your friends or coworkers. This lets you all brainstorm together and have ChatGPT share its knowledge whenever needed. ChatGPT can contribute to group chats.
Mahmoud Itani / Foundry Shopping advice
Picking the right model when upgrading your Apple device can be confusing for tech newbies. Obviously, Macworld should be your first stop when seeking iPhone, iPad, or Mac buying advice, but ChatGPT is keen to join the party with its Shopping Research feature.
Select the relevant mode in the ChatGPT app and describe the product you’re looking to buy. ChatGPT will ask follow-up questions related to budget and performance expectations to narrow down your options, then display results comparing the prices, specs, images, and other relevant aspects of the matching devices. You can then choose one of them and buy it through your favorite online retailer.
Understanding your iDevices
ChatGPT can also help tech newbies learn more about their Apple devices and the latest OS features. Again, Macworld has long been happy to help in this regard, but who are we to stand in the way of progress? It’s far better, clearly, to ask a chatbot.
ChatGPT can, for example, check the latest available OS version for your device and briefly list the top features it introduces using simple language. This helps you familiarize yourself with what’s new, without having to read complex changelogs. Similarly, if you encounter errors when using your Apple devices, you can upload screenshots to ChatGPT or use the video calling mode to show it what’s going on in real time. The chatbot will then suggest solutions or workarounds based on similar issues discussed on online forums. Or beloved Apple-focused websites.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld According to rumors, 2026 is shaping up to be a huge year for the Mac, starting in just a couple of weeks with Apple’s first event (or “experience”) of the year. Along with the usual faster chips, Apple reportedly has new tricks up its sleeve in 2026, with several new features that will have Mac users everywhere saying, “Finally!” Here are four major overdue announcements we expect to arrive this year.
A budget MacBook
iPhone fans have long pined for a truly affordable MacBook priced below the $999 MacBook Air that isn’t just an older model with a cut-rate price. That dream machine may finally arrive in just two short weeks. On March 4, Apple will hold a series of “experiences” in New York, London, and Shanghai, and the star is expected to be the first-ever low-cost MacBook. After tackling the mid-range market with the MacBook Air, Apple reportedly wants to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops, with a new laptop that could be as cheap as $599. Apple will reportedly use an A18 Pro or A19 Pro iPhone chip, and it will likely have a smaller screen than the Air and possibly fewer USB ports. But it will be powerful enough for everyday tasks and light work. For a lot of users, that’s all that’s needed.
MacBooks with OLED displays]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/apple-immersive-f1-vision-pro-march-event/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming March 4 media event could include a demo of immersive Formula 1 content on Apple Vision Pro, Daring Fireball's John Gruber has suggested. The timing appears to be what's sparked the idea. The 2026 F1 season kicks off in Australia on March 8, just four days after the "Apple Experience" set to be held in New York, London, and Shanghai. last October, and the company has already been experimenting with live immersive sports on Vision Pro with a limited slate of Los Angeles Lakers games this season. If Apple has plans to stream F1 races live on Vision Pro with some level of immersion, March 4 would likely be a great opportunity to show it off to the press. To be clear, there are no little birdies tweeting into Gruber's ear on this one – he's quick to acknowledge this is pure speculation shared with him by a reader. "Could just be a total coincidence that the Formula 1 season is starting the weekend after this event," he says. "But it seems worth noting." Apple has said that further details on production and "new ways to enjoy F1 content" across its products will be shared in the coming months. March 4 could fit that timeline nicely, or it could of course be nothing at all. Apple is widely expected to unveil several new products in the near future, including the iPhone 17e, MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, an eighth-generation iPad Air, and a 12th-generation iPad. A refreshed Studio Display and an all-new low-cost MacBook powered by the A18 chip are also possible, alongside updates to the Apple TV and HomePod mini. Tag: John Gruber

If they already have a case, then buy them a new or better one. Just slipping on a new case can transform an old iPhone into something that feels brand new again. It’s even more satisfying than an iOS update!

iPhone Gift Guide: iPhone power banks
Hands up if your iPhone has never run out of juice during the day when you are far from a convenient power socket. Yeah, right.
Apple used to make a special Smart Battery Case for the iPhone but stopped selling these when it added MagSafe magnetic wireless charging to the iPhone 12 and later. It then sold its own MagSafe Battery Case but stopped making these when it launched the iPhone 15. But fear not, as there are some great MagSafe power banks out there that clamp onto the back of your iPhone (12/13/14/15/16/17) and can recharge the phone for long enough that you can reach a power source.
Of course, Macworld has tested many of them and picked the best MagSafe power banks, but here are a few of our favorites. Pros
Huge 10000mAh battery capacity
Built-in USB-C cable
Wireless or 30W wired charging Retailer Price View Deal Product Price The Anker Zolo Magnetic Power Bank is available in four colors—black, blue, pink or white—and uses MagSafe to magnetically stick to the back of your iPhone when you need a power boost. In our tests, it recharged an iPhone twice over with its 10000mAh battery capacity. Better still, it features its own built-in USB-C cable for charging up the battery pack or wired-charging the iPhone 15/16/17 families that have a USB-C port rather than Lightning. Using the cable rather than MagSafe will charge an iPhone 15/16/17 at an impressive 30W. MagSafe wireless charging is slower at 7.5W but it will still rescue a fading iPhone 12 or later—or you can supply your own Lightning cable (or USB-C for iPhone 15 users) and connect with a wire. It also features a handy kickstand. Anker If you have an older (pre-15) iPhone, then you need a Lightning cable but the non-magnetic Anker Zolo Power Bank has both, meaning it will still be relevant when you upgrade to a USB-C iPhone. And of course you can use the USB-C cable to charge the power bank itself. If you have a family with both USB-C (15/16/17) and Lightning (14 and earlier) iPhones this will suit all models. There’s a handy digital battery-level display, too. This version of the Zolo doesn’t feature wireless charging. Anker With no built-in cable but a fast 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging pad, a third option is the Anker MagGo 10K Slim Power Bank (above), which is the slimmest 10K high-capacity wireless power bank we have tested—perfect for carrying with you in a bag for emergencies when your iPhone starts to fade and you are miles from a power socket or have forgotten your charger and cable. Pros
5000mAh battery capacity
Color options
15W wireless or 30W wired charging Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal Product Price This 5K battery pack was the winner for slimmer 5K magnetic power banks in our recharging tests, recharging a faded iPhone 16 Pro by 79%.
Belkin and Amazon offer a choice of colors (It’s available in a range of colors (White, Blue, Sand, Blue, Citrus Yellow, and Gold), and the Apple Store now has an exclusive set of new colors, including a brighter Pink, Deep Purple with a red stand and Teal with a yellow stand
The Belkin’s kickstand is easy to use and feels robust, and the battery pack itself is marginally smaller than the Ugreen. The $49.99 Torras MagStall Power Bank is a little slimmer but wider and boasts a stand/finger-grip, although recharges to a slightly lesser extent. Pros
Fastest 25W wireless or 30W wired charging
5000mAh battery capacity Retailer Price View Deal Product Price This 25W wireless power bank lived up to its claims of wirelessly charging an iPhone 16 Pro from 0% to 50% in 32 minutes—12 to 15 minutes faster than a 15W power bank. That might not sound a lot but when you’re in a rush to charge your phone, every minute counts. 25W wireless charging is limited to the iPhone 16 and 17 families, running at least iOS 26; older iPhones will charge at 15W using this power bank.
The Baseus PicoGo Magnetic 10K Power Bank (AM61) is an output blazer is more ways than one. It is certified Qi 2.2 so charges wirelessly at 25W. The built-in USB-C cable is rated at 45W, which is fast enough to keep even a MacBook going. Pros
Compact iPhone, Watch, AirPods charging stand
10K power bank
Foldable for travel Retailer Price OneAdaptr View Deal Product Price This compact OneGo power bank has it all: it can charge four devices at the same time—including iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods, plus another via its side USB-C port—and then folding up into a lightweight form that can slip into your pocket or overnight bag. iPhone Gift Guide: USB-C iPhone chargers
A simple charger sounds like a boring present but we think any iPhone users would be delighted to receive one of these beauties now that Apple no longer includes one in the box with new iPhones. And which iPhone users couldn’t do with at least one more spare charger at home or in the office—or a special one for travel?
An iPhone charger should be rated at least 20W, and we’d recommend 30W or better as newer iPhones can accept higher wattages than even Apple admits. A 30W charger can handle an iPad Pro and has just enough to power up even a 13-inch MacBook Air.
For more details and options, read our Best Picks roundup of the best iPhone chargers. Further down we recommend some multi-device chargers that might make more of an impact come unwrapping day. Pros

While charging using a USB-C cable (USB-C to Lightning for older iPhones, and USB-C to USB-C for the iPhone 15 and later) from your charger is the fastest way to charge an iPhone, more convenient is wireless charging. Since the iPhone 12, wireless charging has become more efficient and therefore faster with Apple’s MagSafe technology that magnetically clamps the iPhone more securely to the wireless charger.
You can buy a simple USB-C to MagSafe charging pad, like Apple’s $39/£39 MagSafe Charger or a third-party alternative, or a multi-device charger that includes a MagSafe charger for iPhone plus a charger for AirPods or Apple Watch.

If you thought that chargers might be a boring gift, I hope we’ve persuaded you otherwise. But how would you feel unwrapping a charging cable? Me? I’d be delighted as you can’t own enough charging cables, can you? They are always handy. Sure, it’s not a pony or a new TV but it’s easier to wrap.
Older iPhones will need a USB-C to Lightning cable; check out our roundup of the best Lightning cables. Pair one of these with a USB-C charger, see above, for the fastest charging. An older USB-A to Lightning cable doesn’t support iPhone fast charging.

      <description><![CDATA[With iOS 26.4, CarPlay users will be able to use third-party chatbots with ‌CarPlay‌. AI services like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT will be accessible through the ‌CarPlay‌ system for the first time. Apple's ‌CarPlay‌ Developer Guide [PDF] lists voice-based conversational apps as a supported app type starting with iOS 26.4. Apple is implementing a new voice control screen that will let apps provide visual feedback for voice-based conversational apps. AI apps that integrate ‌CarPlay‌ will need to add support for the voice control screen while voice-based services are active. There is a specific entitlement for voice-based conversational apps, and companies that make chatbots will need to update their apps to add ‌CarPlay‌ support. Siri voice controls while in the vehicle. iPhone functions. There also won't be a wake word option to activate a third-party app, so users will still need to open the app to use the chatbot. After an app is launched, the customizable voice control screen will give users vehicle-optimized chatbot experiences. Related Roundups: iOS 26, iPadOS 26

      <title><![CDATA[iOS 26.4's New CarPlay Video Feature Shown in Action]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/ios-26-4-major-new-carplay-feature-revealed/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back at WWDC 2025, Apple revealed that it was planning to allow CarPlay users to watch video via AirPlay in their vehicles while they are not driving, and the first beta of iOS 26.4 suggests the feature may be nearing availability. There are several new references to CarPlay video streaming functionality within the iOS 26.4 beta's source code. The feature is not yet visible to users, but software developer Thomas Dye managed to get it working to some extent in Xcode's CarPlay simulator on the Mac, and he showed it off in a recent YouTube video (via 9to5Mac). On an iPhone connected to CarPlay, it appears that videos in any AirPlay-supported app can be played on the car's display. In the Dynamic Island, there is a button that allows you to show the video on the iPhone instead, when you want to. The demo also reveals that an Apple TV app will be available on CarPlay, allowing you to access shows and movies from the Apple TV streaming service and your own library. There is also a tab for accessing MLS Season Pass. However, it is not entirely clear if the Apple TV app will actually be this fully featured on the real version of CarPlay. The simulator provides an early albeit fairly clunky look at CarPlay's video streaming in action. The feature will likely be available by time iOS 26.4 is released to the general public in late March or early April, but there is a chance it will get held back until iOS 26.5 or later if Apple needs more time to wrap up development. indicates that automakers will need to implement support for the CarPlay video functionality, due to the safety requirement that the vehicle be parked, so it may take some time for the feature to widely roll out.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/iphone-17-pro-max-becomes-most-traded-in-phone/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[New trade-in data indicates that Apple's iPhone 17 Pro Max has rapidly become the single most traded-in smartphone. According to a new report from SellCell, Apple's latest flagship iPhone has quickly risen to the top of the independent trade-in market, accounting for 11.5% of all devices appearing in the top-20 trade-in rankings just months after release. The analysis is based on SellCell internal trade-in data and secondary market pricing trends gathered from 40 independent ‌iPhone‌ buyers. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max's share of the top-20 trade-in rankings increased from about 5.1% in late November to 11.5% by early February, more than doubling in approximately 12 weeks. 86% of traded-in units were categorized as being in mint or good condition, suggesting many owners are selling soon after purchase. iPhone 16 Pro Max and ‌iPhone‌ 13 sit at 7.2% of trade-ins each. The top-20 devices collectively represent around 47% of all trade-in activity. Trade-in rankings typically reflect a wide mix of devices at different points in their lifecycle, with older models often dominating resale volume due to large installed bases and the natural upgrade cycle. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max's rapid rise is therefore notable because the device only entered the market relatively recently yet has already become the most frequently traded-in model across the tracked channels. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max has apparently lost approximately 25.4% of its value since launch when measuring average resale prices for mint-condition devices over a 145-day period. Over an equivalent timeframe, the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max lost roughly 32.5% of its value. This represents more than 7% lower depreciation for the newer model and translates to as much as $95 in additional retained value compared with the previous generation over the same period.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/low-cost-macbook-expected-on-march-4/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple will announce its rumored low-cost MacBook at its event on March 4, with the device coming in a selection of bold color options, according to a known leaker. Earlier this week, Apple announced a "special Apple Experience" for the media in New York, London, and Shanghai, taking place on March 4, 2026 at 9:00am ET. Instant Digital" said that the color scheme of the Apple logo graphic used for the upcoming "Apple Experience" should match the colors of the new entry-level Mac. The invite graphic shows a 3D Apple logo made up of transparent discs in yellow, green, and blue. The post effectively constitutes a claim that the device is set to arrive at the event. In June 2025, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the more-affordable MacBook could come in silver, blue, pink, and yellow finishes, which would match the entry-level iPad. In his latest newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple has tested a range of playful color options for its upcoming low-cost MacBook, going well beyond the muted tones available on its current laptop lineup. Gurman said the colors tested so far include light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray, although he added that it is unlikely all of them will ship. The color palette would make the budget MacBook the most colorful laptop Apple has offered since the iBook G3 era in the late 90s, which included Tangerine, Blueberry, Indigo, Graphite, and Key Lime. iPhone chip, likely the A18 Pro, rather than an M-series processor. It will likely retail for well below $1,000.

      <title><![CDATA[10 Reasons to Wait for Apple's iPhone 18 Pro]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/reasons-to-wait-iphone-18-pro/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max. One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle this year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027. Overall Design iPhone 17 Pro Style Rumors suggest the iPhone 18 Pro lineup will largely retain the same design as the iPhone 17 Pro models. The rear camera system will look identical to the current generation, featuring a raised "plateau" with three lenses arranged in a triangle. Display sizes are also expected to remain unchanged, with the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max continuing to use 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch panels, respectively – the same dimensions introduced with the iPhone 16 Pro series. iPhone 18 Pro models could drop the current two-tone look of the rear casing found on the iPhone 17 Pro in favor of a more seamless aesthetic. For the next-generation models, Apple has apparently updated the back-glass "replacement process" to minimize the color difference between the Ceramic Shield 2 glass and the aluminum frame, resulting in a more unified appearance. Next-Level Battery Life Thicker Chassis The iPhone 18 Pro Max will feature a bigger battery for continued best-in-class battery life, claims a Chinese leaker. The Weibo user known as "Digital Chat Station" said that the ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max will have a battery capacity of 5,100 to 5,200 mAh. (The iPhone 17 Pro Max has the biggest ‌iPhone‌ battery to date at 5,088 mAh. Apple says it has a battery life of up to 39 hours.) According to another rumor, the body of the iPhone 18 Pro Max will be slightly thicker than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, raising the device's weight to around 243 grams. That would make the iPhone 18 Pro Max approximately 3 grams more than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is currently the heaviest model Apple has produced. A larger battery is the most likely cause. Smaller Dynamic Island Under-Screen Face ID? Rumors continue to circulate about whether the iPhone 18 Pro models will introduce under-display Face ID, but reports remain divided on when the technology will actually arrive. The feature would move the TrueDepth camera system beneath the display, eliminating the need for the current Dynamic Island cutout. Wayne Ma of The Information, Apple is targeting a design without a Dynamic Island, replacing it with a single pinhole camera in the upper-left corner of the screen. However, other sources dispute that claim. Display analyst Ross Young believes under-display Face ID is possible for the iPhone 18 Pro, but says a smaller Dynamic Island will still be present. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has echoed this view, reporting that the new models will feature a slimmed-down Dynamic Island rather than removing it entirely. Apple is also said to be testing new camera miniaturization technology to reduce the size of the front-facing camera currently located within the Dynamic Island. claimed the Dynamic Island cutout on the iPhone 18 Pro models will be approximately 35% narrower than it is on the iPhone 17 Pro models. Specifically, they said it will have a width of around 13.5mm, down from around 20.7mm Instant Digital has offered yet another version of events, saying the Dynamic Island will shrink in size, but that under-display Face ID and camera technology won't debut this year. Overall, the consensus suggests Apple may be refining the Dynamic Island before fully transitioning to an all-screen design in future generations. A20 Pro Chip 2nm Process The iPhone 18 Pro models will use Apple's A20 chip, based on TSMC's 2nm process for power and efficiency improvements. A move to 2nm fabrication increases transistor density, which will enable higher performance. The A20 series is expected to deliver roughly a 15 percent speed gain and about 30 percent better efficiency compared with the A19 series used in Apple's iPhone 17 models. Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) technology, suggesting at least some A20 chips will have RAM integrated directly onto the same wafer as the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, rather than sitting adjacent to the chip and connected via a silicon interposer. This could contribute to faster performance for both overall tasks and Apple Intelligence, and longer battery life from improved power efficiency. C2 Modem Replacing Qualcomm Apple plans to include its next-generation C2 modem in the iPhone 18 Pro models, according to supply chain analyst Jeff Pu. The chip will succeed the C1 modem, which debuted in the lower-cost iPhone 16e as Apple's first in-house cellular modem, and the C1X modem chip in the iPhone Air, which Apple says is up to 2× faster than the C1. The C2 is expected to bring faster speeds, improved power efficiency, and support for mmWave 5G in the United States – a feature missing from the C1 and C1X. Apple's modem roadmap is part of a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on Qualcomm, which currently supplies 5G modems for the rest of the iPhone lineup. The company has been working on developing its own cellular chips for years, aiming for deeper integration and greater control over power management and performance. New Camera Sensor Samsung-Made Samsung is working on a new three-layer stacked image sensor, reportedly intended for the iPhone 18. The sensor, referred to as PD-TR-Logic, integrates three layers of circuitry, which would improve camera responsiveness, reduce noise, and increase dynamic range. The leak comes from a source known as "Jukanlosreve," who claims the sensor is being developed specifically for Apple's 2026 iPhone lineup. Sony has long been Apple's sole image sensor supplier, so Samsung's entry would be a big shift in the iPhone's camera supply chain. Variable Aperture DSLR-Style Apple intends to equip this year's iPhone 18 Pro models with a variable aperture lens, according to reports. Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station claims the main rear camera – what Apple calls the 48-megapixel Fusion camera – on both iPhone 18 Pro models will offer variable aperture, which would be a first for the iPhone. A variable-aperture system physically adjusts the lens opening, letting more light in for low-light shots or narrowing the opening for brighter scenes and deeper depth of field. November 2024 that Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models will get the feature. 5G Satellite Internet Non-Terrestrial Data According to a report by The Information, Apple plans to add support for 5G networks that operate via satellites rather than Earth-based towers as early as next year. This advancement would allow future iPhones to gain full internet connectivity through satellite, not just limited emergency features. If Apple meets the 2026 target, the first devices to feature 5G satellite internet would likely be the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and the long-rumored foldable iPhone. Apple partners with Globalstar for its iPhone satellite features, but there is currently no service that delivers full 5G satellite internet directly to a smartphone, and the report did not specify who would supply it. Simplified Camera Control New Design Apple is reportedly working to simplify the Camera Control button's design on iPhone 18 models in order to reduce costs. The current Camera Control button on iPhone 17 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the force sensor recognizes different pressure levels for taps, presses, and swipes. remove the capacitive sensing layer and retain only pressure sensing recognition in the second iteration to achieve all Camera Control functions on the iPhone 18. The simplified version is not about reducing functionality in the button, but about saving money. The current solution is said to be very expensive for Apple and is generating costly after-sales repairs. New Colors Three in Testing Apple is rumored to be testing three new color options for the iPhone 18 Pro models: burgundy, brown, and purple. A burgundy finish would mark the first time the Pro and Pro Max models have been offered in any shade of red, apart from the lighter (PRODUCT)RED used on earlier devices. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were previously available in Deep Purple, and Apple has never released an iPhone in a genuinely brown color.

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Code references in the latest version of iOS point to what might sound like a surprising new feature in CarPlay: the ability to play movies and TV shows in your car.
iOS 26.4, which has just launched in beta form, contains two giveaway strings, both of which mention an important safety measure. “When you’re not driving,” reads the first, “open Apple TV on iPhone and review the privacy information.” While the second reads: “When you’re not driving, sign in to Apple TV on iPhone.”
These code strings were spotted by the MacRumors analyst Aaron Perris, who posted his discovery to Twitter/X. The Apple news site 9to5Mac further spotted five references that contain the words “CarPlayVideoPlayback,” juxtaposed with terms such as “ClimateControls” and “Notifications.”
It’s worth noting that while these snippets point to the feature approaching launch, the concept is not a total surprise. “Video in the car” was originally announced as part of the iOS 26 update last year, and is still mentioned in the CarPlay section of Apple’s developer site.
“AirPlay video in the car enables people to watch their favorite videos from iPhone right on their CarPlay display when they aren’t driving,” the page explains. “Integrate support for CarPlay with AirPlay video to enable this feature in your car.”
That’s the key: it was left up to automakers to authorise and integrate the feature. And up to now, no automaker has chosen to do that, or announced that it intends to do so in the future. But this latest discovery hints that progress is finally being made.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Many of us are quite used to carrying around a handy power bank to top up our iPhone batteries during a long day away from a power socket, but these pocketable battery packs are usually not powerful enough to keep an unplugged and energy-hungry MacBook going all day.
We’ve rounded up the best portable laptop power banks with battery capacities high enough to recharge a fading Apple MacBook if you won’t be able to plug it into an electrical outlet for some time.
Despite new laptops boasting improved battery life duration, it’s easy for your trusty MacBook to lose power after a day of intense meetings and PowerPoint presentations. No one wants to see the Mac’s “Your battery is running low” warning, especially when halfway through watching a downloaded Netflix series on a long-haul flight.
We looked at seven main factors for recommending laptop power banks: battery capacity, charging speed, total power output, power input, USB ports, portability and safety. For more details on each see below this list of the best MacBook power banks.
Power vs portability
As a rule, the higher the battery capacity, the larger and heavier the power bank. We have included size and weight so you can determine if each power bank suits your traveling needs. Some laptop power banks are built to last in the great outdoors so will feature more rugged IP-rated shells; read on for our reviews below.
There are much smaller, lighter and more portable power banks for phones—check out our recommendations of the best power banks for iPhone. You could use some of these to recharge a laptop but we recommend the power banks tested and reviewed here for the best results when powering up a laptop.
There are some giant power banks, usually called portable power stations, that can keep a family going all weekend, but they are way too large to carry with you on your travels. We have tested the most MacBook-friendly models in our roundup of the best portable power stations.
Macworld Test Score
We test each power bank’s real-world charging prowess by recharging a spent 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro from 0% to 100% (or as far as it gets) and then repeat, adding the two percentages together to create a comparable Test Score.
Which power bank is best for your MacBook in 2026?
We have indicated which models of MacBook we think each power bank is best suited to, but that doesn’t mean you can’t pair any with different MacBooks. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W so owners of that model should look for a PD 3.1 power bank. But even a 13-inch MacBook Air will work well with the higher-capacity power banks. They might not charge any faster, but they will be recharged more times if you pick a high-capacity battery pack. Pros

The Anker Prime 26K Power Bank (300W) is one of the most powerful laptop power banks that you can match with your MacBook. It is a great fit with the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has a battery rated at around the same watt hours (99.6WH) as this power bank (99.75Wh).
There are three USB ports. Each of the two USB-C ports can be used to power at 140W. Attach Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable or the included 240W USB-C cable to the power back and you can utilize one of the 140W PD 3.1 ports to fast-charge the 16-inch Pro. Indeed, with its 300W total output at your disposal you could fast-charge two of the top-end MacBooks at the same time and still have enough juice to fast-charge your iPhone!
Anker claims that you can fast-charge that top-end MacBook Pro up to 50% in 27 minutes. In our tests, we charged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to full power with enough left over to power it back to 25% on the second recharge.
You can recharge the power bank itself to 50% in under 150 minutes using the two USB-C ports at the same time at an impressive 250W.
This is a sophisticated power bank with some tricks of its own. It can be controlled by an app, which gives real-time charging stats (Remaining Charging Time and Input and Output power indicators) and can be optimized to help extend the battery life of the devices being charged as well as its own. You can even use the app’s Find Device feature to activate a sound alert from the power bank when you need to locate it.
Anker also sells a 27K Prime Power Bank, available in either black or gold colors. We prefer the 26K model as it’s a little smaller, performed better in our tests, and out guns the 27K model in total output (300W vs 250W) and input (250W vs 170W).
Who should buy the Anker Prime 26K 300W Power Bank?
Powerful enough to charge two 16-inch MacBooks at the same time, this power bank is a great travelling companion for any of Apple’s laptops. Both its 300W total output and 250W input are top-end for a truly portable power bank.

Although a little larger and heavier than the Anker Prime 26K 300W Power Bank, reviewed above, the EcoFlow RAPID Pro 27K Power Bank (300W) has a hidden weapon in its battle for the best MacBook power bank: a built-in retractable USB-C cable tucked away in its base—saving you from carrying a spare cable around with you and keeping your travel bag neat and tidy.
Like the Anker Prime 26K, this power bank can fast-charge two 16-inch MacBook Pros at full pelt. It boasts the same 200W total output, and has two more USB-C ports—both at a potential 65W—but no legacy USB-A port. If you need a USB-A port, look to the Anker Prime instead. USB-A aside, it can recharge up to four devices at the same time, although. With three devices it can output at 140W, 95W and 65W—enough for three MacBooks at the same time. And using all four charging points, still allows for two MacBooks at 140W. with the remaining two USB-C ports sharing 20W.
In our tests it scored 120%—a little lower than the Anker Prime’s 125% but nothing substantial in comparison. It can be recharged itself at 280W, which is a little faster than its Anker rival.
Who should buy the EcoFlow RAPID Pro 27K 300W Power Bank?
As powerful as the Anker Prime 26K Power Bank and boasting a built-in USB-C cable plus an extra port, the EcoFlow RAPID Pro is a real rival for the crown. If you can take the (minimal) extra weight and don’t need a USB-A port, it is highly if only for the retractable cable.

The Ugreen 48000mAh 300W Portable Power Bank is the missing link between a laptop power bank and a full-blown power station. It has a huge battery capacity but is still portable, although you wouldn’t want to carry it around in your backpack all day, and it’s too powerful to take on a commercial flight.
It has a handle so is carriable, but the bulk and weight mean it is one to move around inside or carry in a car. It would be the perfect power companion on a camping trip. It’s not super-heavy, but it is noticeably larger than the other laptop power banks tested here.
Keep it powered up in case of power outages and it should keep your laptop and phone going for days. In our tests we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro 1.8 times, so you can expect to get maybe as many as two charges for a MacBook Air. The Pro charged from 5% to 90% in an hour, which impressed us.
There are five ports (three USB-C and two USB-A) with a maximum simultaneous power output of 300W. As it has a 140W PD 3.1 USB-C port, it can be used to fast charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro. At the same time, you could charge another top-end MacBook Pro at 100W, and use one of the USB-A ports at 22.5W.
The smart display shows the remaining battery, total input and output power.
Who should buy the Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank (300W)?
Portable but certainly not pocketable, this is the border between power banks and power stations and would be a great travel gadget if you have a vehicle to carry it in. It is also a mini-prepper’s safeguard against power outages at home.

Retractable cables are very in right now—although nicely tucked away when not in use—for power banks and chargers. This 20K Ugreen Nexode Power Bank has one 2.1-foot retractable 100W USB-C cable nestled and ready for action right next to another 100W USB-C port and a 33W USB-A port.
At under 19oz it’s a little lighter than the cable-friendly Anker 25K 165W power bank, reviewed below, and is half an inch shorter, too. Although it matches the Anker on 165W maximum power output and 100W ports it does have a smaller battery capacity—although is therefore $20 cheaper. In our tests the 25K Anker recharged a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 92% while this 20K Ugreen power bank reached a respectable 78%.
In the battle for power and cable convenience, these two power banks must be chosen on capacity, portability and price.
Who should buy the Ugreen Nexode 20K 165W Power Bank?
This mid-range laptop power bank is compact and lightweight with a handy retractable cable, and will get your MacBook back up to about three-quarters power on a single recharge. Ugreen Ugreen sells another 20K model with a built-in USB-C charging cable. The $79 Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh 130W (above) is shorter at 5.1 x 2.1 x 1.9 inches (12.9 x 5.3 x 4.8cm) and $20 cheaper with the same 20K capacity but a lower max power output of 130W vs 165W. It weighs fractionally less than the 165W Nexode. Buy the 130W model if all you need is to charge a MacBook at 100W and an iPhone at 30W—this stubbier cousin may be all you need. It’s integrated 5.4-inch USB-C cable—useful for MacBooks and later iPhones—is nowhere near as long as the 165W model’s 2.1ft retractable cable but it can double up as a carry handle. Buy the 165W model if you regularly charge two laptops at the same time: one at 100W and the other at 65W. On both 20K models, the USB-A output can be handy for legacy devices.

The performance is impressive—we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to a respectable 92%, not far off the 100% from its slightly higher-capacity sibling Anker 27650mAh power bank—but what we love about this laptop battery pack is its handy 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable USB-C cable that means you don’t have to carry one with you when you take the power bank walkies. There’s even a second built-in USB-C cable that doubles up as a carrying loop.
Each USB-C port can output and provide input at 100W.
The cable wraps neatly into a groove at the top of the power bank. There’s spare USB-C and USB-A ports on one side, so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Note that if you want to charge more than one device, they must share the maximum output of 165W between them. However, 165W can only be supplied by two devices; with three and four devices, the maximum output is limited to 133W, although that is likely enough for most needs.
It’s available in either Space Black or Silver.
With its integrated cables this is one of the the most travel friendly laptop power bank we’ve tested.
A cheaper alternative is the 65W Baseus Free2Pull Power Bank that features one retractable USB-C cable, which is available in the U.S. at Amazon or in the U.K. via AliExpress.
Who should buy the Anker Power Bank (25K, 165W) with Cables?
If you frequently recharge multiple devices at the same time, maybe one integrated USB-C cable won’t be enough for you. This power bank boasts two cables, and performed well in our tests.

The INIU P62-E1 20000mAh (65W) Power Bank may have a dull name but it stands out a mile with its colorful looks—it’s available in six bold colors—and dare-to-be-different compact shape.
Not just fun to look at and easy to hold, it performed excellently in our tests, recharging a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 87% from a flat start, outperforming our 20K power bank, the Ugreen Nexode 20000mAh Power Bank, reviewed higher up, by nearly 10%. That Ugreen power bank features an integrated retractable USB-C cable and is more powerful with 100W outputs and a maximum 165W power—beating the 65W INIU.
The INIU P62-E1 might not have a retractable cable but it does boast a removable USB-C cable that creates a handy carrying loop.
While 65W is a little lacking—but not unusable—for the Pro MacBooks it’s ample for the MacBook Air. Who should buy the INIU Cougar 20K (65W) Power Bank?
Stand out from the crowd with this cute and compact laptop power bank that offers impressive performance for MacBooks that don’t require top-end power output to fast charge. That said, even MacBook Pro owners may desire something as lovely as the Cougar.

The Anker Prime 20K Power Bank is a laptop power bank that is lighter and smaller than the top-end Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank, but boasts the same number of USB ports.
Anker has a couple of 20K laptop power banks that are worth considering. The latest model is the 3-port Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (220W), which boasts two 140W PD 3.1 fast-charging USB-C ports and a 22.5W USB-A. When charging with all three ports at the same time, it offers two 100W outputs and a 20W. With two it can output two USB-C at 110W or one at 140W and the USB-A at 22.5W.
The older but slightly cheaper Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (200W) doesn’t feature the 140W PD 3.1 USB-C ports, instead packing two 100W USB-C ports and a generous 65W USB-A port. That doesn’t rule it out as a battery pack for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it can’t fast-charge Apple’s largest laptop. Its maximum output of 200W is a little below the 220W model.
Both feature a clear display but only the 220W model works with the Anker app. While the 27650mAh Anker Prime can be charged itself at 200W, the two Anker 20K Power Banks can be charged at a lower, but still reasonable, 100W using just one of its USB-C ports.
The 200W model is noticeably shorter than the 220W, measuring 4.9 x 2.1 x 2 inches (12.7 x 5.5 x 5cm) compared to the 220W’s 5.8 x 2 x 1.7 inches (4.4 x 5.0 x 14.7cm), although the 220W is a little lighter at 1.1lbs (510g) compared to the 200W’s 1.17lbs (529g).
The 200W model is cheaper at $139 compared to the 220W model’s $179 price tag, but both appear quite expensive when compared to some rival 20K power banks; see the Ugreen 20K Power Bank reviewed below. The 200W model fared impressively in our recharge test.
Who should buy the Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (220W or 200W)?
Although priced at a premium, these are great options for the smaller MacBooks unless you need as much power in the bank as you can carry. If you don’t need the 140W outputs, the 200W model will save you some cash, or consider the lower-output Ugreen Nexode 20K Power Bank below..
Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Thomas Bergbold Ugreen’s equivalent to the Anker Prime 20K Power Banks is the much cheaper $89 Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh, pictured above. The battery capacities of both are identical, but the Ugreen is noticeably lighter (1lb or 480g) even though its dimensions are closely aligned: 5.1 x 2.1 x 2.0 inches (13.1 x 5.4 x 5.1cm). Each has a smart display that tells you more than enough about what’s going on between the power bank and the devices being charged.
The Ugreen Nexode is a more portable solution, but we still prefer the Anker Prime model for both its impressive USB ports. The Anker has two 100W USB-C ports, while the Ugreen’s USB-C ports are rated at 100W and 30W. As the Ugreen power bank has a maximum power output of 130W, this doesn’t matter, but the Anker can pump out up to 220W simultaneously, making its powerful ports more useful. Power input is also better on the Anker (100W) vs the Ugreen (65W).
However, we’ve seen the Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh priced a lot more competitively than the Anker Prime 20K, and that weight difference may be important to you. Also, for the lone traveller one port for the MacBook and another for fast-charging an iPhone or iPad might be all that’s required. Read our full Ugreen Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh 130W review.

The Cuktech 15 Air laptop power bank we tested might not perform to the same degree as more expensive rivals but offers great value for money, and is hand-grip portable. Its color smart display has all the charging info you should require: battery level, input and output power, and estimated recharge time.
Its 15K (15000mAh) battery managed to charge our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to 54% power. That’s not as impressive as the 20K power banks reviewed here but it’s one of the cheapest MacBook battery packs that we trust.
You can use it as a multiple-charge iPhone power bank, too: it should charge an iPhone 17 Pro Max around 1.6 times. With the three USB ports all in action, you can charge the MacBook at 65W and share the remaining 33W between the other USB-C and USB-A ports.

The Cuktech 15 laptop power bank we tested might not perform to the same degree as more expensive rivals but offers great value for money.

A little cheaper than the higher-capacity Cuktech 20, reviewed below, this slim laptop power bank can also fast-charge even the 16-inch MacBook Pro with its 140W output. The 20 looks the better buy in terms of capacity and at a similar price, but the 15 Ultra has a special feature known as Beast Mode.
While the 25000mAh battery of the Cuktech 20 is certainly worth the small extra investment on this 15 Ultra in terms of capacity, this 20000mAh power bank impresses with its super-speedy 165W input, which means you can recharge itself faster than most using Beast Mode where you use both the USB-C ports to recharge the power bank up to 70% in around 20 minutes.
The smart display shows you what each of the ports is doing, battery status, connected devices, and when the unit is powering up in Beast Mode.

Outdoor adventurers and in-the-field professionals need devices that are stronger than softy office desk jockeys and occasional airport travelers, and the Sandberg Survivor boasts a tough !P66 shell that is impervious to water and dust. As such it is bigger than most power banks but it would survive outdoors much longer and has a big enough battery to keep a bunch of devices charged up before being introduced to a wall charger again.
Behind a protective rubber flap there are three USB ports: two old-school USB-A and one USB-C. We would have preferred more USB-C, which is used on most modern devices, and that singular USB-C port is also where you will charge the power bank itself. The USB-C port outputs at up to 65W and receives power at 60W. Each of the USB-A ports can output at 18W. Total simultaneous power output is 65W. Uniquely, there is also a 24W DC 5525 port if your devices can be powered using this connection.
As it charges at a maximum 65W, it’s better suited to the lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro and 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air, rather than the more powerful versions of the 14- and 16-inch Pro MacBooks that prefer a 100W or higher charger. That said, if your 16-inch Pro is on an outdoors adventure, the Survivor will still charge it, just a little slower than a 100W or 140W power bank.
Who should buy the Sandberg Survivor Powerbank?
If the other laptop power banks reviewed here look too fragile for your next trip to the mountains or jungle, the Survivor is built to take some punishment—just look out for your MacBook! Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air or any adventurer’s laptop Pros

Built for travel, this combo 4-in-1 wall charger and 10K battery pack can charge a laptop at 45W as a power bank and at 65W when plugged directly into a wall power socket. It comes with international plug adapters for U.K., E.U. and AU/NZ that slip onto the built-in U.S. foldable prongs—great for travel or just use in your own region. It even has a fold-out rubber handle that you can use to attach it to your backpack while hiking.
Its 10000mAh battery capacity is certainly not the highest of the laptop power banks we have reviewed here, but it did recharge a completely faded 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro back up to 45%, which should get you an extra few hours charge when on the move, depending on your laptop’s battery health.
Its two USB-C and one USB-A ports make it a capable AC wall charger, and a magnetic side pad works as a 15W Qi2 wireless charger for the MagSafe-ready iPhone 12 to 16 families. If charging by wall, the USB-C port output is 65W. When operating as a power bank, the USB-C port outputs 45W, unless also wireless charging when the maximum out put is 30W (15W wireless plus 15W USB-C).
A smart displays shows the power bank’s remaining battery charge, remaining time to full charge, real time output/input, and temperature.

Both a 20K power bank and mini desktop charger (when connected to a USB-C wall charger). this stubbily compact battery pack features a 100W USB-C port at its rear and a 45W USB-C and 22.5W USB-A port at the front underneath a large color smart display. While certainly portable it isn’t one to slip in your pocket or clamp to your phone on the move—the Nexode Qi2 is aimed at the iPhone using laptop owner. It’s a handy travel companion that should handle most of your power bank needs while out and about, and then sit on a desk as a smart-looking and informative charger that can charge four devices simultaneously.

The Cuktech 20 Power Bank 25000mAh 140W PD 3.1 power bank looks a lot like the Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, in a tall format with an informative smart display.
As with the Anker, there are three USB ports, with one at the required 140W for fast-charging a 16-inch MacBook Pro. The other two ports aren’t as powerful as the Anker’s though: 45W vs 140W, and 30W vs 65W.
An M2 MacBook Air should be fully charged with a little power left over for your iPhone, AirPods or Apple Watch.
Power input is also not as great, but at 110W it’s impressive enough compared to most. Maximum simultaneous power output is 210W—again not as high as the Anker but still respectable. The Cuktech’s display gives more data than the Anker, which is informative for wattage junkies but probably overkill for most of us, who just need to know how much battery life remains in the power bank. Anker’s dedicated app is perhaps more useful. Again, this is a nice to have and the Cuktech power bank does the important stuff of recharging the laptop at a price point that is noticeably lower than Anker’s.
Who should buy the Cuktech 20 Power Bank?
This is an affordable 140W-capable power bank that lacks some of its rivals’ top-end specs but might be all you require at that price. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro. Pros

The Cuktech CP253L is a budget rival to the Anker 165W Power Bank and Baseus Free2Pull Power Bank, and indeed any of the 20K laptop power banks reviewed here. It wins points for its built-in USB-C cable, although at 6 inches (15cm) the cable not as long or handy as the 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable cable on the Baseus.
It is also a less powerful: 45W vs 60W via USB-C, and charges itself slower, too. It recharged our test MacBook Pro to 75%, again a little off the Baseus performance but probably enough for most users in need of a power boost. At 45W it’s fine for the MacBook Air but a little underpowered for the Pro MacBooks, which will charge a little slower.
(We’re only interested in Apple’s MacBook here but if you also own a Xiaomi laptop, its USB-C connectors can charge at 55W and the USB-A supports 33W UFCS charging for some Chinese phones.)
Who should buy the Cuktech CP253L 20K Power Bank?
The lower power input and output plus shorter cable, along with a slightly heavier weight, are compromises you may well overlook when you see the price. This is a great-looking—in either black or a cool white—and solidly performing portable battery pack for your laptop. It’s also available in the U.K. unlike the Baseus.

This is another column-shaped laptop power bank with a high-capacity. The three top-mounted USB ports support PD 3.1 so it is particularly useful for owners of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which can be fast-charged using one of this power bank’s 140W ports. As total power output is also 140W, you can’t charge another device at the same time as fast-charging that top-end MacBook. If you want to simultaneously charge more devices, look for a power bank with a higher maximum power output. The similarly designed Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, can use all three of its ports up to 250W. The Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank, also reviewed previously, is a larger unit but can reach 300W total power output.
The Alogic Ark has a smart display screen that shows you how fast devices are charging, remaining battery capacity, and how long it will keep charging at the current speed.

      <title><![CDATA[Rumor: Apple to Announce Multiple New Products in First Week of March]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-announcements-first-week-of-march/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple on Monday invited selected journalists and content creators to a "special Apple Experience" on Wednesday, March 4 in New York, London, and Shanghai. And now, rumors are surfacing about Apple's broader plans for that week. Daring Fireball's John Gruber today guessed that Apple will announce new products on a day-by-day basis from Monday, March 2 through Wednesday, March 4:
What strikes me is that March 4 — the "experience" day — is a Wednesday. So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the "experience" will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos.
In response to Gruber's post, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said product announcements on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of that week is indeed "exactly" what he is expecting, based on what he has heard from his sources. Gurman does not expect a typical Apple Event live stream for the new products, with the announcements likely to occur in the form of press releases on the Apple Newsroom website instead. However, there could still be a short video prepared for each new product, and the media would get hands-on time with the new products. Apple has announced new products on a Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday basis multiple times in the past, including in March 2019 (new iPad mini and iPad Air, iMac, and AirPods models) and in October 2024 (new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models). Lower-Cost MacBook: A18 Pro chip, 12.9-inch display, and fun color options. iPhone 17e: A spec-bumped successor to the iPhone 16e, with rumored upgrades including an A19 chip, MagSafe, and Apple's C1X and N1 wireless chips. The device will apparently have a notch despite earlier rumors mentioning a Dynamic Island, and pricing will continue to start at $599 in the United States. iPad Air: M3 chip → M4 chip. iPad: A16 chip → A18 chip or A19 chip. MacBook Air: M4 chip → M5 chip. MacBook Pro: M4 Pro and M4 Max chips → M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, and PCIe 5.0 support for faster SSD speeds. Mac Studio: M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips → M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips. Studio Display: 27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting, up to 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and either an A19 chip or A19 Pro chip. Home Hub: An all-new smart home hub featuring the more personalized version of Siri, a 6-inch to 7-inch square display, an A18 chip for Apple Intelligence, FaceTime, and more. Place it on a table or mount it on a wall. Security Camera: Apple-designed, HomeKit-enabled security camera accessory to be sold alongside the new smart home hub.
In addition, rumors about new Apple TV and HomePod mini models have been circulating for more than a year, but there is still no sign of them. In the end, we might only get three of these new products in the first week of March, with the most likely possibilities being the lower-cost MacBook with an iPhone chip, the iPhone 17e, and perhaps either an updated iPad Air or entry-level iPad. tested those three colors plus pink for the MacBook with an iPhone chip. MacRumors will be attending the "Apple Experience," so stay tuned for our coverage.

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's camera and microphone indicators are supposed to tell iPhone users when the microphone or camera are on, but after a device is fully compromised with kernel-level access by another hack, Predator spyware can prevent those from appearing. Malware can defeat iOS privacy indicators for recording
Camera and microphone indicators, which first appeared in iOS 14, are a big part of Apple's privacy message. Users depend on them to know when recording is going on.
Security researchers at Jamf found that Predator spyware can prevent those iOS recording indicators from appearing. It's not a standalone attack though — the technique is post-compromise behavior, and the analysis doesn't describe a new iOS vulnerability or a flaw that needs patching.

March 4 marks Apple's next big announcement day, which it plans to celebrate with three invite-only "experiences" in London, Shanghai, and New York City. If you follow the rumors and speculation, you'll know that Apple's allegedly getting ready to add a new, lower-priced MacBook back into its lineup.

In a new video, YouTuber Linzin took viewers on a 22-minute journey through Huaqiangbei, China's famous electronics market. There, technicians worked their magic by laser-stripping the rear glass of an iPhone Air for a see-through effect.
They didn't stop there and milled space for a SIM slot directly into the frame. They also handled delicate board-level microsoldering to make the eSIM-only iPhone Air work with a physical SIM card.
The modified phone powered on, connected to a carrier, and worked just fine. It did run hotter under load and lost its water resistance. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/apple-west-virginia-csam-lawsuit/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[West Virginia's Attorney General JB McCuskey today announced a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of knowingly allowing iCloud to be used to distribute and store child sexual abuse material (CSAM). McCuskey says that Apple has opted to "do nothing about it" for years. "Preserving the privacy of child predators is absolutely inexcusable. And more importantly, it violates West Virginia law. Since Apple has so far refused to police themselves and do the morally right thing, I am filing this lawsuit to demand Apple follow the law, report these images, and stop re-victimizing children by allowing these images to be stored and shared," Attorney General JB McCuskey said. According to the lawsuit [PDF], Apple has described itself as the "greatest platform for distributing child porn" internally, but it submits far fewer reports about CSAM than peers like Google and Meta. new child safety features, including a system that would detect known CSAM in images stored in iCloud Photos. After backlash from customers, digital rights groups, child safety advocates, and security researchers, Apple decided to abandon its plans for CSAM detection in ‌iCloud Photos‌. "Children can be protected without companies combing through personal data, and we will continue working with governments, child advocates, and other companies to help protect young people, preserve their right to privacy, and make the internet a safer place for children and for us all," Apple said when announcing that it would not implement the feature. later explained that creating a tool for scanning private ‌iCloud‌ data would "create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit." West Virginia's Attorney General says that Apple has shirked its responsibility to protect children under the guise of user privacy, and that Apple's decision not to deploy detection technology is a choice, not passive oversight. The lawsuit suggests that since Apple has end-to-end control over hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure, it is not able to claim to be an "unknowing, passive conduit of CSAM." The lawsuit is seeking punitive damages and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection measures. Tag: Apple Lawsuits

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone satellite capabilities can grow, but physics are remorseless. There's still a limit on how much satellite internet can do and how fast it can do it — unless Apple produces a case that it has been researching that doubles as a big antenna.
When Apple first launched Emergency SOS via Satellite with the iPhone 14 back in 2022, it was remarkable idea that since then has saved many lives. Apple has improved it since, and has plans for much more in future, but there is always an issue over establishing the satellite contact.
Users have to point their iPhone in the direction of a satellite orbiting the Earth, and then keep pointing at it as the satellite moves relative to the sender. One single low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite will cross from horizon to horizon in seven minutes, but line-of-site connection time is less than that in real life, and depends on buildings, trees, and terrain.
The iPhone software helps locate and track the satellite. The iPhone antenna still has a small surface area, and isn't that high-powered. Only so much data can reliably be sent before the satellite has moved away.
Now in a newly-revealed patent application originally filed in 2024, Apple has shown how it has been researching a way around this. "Electronic Device and Case with Satellite Communication Capabilities" details ways of using a case to act as an antenna for the iPhone.

It's pretty common these days. A TikTok lie about Apple pops up, and it's passed around and cloned on the site. Millions of hits later, it reaches the ears of mainstream media, who pick it up like it's gospel, straight from Tim Cook's desk.
The latest lie is that the 2026 iPhone is getting a nearly microscopic MacBook-like Magsafe charger, and USB-C will be purged from the device. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Apple's February 9, 2026 update to the CarPlay Developer Guide introduces a new CarPlay entitlement category for voice-driven conversational apps. The move creates an official path for third-party AI assistants to operate inside CarPlay rather than relying solely on Siri.
The change arrives as generative AI becomes more embedded across Apple platforms. CarPlay is next, but Apple is setting clear boundaries. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Kill iPhone spam with these 10 tips]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3057914/10-free-iphone-features-to-block-spam-and-daily-distractions.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld The iPhone has become an all-in-one device for communication, entertainment, productivity, and more. Naturally, as we install more apps, the number of unwanted notifications keeps growing. Spam is no longer limited to occasional emails, texts, and calls; many apps now use push notifications to deliver ads, irrelevant recommendations, and other distracting alerts. Fortunately, iOS includes a comprehensive set of tools that help you reduce all sorts of spam types and focus on what actually matters.
1. Good ol’ blocking
Blocking remains one of the simplest, most straightforward ways to shut down a consistent source of noise. If the same phone number keeps texting or calling you, you can easily head to the info card in Messages or the Phone app’s call log and hit the Block button. All relevant third-party communication apps offer a blocking functionality as well.
Similarly, if an app you installed has been abusing the push notification system, you can tweak or revoke the permission. In the Notifications section of the Settings app, you can decide how an app gets to notify you, if at all. For example, you could turn off the Sounds toggle to receive silent alerts or uncheck the Lock Screen option to stop seeing banners when your iPhone is idle.
Before revoking an app’s notification permission, it’s wise to scan the settings in the app itself. Many apps let you opt out of certain notification categories. This enables you to still receive updates about the things you care about, and nothing else.
2. Limit mirroring
The Apple ecosystem lets iPhone users mirror calls to nearby iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches. That’s not to mention that, beyond calls, macOS and watchOS support third-party app notification mirroring, and AirPods can interrupt your music playback to announce incoming alerts. These integrations are welcome, but can make using our everyday devices overwhelming. Fortunately, you can choose what alerts get mirrored to other devices without completely blocking them on iOS.
In the Settings app, under Notifications, you can turn off (for individual or all apps) the Announce Notifications feature that reads out alerts when your AirPods are connected. Likewise, you can go to each app’s notification settings and disable the Show on Mac toggle to stop mirroring alerts to macOS. The Watch app offers a comparable section to manage the notifications iOS pushes to watchOS, too.
To prevent all of your devices from ringing every time someone calls you, you can head to the Phone app’s settings and turn off Calls on Other Devices.
3. AI notification handling
If you’re using a newer iPhone, the on-device AI can analyze the contents of your alerts and highlight the ones it deems important. Apple Intelligence can also summarize long or multiple texts to make grasping their content easier. To set these features up, go to the Prioritize Notifications and Summarize Notifications pages in the Settings app’s Notifications section. Foundry 4. Scheduled summaries
Scheduled Summary is yet another alert management tool that helps you avoid unnecessary distractions. When enabled in the Notifications settings page, the feature bundles unimportant alerts throughout the day and delivers them together at a time of your choosing. iOS will still notify you about time-sensitive updates, like calls and urgent notifications. Foundry 5. Focus modes
Focus is Apple’s advanced do-not-disturb system, letting you pick which apps and contacts can notify you across your devices. You can create multiple Focus modes with varying rules to match your different activities. The Focus mode dedicated to work, for example, would let alerts from your boss and collaborative apps through. You could also set in-app filters that hide content accordingly, like concealing non-work inboxes in the Mail app. To set it up, head to Focus in the Settings app. Foundry 6. Messaging controls
While blocking is effective for alerts coming from the same source, users often get spammed by random numbers. Luckily, the Messages app accommodates that, letting you silence all texts (or non-time-sensitive ones) from unknown numbers. It could also place them in a separate inbox to keep your main view clutter-free. Go to Messages settings, enable the Filter Spam and Screen Unknown Senders toggles, then customize how you want the feature to behave.
7. Call management
In Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Phone, you can enable similar filters for incoming calls. Under Screen Unknown Callers, you can choose if unsaved numbers are silenced or asked for the reason of calling automatically using on-device AI. The latter option will display a transcript in real time, so you can pick up and take over the call if it turns out to be relevant. Otherwise, enabling the Unknown Callers toggle under Call Filtering will move missed calls and voicemails from unsaved numbers to a separate list. Foundry 8. Third-party solutions
While call management tools have become reliable on iOS, you could still opt for third-party apps for added functionality. TrueCaller, for example, can warn you about known spam/scam numbers and look up the likely name of the person ringing you.
9. Mail filters
Like Messages and Phone, Apple’s Mail app offers automatic lists to help keep your inbox clean. You can enable the Categories toggle under the 3-dot menu in your inbox to reveal five main lists—Primary, Transactions, Updates, Promotions, and All Mail. The Mail app will scan every incoming email and place it in the respective list, reserving the Primary list for essential messages. Foundry 10. Calendars]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3064717/apples-march-event-might-bring-several-days-of-surprises.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld We now know the date of Apple’s next event-type thing: March 4. But as ever, we won’t know the precise details or the products the company plans to announce until it chooses to make that information public.
Unusually, however, there’s a good chance that Apple will tell us about the new products first and host the event (or, to use the company’s preferred terminology, the “experience”) after. Because one respected pundit has put forward the theory that Apple will announce new iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks via press release on Monday to Wednesday of that week, before journalists and influencers are gathered for a hands-on session with the hardware.
John Gruber, writing on his Daring Fireball blog, ponders the large number of Apple releases that are expected in the next few months. We’re waiting for the iPhone 17e, he notes, new versions of the entry-level iPad (with an A18 or A19 chip) and iPad Air (with an M4), M5 Pro and Max MacBook Pro, M5 MacBook Air, and the rumored low-cost MacBook with an A18 chip. That’s a lot to fit into a single event. Perhaps too much.
“What strikes me is that March 4—the ‘experience’ day—is a Wednesday,” Gruber writes. “So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the ‘experience’ will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos.”
Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who is generally keyed into Apple’s product launches, responded on X, saying Gruber’s guess “is exactly what I am expecting based on what I’ve heard.” Gurman has previously reported that Apple had a product launch slated for March 2.
There is a precedent for this sort of serial press release strategy. At the end of October 2024, Apple sent out announcements on consecutive days for the M4 iMac (October 28), M4 Mac mini (October 29), and M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro (October 30). The company even called this an “exciting week of announcements,” even though it only lasted for three days and wasn’t especially exciting, focusing only on the Mac section of its product portfolio. A week of announcements covering the iPhone, iPad, and Mac might do a better job of qualifying for that adjective.]]></description>

Apple withdrew its claims back in 2024, but an independent class-action lawsuit was still being pursued on behalf of iPhone owners. This lawsuit has now been abandoned …

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3063779/move-over-meta-apple-smart-glasses-are-coming.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld In a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple has three wearable devices in the works that could establish Apple as a leader in AI hardware. Apple is “ramping up work” on smart glasses, a pendant, and AirPods with IR cameras. The three devices will not be stand-alone products and will require an iPhone connection. Apple smart glasses
Smart glasses appear to be the priority for Apple—don’t expect Apple glasses to be an augmented reality version of its Vision Pro headset. These glasses will be more like the Meta AI glasses, with a high-resolution camera capturing photos and video. The UI will depend on speakers, microphones, and a separate camera dedicated to “give the device environmental context.” Users will be able to make phone calls, use Siri, play music, and shoot photos. Also, the user will be able to “take actions based on surroundings.”
Gurman reports that Apple hopes its camera technology will separate it from Meta’s glasses. Apple is working on advanced features, such as the ability for the glasses to recognize text and convert it digitally, and the ability to create context-aware reminders, such as a prompt to tell you to pick up an item you are looking at that’s on your shopping list while in a grocery store. For navigational directions, Siri could provide landmarks instead of generic instructions. Apple also thinks it can offer superior build quality that differentiates it from Meta. The glasses will use “high-end materials, including acrylic elements intended to give the glasses a premium feel.” Different styles could be offered as the product matures over time. Apple had looked into partnering with a glasses maker, but decided against it.
Gurman stated that Apple made “significant progress” in the development of the glasses, and it could be ready for production by the end of the year, with a public release in early 2027. Apple AI pendant]]></description>

Wedbush took its Apple target price up to $350 in December 2025, based on high expectations for Apple Intelligence. Keeping that figure, it then repeated this expectation in January 2026 — and is now back to do so again, specifically because of recent rumors.
Those rumors claimed that testing of the new Siri is going poorly, and its improved features will be delayed, perhaps until iOS 27 in September. Consequently, investors have been selling off their Apple shares, but Wedbush says this is unwarranted. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

With the debut of the iPhone 15 range, Apple introduced an opt-in setting that limited battery charging to just 80%. The goal of the feature was to help preserve battery lifespan over time. iOS 18 gave iPhone users an additional option to limit battery charging anywhere from 80% to 100%.
Now, macOS has gained the same battery-preserving capability, thanks to the first macOS 26.4 developer beta, released on Monday. The macOS Tahoe version of the feature works the same way it does on iOS, featuring a slider that lets users select a specific battery charging limit.

      <description><![CDATA[Three years after the feature rolled out, Apple is automatically enabling Stolen Device Protection in iOS 26.4, expanding safeguards against an ever-expanding epidemic of iPhone theft. How to use Stolen Device Protection
In 2023, Apple rolled out a new feature called Stolen Device Protection. The feature is designed to prevent iPhones from being accessed if a thief manages to both learn a user's passcode and steal their iPhone.
This was a crucial change, as more and more reports rolled in, showing that this type of theft was on the rise. An experienced thief could easily access a user's list of passwords, access bank accounts, and disable safety features such as Find My and Trusted Devices.

      <description><![CDATA[Apple has taken a small step toward securing cross-platform messaging, with early RCS encryption support now appearing in the iOS 26.4 beta. Just don't expect to get that much testing done right now. RCS support will be extended to include end-to-end encryption
Way back in March 2025, Apple announced that it would add support for end-to-end encryption to RCS messaging on iPhone. At the time, there were very few details about when the feature would be implemented.
We got our first hint that the feature was, at the very least, being worked on in January. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Last March, Apple announced its plans to add support for end-to-end encryption for RCS messages.
Now, iOS 26.4 beta 1, which is rolling out today, adds an early way to test end-to-end encrypted RCS messaging on iPhone.

      <description><![CDATA[A new rumor claims Apple has no major redesign imminent for the iPad Pro, potentially leaving the flagship tablet in an extended cycle of incremental updates. iPad Pro might not see updates for a while
On February 16, Instant Digital posted that Apple won't be redesigning the iPad Pro significantly for a while. The report indicates that Apple will stick to routine chip updates without making major changes to the device's design.
The post states that the iPad Pro won't receive a major upgrade for years. The leaker attributes the pause to the high cost of OLED panels and limited sales growth following the last redesign.
Instant Digital has had a mixed track record with Apple leaks on Weibo. Sometimes they share accurate details like the iPhone 16 camera control button, but other times they promote claims that aren't supported by the facts or what actually happens.

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple has a new AirTag for sale, but you’re probably not rushing out to buy one since you can still get the old ones for cheaper. But this deal may change your mind: Costco is throwing in a free AirTag when you buy a 4-pack for $100, essentially giving you five new AirTags for the price of 4, a savings of $45 on the price of buying five AirTags individually. (Note: You don’t need to be a member to take advantage of this deal.)
Apple’s 2nd-gen of AirTags have the same size as the previous model, and they look virtually the same. However, they have a louder speaker, which will make them easier to find even if your keys somehow ended up between couch cushions. Apple also upgraded the Bluetooth chip inside the tracker, expanding the range at which items can be located.
Also new is the U2 Ultra Wideband chip, which will make it possible to more precisely locate lost items, something that will definitely be handy. We’ve already tested the new AirTag 2 and gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, finding it to be a simple and efficient Bluetooth tracker that’s also super easy to set up and fairly inexpensive.]]></description>

The six-episode French-language drama was scheduled to launch on December 3, 2025. In late November, it disappeared from Apple's platform after reports surfaced that it may have been mislabeled as an original work.
Apple removed The Hunt from listings and promotional placements days before its premiere without public explanation. Subsequent reporting indicated the series bore significant similarities to Douglas Fairbairn's 1973 novel Shoot and the 1976 U.S.-Canadian film adaptation of the same name.]]></description>

Ring, a home security company known for its widely adopted video doorbells, bought a Super Bowl ad space. And, within 30 seconds, the company managed to kill off any remaining goodwill it had with the general public, forcing it to back off from a proposed partnership with Flock Safety.
The idea was pitched as harmless. You mark your dog missing, the other cameras in your neighborhood keep an eye out for your dog, and if found, you get an alert. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Nothing came of it back then, but maybe not for technological reasons. It was also in 2021 that the Facebook company was renamed Meta in a feeble attempt to distance itself from its own appalling record on privacy abuses. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The rumor mill is in overdrive. These are the best candidates — and the also-rans — for what Apple will launch and then have an "experience" to demo on March 4. The more likely Apple launches for early March
It seems the March 4 Apple Experience won't be an actual launch of new products in Apple's catalog, but instead capping off multiple announcements during the week. That gives Apple a lot of opportunity to promote multiple items.
With the breadth of rumored devices on the docket, including many anticipated for launch in early 2026. it certainly needs that opportunity. But, as ever, some have more chance of making an appearance than others. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In a court case concerning the mental health effects of social media, Mark Zuckerberg's defense includes that he tried to discuss the issue with Tim Cook, who, obviously, doesn't run a social media platform. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg
The trial concerns in part the issue of age verification, which Meta has previously tried to dodge by saying Apple and Google should deal with it rather than any application. The case is a specific one brought to a Los Angeles court by a 19-year-old who claims social media led her to self-harm and suicidal thoughts.
It's being seen, though, as a test case with much wider implications. The unnamed teenager and her mother originally sued Meta, YouTube, Snap and TikTok, although the latter two have settled out of court. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple stake by 4% in the fourth quarter of 2025, but Apple remains the conglomerate's largest equity holding by a wide margin. Berkshire Hathaway trims its Apple investment
A February 17 regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows Berkshire trimmed its Apple position during the quarter ended December 31, 2025. Apple was still valued at roughly $62 billion within Berkshire's portfolio at year's end.
The filing also shows Berkshire sold 77% of its Amazon stake in the same quarter, a far more substantial reduction than the modest adjustment to Apple. The latest stock cut by Berkshire isn't a harbinger of doom but rather a routine portfolio adjustment. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple may return to its marketing playbook, delivering multiple press releases of big products in just a few days, then highlight them all at the international March 4 "experiences." Apple's experience logo has many layers. The announcement of a special event on March 4 has led to wild speculation of what Apple could introduce at the time. However, with so many oddities surrounding it all, it may not be as straightforward as people think.
On Tuesday, Daring Fireball's John Gruber proposed that Apple's reference of it as an "experience" day is unusual. The choice of holding the event on a Wednesday is also unexpected, especially when you factor in Apple's preference for Tuesday product announcements.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3063982/apple-ends-rosetta-support-macos-28.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple has made a major announcement this week that could affect the software you use, especially if it’s an older app, and you are using an M-series Mac. In a support document, Apple wrote that it will start to phase out Rosetta functionality with macOS 28. That means in two years, apps that were written for Intel-based Macs will no longer run on M-series Macs, except for “certain older, unmaintained games.”
When Apple began its switch from Intel chips to its own M-series chips in 2020, it changed the architecture of the underlying workings of the Mac. To help navigate the transition, Apple created Rosetta, which acts as a translator of Intel-based apps so they can run on M-series Macs. Rosetta will be included in macOS 27, which is expected to be released this fall. After that, Apple will limit the Rosetta implementation in macOS 28.
It’s been over five years since the first M1 Macs debuted. By the time macOS 28 is released in the fall of 2027, it’ll be seven years–Apple has a history of deprecating products after such time.
Developers have had plenty of time to update their software to either support M-series Macs exclusively or run universally on either chip. You can check an app’s compatibility by selecting the app’s icon and pressing Command+I on the keyboard. This will open a software info window, and in the General section, look at the listing for Kind. This will show one of the following:
Application (Apple silicon): The app was written for Apple chips
Application (Universal): The app was written for both Apple and Intel chips]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/perplexity-abandons-ai-advertising/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[AI company Perplexity is stepping away from advertising over concerns that it will erode user trust, despite moves by rivals to introduce ads as an alternative money-making strategy. Perplexity was one of the first AI services to embrace ads in 2024, after it ran tests where sponsored answers appeared under the chatbot's answers. That approach however was phased out last year, and executives at the company now say they don't plan to revisit it, according to the Financial Times. "A user needs to believe this is the best possible answer, to keep using the product and be willing to pay for it," a Perplexity executive told the publication. earlier this month to show ads to ChatGPT users who have a free account or a low-cost Go subscription. OpenAI has said ads will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides, nor will it provide advertisers with content from ChatGPT conversations. mocked OpenAI for its decision to show ads to users and has said it has no plans to do the same. The company argues that including ads in Claude would not be in line with its mission of creating a helpful assistant for work and deep thinking, and that users should not need to second-guess whether an AI is being helpful or "subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable." Google features advertising in AI mode and in its AI Overviews summaries on traditional search results. However, Google has not introduced ads into its Gemini chatbot so far. Tag: Perplexity

      <title><![CDATA[Can Eddy Cue break Apple’s slump?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3063746/can-eddy-cue-break-apples-slump.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Earlier this month, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple had scaled back its plans to launch a new Health+ service and was revisiting its entire health and fitness strategy.
While this could be seen as being another sign of trouble at Apple, as the company is currently mired in an ongoing narrative about its inability to ship AI features it promised nearly two years ago, I choose to see this as the opposite: a promising early sign that Apple’s executives are recognizing that its headlong charge into chasing services revenue might be coming at too high a cost.
The unlikely hero in all this? Apple’s services chief himself, Eddy Cue.
This isn’t good enough
At the end of last year, with the departure of former Apple COO Jeff Williams, Cue took over Apple’s health division. Even though Cue has been at Apple for a very long time, he was new to this group, and it seems to have made a difference. A new leader comes in with no ego invested in the path the group has been walking down, which makes it easier to see things fresh and not be afraid to make changes.
What Cue saw was a team that was busily preparing a new service, Health+, that offered AI-powered coaching features using data from Apple Health. His response seems to have been that, even for the guy whose job it is to grow and maintain Apple’s services business, the service being built was not compelling enough to launch.
But I think it goes deeper than that: The App Store has several apps that mine Apple Health data to generate AI-enhanced health information. What might have felt like an add-on feature a few years ago feels more like table stakes for Apple’s own Health app these days. And, according to Gurman, Cue has asked that a bunch of the features being built for Health+ just be rolled into the Health app.
It’s not Sherlocking
Is it wrong for Apple to look at other apps in the app store, like Athlytic, and realize that its basic, fundamental device features are lacking? This is the classic “Sherlocking” argument, but I don’t agree with it. There is a base level of functionality that Apple should be providing with every device it sells.]]></description>

They have power stations that hold enough energy to run entire houses for days or weeks at a time. But recently they have been bringing that same battery know-how to a smaller and more consumer-friendly form factor. They have expanded their lineup with the new Rapid Mag power bank product line. The star of the show is their new MagSafe power bank that combines Qi2.2 wireless charging, a built-in USB-C cable, and an integrated kickstand into a slim 10,000mAh design.

      <description><![CDATA[In the face of competition from Open AI and Meta, Apple is said to be redoubling its efforts to get a wearable pendant and camera-equipped AirPods right. A pin of the Apple Intelligence logo. Not an Apple Intelligence pin
In a bid to follow the AI marketplace trends, Apple is rumored to be working on a number of new products that take advantage of artificial intelligence. If a Tuesday report on the topic is correct, Apple is keen to make them a reality.
According to Bloomberg, Apple held an all-hands meeting earlier in February. During that meeting, CEO Tim Cook said that Apple was working to push hard on AI devices, and that the company is "extremely excited" about the new categories of products.

      <description><![CDATA[The 2026 revamp of Apple Intelligence and Siri is imminent, and Playlist Playground in iOS 26.4 shows Apple will continue to treat AI as a background tool, not a flagship feature. Apple Intelligence is meant to be a background feature
If you've been paying attention, Apple's strategy with artificial intelligence has always been about keeping it in the background. It augments human users rather than replacing them or stealing from them.
System-wide access to controls via app intents and the more personalized Siri won't or will be groundbreaking, depending on any given user's workflow. Apple isn't treating AI as some kind of world-altering paradigm that needs to overtake every part of the product. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Beta testers of the new macOS Tahoe 26.4 are getting warned that their favorite Intel-only apps won't work in macOS 28, because Rosetta 2 is getting killed. macOS will notify users of apps that will no longer work in the future
Rosetta 2 was introduced as a way to allow apps made for Intel chips to continue working on Apple Silicon. Over five years after its introduction in November 2020, Apple's warning users that it is going away.
As part of Monday's first developer beta build of macOS Tahoe 26.4, Apple has included a warning that tells users that some apps on their Mac will eventually stop working. In cases where users launch an app that relies on Rosetta 2, a warning will appear, advising that the app won't work when it pulls support for the translation layer.

      <description><![CDATA[A new Apple Intelligence feature is coming to iOS 26.4 called Playlist Playground, which will allow users to generate playlists using selected songs or text prompts. Apple Music is going to get a new Apple Intelligence feature
Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.4 on Monday, but it didn't include the rumored Apple Intelligence improvements. Instead, it seems to contain a range of user-facing features, including HLS video podcast support in Apple Podcasts and other updates.
Among the Apple Music updates was what initially appeared to be unused discovered by Macworld, which highlighted a potential incoming feature that could release along with iOS 26.4. The code is for something called Playlist Playground, which could be tied to Apple's new Apple Intelligence push. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation Siri still hasn't surfaced in shipping software, but the delay aligns more with staged rollout planning and strict reliability standards than with a stalled AI strategy. Apple is still teaching Siri to be a better assistant
Apple's long-promised Apple Intelligence overhaul of Siri still hasn't appeared in public builds, but the delay reflects deliberate pacing rather than a product in trouble.
The company reset expectations in 2025, announcing that a more personalized Siri with deeper app integration would come in 2026. Since then, reports have suggested that the original spring target faced some testing challenges. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Historically, Apple's March has been oddly busy in recent years, but as the company teases its newest "special Apple experience" happening on March 4, 2026, here's a look back at what we've seen before, and what we might see this time. Apple used to deck out conference halls for its launches —- this time for the iPad 3
That March 4, 2026 event is invitation-only one in New York, London, and Shanghai, and won't be streamed. It's being called an Apple Experience, too, which is the term the company used for the January 2026 event around the Apple Creator Studio .
If this a product announcement, though, then there is a precedent for it. And while there weren't even any Apple March events at all until 2008, since then they have been wide-ranging. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

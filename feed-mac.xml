      <description><![CDATA[It's not clear yet what this is for, but Apple is having an invite-only event not at Apple Park, but instead in New York City, on March 4. It might be time for all those M5 MacBook Pro, iPad, and iPhone 17e rumors to come true.

      <description><![CDATA[The long-awaited low-cost MacBook powered by an A18 Pro chip is now expected to launch on March 4. It will reportedly be priced somewhere around $700, making it significantly cheaper than an entry-level MacBook Air.
Given that the upcoming machine is likely to meet the needs of a great many of those who currently opt for the MacBook Air, it could cannibalize a lot of sales. One possible solution to this is to use the strategy Apple once adopted with the iBook and Powerbook lineups …

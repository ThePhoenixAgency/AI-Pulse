      <description><![CDATA[Historically, Apple's March has been oddly busy in recent years, but as the company teases its newest "special Apple experience" happening on March 4, 2026, here's a look back at what we've seen before, and what we might see this time. Apple used to deck out conference halls for its launches —- this time for the iPad 3
That March 4, 2026 event is invitation-only one in New York, London, and Shanghai, and won't be streamed. It's being called an Apple Experience, too, which is the term the company used for the January 2026 event around the Apple Creator Studio .]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's next event is happening on March 4, it's not at Apple Park. In Apple's marketing world, location definitely matters. Apple Park, where most Apple events take place
Whenever Apple announces a new event and sends out invitations, the immediate thought is that it is for the launch of a new product. The rumor mill is then immediately scoured for potential items to launch at the event.
What many industry observers don't immediately consider is where the event is taking place. The problem is, that historically has bearing on what Apple is about to say.]]></description>

Take the tech specs. We’re reasonably confident that the 17e will feature most or all of the following: an A19 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of starting storage (up from 128GB), a C1X modem, the same single 48MP rear-facing camera as on the 16e (although the selfie camera could get an upgrade), a 60Hz 6.1-inch screen, support for MagSafe, and a starting price of $599.]]></description>

Ten years ago on February 16, 2016, Apple drew a line in the sand. The FBI had cleverly and even callously timed an attack on the firm to take advantage of public outrage over the San Bernardino shootings.
Fourteen people had been murdered in a terrorist attack in California's San Bernardino in December 2015.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Historically, Apple's March has been oddly busy in recent years, but as the company teases its newest "special Apple experience" happening on March 4, 2026, here's a look back at what we've seen before, and what we might see this time. Apple used to deck out conference halls for its launches —- this time for the iPad 3
That March 4, 2026 event is invitation-only one in New York, London, and Shanghai, and won't be streamed. It's being called an Apple Experience, too, which is the term the company used for the January 2026 event around the Apple Creator Studio .]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's next event is happening on March 4, it's not at Apple Park. In Apple's marketing world, location definitely matters. Apple Park, where most Apple events take place
Whenever Apple announces a new event and sends out invitations, the immediate thought is that it is for the launch of a new product. The rumor mill is then immediately scoured for potential items to launch at the event.
What many industry observers don't immediately consider is where the event is taking place. The problem is, that historically has bearing on what Apple is about to say.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld It might seem like there’s a new rumor every week about when Apple’s first major product launch will arrive (sorry, AirTag 2), and it looks like we may finally have a firm date. This morning, Apple sent out invitations to a “special Apple experience” on March 4 at 9am ET.
Apple generally holds product launches at 1pm ET at its headquarters in Cupertino, so this is definitely a unique event. So far, at least three events will take place in New York, London, and Shanghai, all coordinated to occur at the same time.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The long-awaited low-cost MacBook powered by an A18 Pro chip is now expected to launch on March 4. It will reportedly be priced somewhere around $700, making it significantly cheaper than an entry-level MacBook Air.
Given that the upcoming machine is likely to meet the needs of a great many of those who currently opt for the MacBook Air, it could cannibalize a lot of sales. One possible solution to this is to use the strategy Apple once adopted with the iBook and Powerbook lineups … more…]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld At a certain point, disappointment gives way to fatalism. Last week, it emerged that Apple’s long-awaited Siri revamp has been delayed yet again, and my first reaction was to wonder if this even counted as news. Surely by now we’ve accepted that the new Siri is a phantasm, a trick of the light, a mythical creature like the Loch Ness Monster? Expecting it to actually launch would be as laughably naive as Charlie Brown expecting Lucy not to pull away the football at the last second.
Of course, being bleakly inevitable doesn’t actually disqualify something from being news.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Harken, if you will, back to a simpler time. A time when the Macalope’s columns were mostly concerned with dunking on people who said ridiculous things about Apple or Apple products.
What happened to those days, Carol? We were so young. So full of life. Did you ever finish making that dating app? It was for people in open relationships in gated communities. What a terrible idea. But such was our pie-eyed optimism! The future was spread out before us like a cruise ship buffet, but without the botulism.

      <description><![CDATA[Apple includes privacy indicators in the upper-right corner of your Mac’s display to indicate when critical hardware is in use. An orange indicator means your microphone is in use, while a green indicator suggests the camera is in use. These indicators help users stay diligent about apps that may be using the camera or microphone legitimately or, in the worst case, unscrupulously.
While I appreciate having these indicators, they can become a distraction when taking screenshots or recording my Mac’s external display.]]></description>

This like-new Apple MacBook Pro (2020) originally retailed for $1,999. Right now, it’s down to $469.97, which is the kind of price that makes upgrading feel way less dramatic.
Inside, you’re getting a 10th-gen Intel Core i7 processor clocked at 2.3GHz (with Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz), paired with 16GB of RAM and a fast 512GB SSD.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[When automating your smart home, much of the attention centers on cameras and lights, but I believe HomeKit door sensors are arguably among the most critical devices to add to your setup. I’ve written about Onvis before, but the Smart Security Alarm Contact Sensor (CS2) takes the concept of a simple door sensor and turns it into a lot more. It supports Thread, but the really cool add-on here is a 120dB siren built right into the sensor. Let’s take a look at the Onvis CS2.

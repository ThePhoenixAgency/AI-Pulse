      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple ships a simple but effective charging cable with the Apple Watch that will fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7 or later (Watch 8/9/10/11, Watch Ultra 1/2/3). You won’t find a faster charging accessory but you can also choose from a wide range of stylish and practical charging stands, docks and power banks for your Apple Watch—including some that can also charge other Apple devices such as your iPhone and AirPods.
Here, we round up the best Apple Watch chargers, docks and charging stands—some of which can charge your other Apple devices at the same time. Most should be compatible with all generations of the Watch, but be sure to check compatibility before buying.
See below the product chart for more on Apple Watch fast-charging, including the expected charging times of each Apple Watch.
There are simple charging cables, multi-device chargers that can power up your Apple Watch plus your iPhone and AirPods, chargers that are built for portability and travel, designer models that look great at home or in the office, and handy Apple Watch power banks.
While battery life has improved with the most recent Watch launches, particularly the Apple Watch 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3, you will still find yourself in need of recharging between one and two days.
We’ve tested a lot and selected our favorite Apple Watch chargers here.

Every Apple Watch comes with the company’s Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable. At $29 / £29 it’s not overly expensive to buy a spare or replacement, but there are more able multifunction Watch chargers available, as well as much cheaper simple cables that we would steer clear of but which we have investigated to see if we can find one we can recommend. First we start our best Apple Watch charger roundup with these simple models, and then we test the more functional and better-designed alternatives. Pros

Apple ships its Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable with its Watch Series 7 and later models, including the Watch Series 8/9/10/11, SE 3 and Watch Ultra. (Earlier Apple Watch SE models and Series 6 and earlier Watches shipped with the Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable that lacks the fast-charging function.)
Both charging cables are Apple white and a meter long. The latest version features an enhanced charging puck that also works with the case of the AirPods Pro 2 &amp; 3 and AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation.
The 7.5W Fast Charger Cable can charge 33% faster than the older 5W cable—charging a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in just 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will support eight hours of sleep tracking.
Without fast charge, it takes about 1.5 hours to charge an Apple Watch to 80%, and about 2.5 hours to 100%.
Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger, like you’d use to charge an iPhone; find our best iPhone chargers for a wider choice that the plain Apple 20W charger.
While you can still buy the older Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable, there’s little benefit as the newer Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable is backwards compatible with older Watch models, looks the same, and is the same price. You can use the old cable on a later Watch but obviously without fast charging. Pros

Apple’s official Watch Charger is fast and reliable but expensive compared to the knock-off Watch chargers you can find online. This is a shame as having a spare in your bag or lying around at home is useful given the Watch’s pretty dreadful battery life.
Usually there is a trusted third-party provider with an alternative to Apple’s simple charging cable but we could find none for the Apple Watch that were cheaper than the Apple version. We know that the Satechi USB-C Fast Charging Cable for Apple Watch is trustworthy as it’s from one of our favorite brands, but it’s actually pricier than the Apple—so why bother, unless you prefer the shorter cable?
There are some great third-party Apple Watch charging stands and adapters—many of which we review below. But you are taking a chance (albeit a very affordable chance) by picking a cheapo simple Watch charger from Amazon, Temu or other online retailers. We bought one from Amazon that frayed its cable sitting in a bag for a few weeks. If you must, then scan the user reviews but we can’t vouch that the good ones are genuine and others often state problems with durability and extremely slow charging. You spent a bunch on your Apple Watch so why risk it going up in flames by saving a few bucks on a spare charger? Pros

Small enough to fit in your pocket, this little 5W Watch charger from Satechi can plug straight into a USB-C charger or a USB-C charging port—for example, the Thunderbolt on your MacBook or iPad, a USB-C car charger, or USB-C output power bank.
As we all know, it’s not only the Apple Watch with a weak battery. This portable Watch Charger can also be used to charge AirPods in a compatible case.
When you get an alert telling you that your Watch battery is fading, you don’t always have your meter-long Apple charging cable with you but you are likely nearer a USB-C power point, and this little Watch charger can live at the bottom of your backpack for when you need it most. Pros

The Nimble Watch charging stand can fast-charge the Watch (Series 7 and later), and weighing just 3.2oz (91g) is portable, too. It is made from sustainable plant-based aloe leather.
The magnetic charging module allows the Watch to be raised to work either lying flat or in Nightstand mode. It ships with a separate 5-foot (1.5m) USB-C but requires a USB-C wall charger. Belkin An alternative is the larger (3.8 x 3.8 x 0.63 inches) and heavier (6.8oz) Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch, which is a long name for a fairly simple square, rubberized Apple Watch charging stand. It’s a little more expensive ($59.99), too, but it is available in white as well as black. Its built-in 4-foot (1.2m) USB-C cable wraps neatly around the underside of the dock, so keeping your space clutter-free. There’s a precision dial on the bottom of the dock to raise the puck height depending on the size of your Watch.
Alternatively, you can save money by buying one of the simple Apple Watch stands that require you to connect your Watch charging cable into the basic stand. Pros

If you own an Apple Watch there is a high possibility that you also own an iPhone, so why not have one versatile charger that can power up both Apple devices at the same time. Here are some of the favorites we have tested. Pros

Colors: Aluminum
USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included
Twelve South has triumphed with this pocketable 2-in-1 charger that can handle iPhone and Apple Watch (or Watch and AirPods), charging the two devices simultaneously.
It is fully Apple certified, so fast wirelessly charges the Watch at 5W and the iPhone at 15W. The Watch can’t be charged faster, although you can find 25W wireless chargers for the iPhone.
But its wonder is its clever, dinky foldable size and MacBook-like styling. Unfurl the charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed. You can even fold 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nightstand mode. Flip it round, and you can set the iPhone in landscape StandBy mode.
It chips with a super-compact 30W USB-C wall charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads: US, UK, EU and AU/NZ.
The ButterFly is also our favorite Apple Watch travel charger, but it works back at base just as well. Twelve South You can buy a different (a little pricier at $99.99) version in six different colors—the Twelve South ButterFly SE uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe, so also charges at 15W, but doesn’t ship with a wall charger. Its not metal like the original Butterfly but at least with its color choices (Black, White, Pink, Coastal Blue, Iridescent, Midnight Plum) it resembles more a butterfly than a moth. Pros

Colors: Sandstone, Black
USB-C charger: Not included (27W charger required)
Very similar to the Twelve South ButterFly, reviewed above, the Native Union Voyage is a touch larger but also a little lighter. In the same way, it’s a superb travel charger for iPhones after version 12 and Apple Watches. It can fast charge both as it uses 15W Qi2 for iPhone magnetic wireless charging (compared to the ButterFly’s 15W MagSafe but the same Qi2 standard as the ButterFly SE) and 5W for Apple Watch. AirPods can be charged on the Watch part depending on your charging needs.
It is so compact that it will easily fit in your pocket or get lost at the bottom of your backpack—the included pouch is handy in this regard, and something we hoped would be included with the ButterFly.
Like the ButterFly SE (but not the original ButterFly that ships with a 30W USB-C charger) it doesn’t come with a wall charger so you’ll need to add your own. And it is priced the same as the ButterFly SE.
It seems a shame to just compare this very neat 2-in-1 charger to the similar chargers that came before it. It does beat the Twelve South chargers in two respects. We think the Voyage will likely show less wear than the others as its silicone cover looks more hardy. And we like the fact you can just push out the Watch charging module from the back rather than risking your fingernail on the ButterFly’s notch.
Take a look at the Voyage and the ButterFly and ButterFly SE, and make your choice. You won’t be disappointed with any of these dinky and cleverly designed 2-in-1 chargers. Pros

The BoostCharge Pro looks rather like a paperweight and will delight interior designers.
Compact and low-level in an elegant organic shape, the bulb-like charging stand is made from at least 60% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic and has pleasingly soft edges and a texture that makes you stroke it longingly.
The chrome Watch-charging pad sticks out from the back of the stand, and can’t be folded in when not in use, as is possible with some compact multi-device chargers such as the Anker 3-in-1 Cube. It features fast wireless charging for both Watch and iPhone. While it lacks an AirPods charging module like the 3-in-1 charging stations reviewed here, you can charge the AirPods wireless charging case on the top when the charging pad is flat and not charging your iPhone.

Belkin created not one but two UltraCharge Pro Convertible chargers; see also the review below. Both fold up to create a pocketable charging pad and can be unfolded to make a viewing stand. Only this version—they’re both called the same thing so bear with me—can charge both iPhone and Watch when partially folded up.
While not as design-mag gorgeous as the BoostCharge Pro Charging Dock reviewed above, the super-portable UltraCharge Pro Convertible is a foldable compact design marvel nonetheless.
Belkin designates its 15W iPhone chargers as “BoostCharge” and its 25W models as “UltraCharge”. Both will charge the Apple Watch at the same 5W but owners of the iPhone 16 and 17 series will cut around 15 minutes off their charging time with the 25W variety. Pros

It’s got the same name and near identical functions and technical specification as the Belkin UltraCharge Pro Convertible reviewed above, so the choice is all yours and may come down to price. This slightly pricier version is classier with its chrome bar and maybe that’s why Apple chose to sell this model in its Store. It’s also a bit heavier, making the cheaper version better suited to travel.
As the Watch-charging module is folded away under the pad, you can’t charge your Watch while it’s in Pad mode as you can with its non-identical twin. Pros

We list this elegant charging stand as a 2-in-1 because it can charge two types of Apple device: the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, you could argue that it’s a 3-in-1 as it has dual Watch charging pads for families or offices with more than one Apple wearable and can therefore charge two separate devices at the same time.
For such households this charger will help eliminate the need for messy individual charging cables. Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone/AirPod chargers
As well as owning an Apple Watch and iPhone, a fair few of us have further swelled Apple’s coffers by buying AirPods. These are the 3-in-1 chargers that we have tested and approve for simultaneously charging Apple Watch, Apple iPhone and Apple AirPods (with a wireless charging case). Pros

If you’ve got an Apple Watch, chances are you also own an iPhone and maybe a set of AirPods, too. Here’s where a charging station, which can power up all three devices simultaneously, becomes essential if you want to rid yourself of a snake’s nest of cables.
Previously, 3-in-1 chargers were limited to 15W wireless charging either via Apple’s MagSafe or Qi2. Apple’s own iPhone MagSafe Charger has alone been able to charge iPhone 16 and later at 25W. The new Qi2 25W standard, however, means you can get the fastest magnetic charging in a stand without needing to rig it with Apple’s charging puck. In our real-world tests using the iOS 26 beta on our iPhone 16 Pro, we saw actual charging times from 0 to 50 percent of 30-35 minutes, measurably faster than 15W MagSafe.
As with the 25W MagSafe, Qi2 25W requires at least an iPhone 16 running iOS 26 to hit the top wireless charging speed. It and this stand is backwards compatible with older iPhones going back to the iPhone 12 but is pegged back at Qi2’s older 15W limit for those iPhones.
Here we are just as interested in the UltraCharge Pro’s Apple Watch-charging prowess and this is as fast as it gets at 5W.
The base is wrapped in a beautifully soft-touch silicone, while the bar that holds the iPhone and Watch chargers look great in a shiny chrome finish. It’s not the highest stand, but the iPhone charging pad is highly adjustable— up to 70 degrees in portrait or landscape—so it can be angled as you desire. Pros

The HiRise 3 Deluxe (available at Apple) can wirelessly charge three devices—iPhone 12/13/14/15/16/17 (but not SE), Apple Watch 7, 8, 9, SE and Ultra, and Apple AirPods (2nd and 3rd gen AirPods, and all AirPods Pro). The AirPods-charging Qi wireless pad can alternatively be used to charge any iPhone from iPhone 8 up.
The iPhone 15W, Watch 5W and Qi pad 7.5W charging points allow for fast charging, but that 15W iPhone charger is now bested by Qi2 25W chargers as found on the Belkin UltraCharge Pro 3-in-1 stand reviewed above.
The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, and the iPhone in iOS 17’s StandBy mode. You can angle the iPhone by up to 35 degrees. Pros

If you own an Apple Watch it’s a fair bet that you also have an iPhone, and, go on admit it, some AirPods, too—you’re well invested into the Apple ecosystem.
This 3-in-1 charging station from Journey has a tiltable MagSafe-certified pad (15W) for all iPhones 12/13/14/15, plus a Qi charger for AirPods that have a wireless charging case.
Important to us here, though, is the Apple Watch charger at the back, which can fast-charge your Apple wearable.
The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is similar and features a tiltable Watch charger at the front rather than the back. If you want a 3-in-1 fast charging stand in white, then pick this Journey stand or the OtterBox 3-in-1 reviewed below; if you prefer black, go for the Charcoal Belkin UltraCharge Pro.
There is a cheaper version, the Journey Trio 3-in-1 Charging Station, which features a handy detachable Watch charger that you can slip into your pocket and plug into a USB-C charger, including your MacBook, away from the base unit. While that is a neat feature (and might save you $40 on a standalone Watch adapter) the MagSafe pad is only compatible so charges the iPhone at 7.5W and the Watch charger is slower than the one featured on the Trio Ultra 3-in-1.

The first 3-in-1 device charger based on the fast MagSafe-like 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging tech, the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station not only boosts wireless charging speeds that match Apple’s MagSafe but wraps up everything into a solid, foldable and compact yet flexible design. Apple Watch fast charging is the cream on the top.
Foldable and super compact, the Anler MagGo Wireless Charging Station is a great portable option for your travels. The Watch-charging module neatly folds into the base of the charging station. It’s just as great as a permanent charger at home.
We also like Anker’s 3-in-1 Cube, reviewed below—but while it’s gorgeous, it is heavier than the MagGo and doesn’t feature Watch fast charging.
If you can live without the MagSafe wireless charging iPhone stand element, we are rather in love with another Apple Watch charger from the same company, which is also a power bank: the Anker MagGo 10K Power Bank For Apple Watch, reviewed below in our Best Apple Watch Power Banks reviews. Pros

Belkin’s Boost Up Charge Pro Wireless Charging Pad 3-in-1 charger (available at Apple) is the fastest way you can wirelessly charge both your Apple Watch and iPhone (12/13/14/15/16-series models), plus AirPods that come in a wireless charging case. It’s a flat pad so the iPhone charges lying down rather than visible as it would be on a stand.
It boasts both Watch fast charging (7.5W) and iPhone MagSafe fast charging (15W). The included 20W USB-C wall charger is a little underpowered if charging all three devices simultaneously. A 30W or 40W charger would better handle that situation.
The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, but because the iPhone lies flat you can’t take advantage of iOS 17’s StandBy mode. The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is a better option if you want to view your iPhone while it’s charging—and it also comes with a more powerful 40W power supply.
The magnetic charging module features a precision dial that can adjust the height for the best Watch, depending on the screen size. Pros

Matching the Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe in terms of charging speed, the OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station is a super-fast iPhone/Watch/AirPods charger with a small footprint—indeed, it’s a little smaller than its rival.
The charging points for iPhone and Apple Watch are fully certified—iPhone 15W and Watch 5W. At 5W, the lower Qi pad is slower than the Twelve South.
We prefer the HiRise 3 Deluxe for its tilting iPhone MagSafe pad and more flexible Watch module. But if the white color option fits your decor better than the black-only HiRise, the OtterBox 3-in-1 is a great choice. Best Apple Watch travel chargers

      <description><![CDATA[Six skiers who survived the avalanche near Lake Tahoe on Tuesday used the Emergency SOS via satellite feature on the iPhone to get help, reports The New York Times. Emergency SOS via satellite lets ‌iPhone‌ users communicate with emergency responders via text when a cellular or Wi-Fi connection is not available. The skiers were able to stay connected to the Nevada County Sheriff's Office for several hours while rescue efforts were coordinated. "One of my personnel was communicating with one of the guides over a four-hour period, giving information back to the Nevada sheriff's office and coordinating what rescues could be permitted," said Don O'Keefe, law enforcement chief for California's Office of Emergency Services. Apple Watch Ultra 3. Apple offers the functionality for free. car accidents to wild fires. The feature works in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S.

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple’s MacBook lineup could be in for a major shakeup. The company is reportedly planning on releasing a new, low-cost laptop that can compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops in the budget market. Such a laptop could bring the Mac to a whole new class of users.
The new MacBook may feature an aluminum design in playful colors, an A19 Pro chip, Ultra Retina XDR OLED display, fewer ports, and Apple’s C2 modem. This new, low-cost MacBook could be a very popular one, which means you’ll want to keep track of its developments. Well, look no further. This article will keep track of the rumors and reports of this upcoming product, as well as offer our perspective on the device, so keep an eye on this page for the latest. New A19 MacBook: Release date
March 4, 2026 – possible Apple is scheduled to host three “Apple Special Experiences” on March 4 in the U.S., U.K., and China. These sessions, which are expected to offer media hands-on time with new products, could provide the ideal setting for the budget MacBook’s debut.
Apple’s low-cost MacBook has been rumored for some time, with Apple leaker Jon Prosser describing a new colorful MacBook Air back in May 2021, that never materialised, but over the past year rumors have remerged suggesting that Apple does have something different coming. In June 2025, credible analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, indicated (in Chinese) that Apple would start production of the new low-cost MacBook at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025 or in the early stage of the first quarter of 2026. It’s worth emphasising that those dates refer to the manufacturing process rather than the announcement or shipping timeframe. If production began in October 2025 then it’s plausible that the budget MacBook will arrive in early 2026, potentially unveiled at a spring event, or in the run up to Apple’s March 4 ‘Experience’. In November, 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning to release a “low-cost laptop to rival Chromebooks and Windows PCs” in the first half of 2026. He said it was currently in testing at Apple and “in early production with overseas suppliers.”
On February 8, 2026, Gurman reported that the low-cost MacBook will be available “in the first half of the year.” He did not offer any specifics. And then, on February 15, he wrote that Apple’s long-rumored low-cost MacBook is expected to arrive “as early as March,” with a design that defies its price tag. What will the new MacBook be called? MacBook (probably)
No reports have been made about the official name of the laptop, but you can assume it won’t be part of the MacBook Air line. It’s being referred to as the A18 or A19 Pro MacBook, based on the chip it could have. Apple could simply call it “MacBook,” reviving the name of the discontinued 12-inch MacBook that was targeted at a similar market. Apple last updated the MacBook in 2017.
Foundry New A19 MacBook: Design
Playful colors
Aluminum chassis (not plastic) According to Mark Gurman (in February 2026), Apple’s low-cost MacBook will have a design that defies its price tag. Apple’s goal with this laptop is to make it affordable compared to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, and one way to cut costs is to make a plastic case instead of an aluminum one. However, since Apple is working to make its products carbon-neutral, it’s doubtful that it would use plastic, preferring to use aluminum or some other recyclable or carbon-free material. Therefore, it is no surprise that the new MacBook, according to Gurman, will have an aluminum chassis. There will be a new manufacturing process “designed to be both faster and more cost-effective than the one used with Apple’s current laptops,” according to Gurman. Along with the aluminum shell, Gurman reports that the new MacBook will be available in “playful colors.”
The following colours are indicated: yellow, light green, blue, silver, dark gray, and pink. Which, in the case of yellow, green and blue, does seem to match the logo Apple designed for the invites to the special events on March 4. Apple Back in June 2023 analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested the following colors: silver, blue, pink, and yellow. A19 Pro MacBook: Display
12.9-inch display – rumored
Apple currently uses a Liquid Retina (LED-backlit display with IPS technology) display in the MacBook Air, an upgrade over the original Retina displays Apple last used with the 13-inch MacBook Pro in 2022. It’s possible Apple could revert to a Retina display with squared-off corners for the A19 Pro MacBook, though it’s more likely that Apple shaves cost by using a smaller display.
On August 11, DigiTimes reported that the laptop will have a 12.9-inch display, slightly smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air. New A19 MacBook: Processor
iPhone chip: A19 Pro or A18 Pro – expected
Another way to meet the pricing goals for this new MacBook is to use a chip that isn’t as robust as the chips used in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. When Kuo first discussed the budget MacBook in his June 2025 report, he stated that Apple will use an A18 Pro, the same chip that was in the iPhone 16 Pro. Now that the A19 arrived with the iPhone 17 this is probably the more likely chip. about what the iPhone 17 can tell us about the MacBook that could use the same chip in: Is Apple’s rumored cheap MacBook hiding in plain sight? The A-series chips are used in iPhones, while M-series chips are in Macs. Both chip families are based on the same general architecture, but the M chips generally offer more processing power.
An A19 Pro (and A18 Pro) can technically do everything an M-series chip can, but it will be slower. When comparing Geekbench 6 benchmarks, the A18 Pro offered single-core performance that’s on par with the M3. However, because the A18 Pro has only 6 CPU cores, its multi-core performance is slightly behind the M1, which has 8 CPU cores. If Apple keeps everything the same, an A18 Pro MacBook will perform like an M1 MacBook Air, which, for a lot of people, has more than enough processing power. Should Apple use an A19 Pro we can expect something even better. It will draw comparison with the iPad models that are powered by Mac chips, though. MacRumors reported, in December 2025, that references to an A18 Pro MacBook appeared in a set of leaked Apple files.
New A19 MacBook: Connectivity
Apple is using its own wireless networking chip, the N1 in the iPhone 17, bringing Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 7, and Thread. It’s likely the same chips will make their way into the A19 Pro MacBook. There’s also a chance this new Mac will have cellular connectivity using Apple’s C1, C1X or yet to launch C2 modem. The C2 is likely to support mmWave. Aside from this, it’s rumored that the budget MacBook will have fewer USB ports than the MacBook Air (which has two USB-C and a magsafe charging port). This low-cost MacBook may not support Thunderbolt. New A19 MacBook: Camera
No camera?
It’s also possible that Apple opts not to include a built-in camera. Over the past several years, Apple has promoted the Mac’s Continuity Camera feature that lets you use an iPhone as a Mac webcam, as well as the upcoming macOS Tahoe Magnifier app. Apple could promote this as a webcam solution. This would be a drastic change, since it’s been a long time since Apple shipped a laptop without a camera, but it could be a possibility in order to meet the company’s price goal. New A19 MacBook: Performance Results are expressed as Geekbench scores. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. We don’t yet have the benchmarks for the A19 Pro, but the A18 Pro has 8GB of RAM, which Apple has said is the bare minimum required to run Apple Intelligence features. So, this new laptop will have at least 8GB of RAM and possibly 16GB, like the other MacBook models. Since the iPhone doesn’t offer RAM upgrades, we don’t know what Apple could charge for extra memory.
As for graphics performance, the A18 Pro has a 6-core GPU, and its Metal score in Geekbench 6’s Compute benchmark is similar to that of the M1 found in the MacBook Air. It’s not a cutting-edge performer, but it’ll handle everyday tasks without any issues. Since Apple’s other MacBooks all start at 256GB of storage, it’s nearly certain this model will come with 256GB of storage as well. New A19 MacBook: Price
The cheapest laptop Apple sells is the $999 MacBook Air. However, Walmart still sells the M1 MacBook Air with a 256GB SSD for $649 and as low as $599. The A19 Pro MacBook has been thought of as a replacement for this Walmart model, though it’s hard to believe it would be that cheap. A price that falls between $729 and $849 seems like it would fit into the MacBook lineup.
There are claims that the low-cost MacBook could start at $599, which could allow Apple to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops. Gurman reports that the new laptop will cost “well under $1,000.”
Our estimation would be around the middle of those two figures, around $749. @macworld.com A cheap MacBook…or something else. A rumor says that Apple is going to release a cheap laptop, but what if it’s actually the long-rumored iPad/Mac hybrid we’ve heard about?

      <title><![CDATA[Apple's Low-Cost Colorful MacBook: All the Rumors]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/low-cost-macbook-latest-rumors/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple has been developing a more affordable version of the MacBook, and it's rumored to be launching in under two weeks. This is going to be one of Apple's most unique Macs, because there hasn't really been anything quite like it before. We've rounded up everything we know about the low-cost MacBook ahead of its March debut. Design Rumors about the MacBook's design make it sound a lot like the MacBook Air. It will have an aluminum chassis in various colors, and a 12.9-inch or 13-inch display, depending on the rumor. It's possible the low-cost MacBook will have a thin and light design because it's going to use a lower power A-series chip that doesn't require a lot of heat dissipation, but that's not yet confirmed. Apple used to have a 12-inch MacBook with a thin design and a low-power Core M chip, and it's been suggested that this new MacBook could be something of a revival of that machine. Thinner and lighter typically means more expensive with Apple products, so a super slim design might not be what Apple is optimizing for. Making the low-cost MacBook thinner than the ‌MacBook Air‌ could just confuse the MacBook lineup. iPad, Apple keeps the price down by using older display technology that's not as thin, so we could see that same strategy with the low-cost MacBook. A thicker chassis and a super efficient chip could mean a long battery life, which would be ideal for an educational environment. Colors The MacBook is going to come in a selection of fun colors, and Apple has tested light yellow, light green, blue, pink, silver, and dark gray, according to Bloomberg. Not all of those colors are likely to ship, but it sounds like we'll get at least four of them. Ming-Chi Kuo thinks the MacBook will come in yellow, silver, blue, and pink, which would be the same colors that Apple offers for the ‌iPad‌. A-Series Chip The most consistent rumor we've heard about the MacBook is its planned chip. Rather than an M-series Mac chip, Apple is planning to use an A-series chip. The low-cost MacBook is expected to use the A18 Pro chip, which Apple first debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro. The A18 Pro uses a second-generation 3-nanometer process. It has a 6-core CPU with four performance cores and two efficiency cores, along with a 6-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine for AI-based tasks. In Geekbench benchmarks, the A18 Pro has an average single-core score of 3451, and a multi-core score of 8572. For comparison, the M4 iPad Pro earns a single-core score of 3694 and a multi-core score of 13732 (Apple's next ‌MacBook Air‌ is going to use the M4 chip). M1, which is the chip that Apple kept around in a lower-cost version of the ‌MacBook Air‌ for several years. An A18 MacBook wouldn't be too far off from the M4 Mac/‌iPad‌ chips in terms of single-core performance, but there would be a difference in multi-core performance. iPhone or ‌iPad‌ can do. Apple is developing the low-cost MacBook with students in mind, and it sounds like it will be the Apple equivalent of the affordable Chromebook PCs that are often used by students. RAM Macs start with 16GB RAM, but the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro has 8GB RAM, the minimum for Apple Intelligence. We can expect an A18 Pro MacBook to have at least 8GB RAM so it can support ‌Apple Intelligence‌, but it's possible Apple will give it the 16GB that all Macs have. Storage The ‌MacBook Air‌ starts with 256GB of storage, but Apple could possibly launch the low-cost MacBook with 128GB. Ports The A18 Pro chip in the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models doesn't support Thunderbolt, so the MacBook will be limited to USB-C (10GB/s) and won't offer Thunderbolt speeds. That will limit display connectivity, so it's likely the A18 Pro MacBook will only support a single external display. Naming It's not really clear what Apple will name the low-cost Mac notebook. We have the ‌MacBook Air‌ and the MacBook Pro, so it's entirely possible it will be called "MacBook." Apple has used the MacBook name multiple times in the past, and it's not in use at the moment. Price Pricing on the ‌MacBook Air‌ starts at $999, and the low-cost MacBook is expected to be priced much lower. iPad Air with M2 chip starts at $599. A price between $599 and $799 could make the most sense because it wouldn't be as expensive as the ‌MacBook Air‌ or ‌iPad Pro‌, but would come in at or just over the ‌iPad Air‌'s cost. iPhone 16e, Apple's most affordable ‌iPhone‌ that uses a slightly less powerful A18 chip. Launch Date Rumors suggest that the low-cost MacBook will be introduced at or just before Apple's March 4 Special Experience that's taking place in New York, London, and Shanghai. Apple could announce the MacBook in a press release ahead of the experience. This article, "Apple's Low-Cost Colorful MacBook: All the Rumors" first appeared on MacRumors.com

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/jony-ive-openai-smart-speaker-2027/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[OpenAI is working on several AI hardware devices in partnership with former Apple designer Jony Ive, and the first product that comes out could be a smart speaker. The company is developing a smart speaker, a smart lamp, and considering AI glasses, according to The Information, with the speaker set to come out in early 2027. OpenAI's smart speaker has an integrated camera and it is designed to learn information about who is using it and what's around them. It will include a facial recognition feature similar to Face ID, and users will be able to use the speaker to make purchases. The speaker will have AI integration, so users can ask it questions and make requests. In an internal presentation, OpenAI employees were told that the speaker would observe users and suggest actions to help them achieve goals, such as suggesting an early bedtime ahead of a morning meeting. Siri that Apple is developing. OpenAI is planning to price the speaker between $200 and $300, with a launch planned for February 2027 at the earliest. OpenAI is exploring a smart lamp and smart glasses, but those products won't be ready until 2028 or later. With the exception of the speaker, OpenAI's hardware development is in the early stages and other products could be canceled. acquired Ive's hardware firm io in May 2025. Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have shared some details on their AI hardware work, suggesting that there was an established prototype in November 2025. At the time, Ive and Altman said the device would be "peaceful" and an "active participant" that's not annoying. The duo also described the device as a product that would "make people feel joy." an employee meeting, where Ive and Altman said they didn't want a device with a screen. The device, which is presumably the speaker that The Information says is in development, was described as pocket-sized and contextually aware of the user's surroundings. Altman told employees it's "the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen." iPhone, there is some internal tension at OpenAI. Ive's LoveFrom design company has remained separate from OpenAI, but LoveFrom is providing hardware designs to OpenAI. It's up to OpenAI's hardware and software engineers to actually make the products that LoveFrom comes up with. Eddy Cue's son Adam Cue is working on OpenAI software.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/macos-26-3-code-three-new-apple-products/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[macOS 26.3 hints at Apple's rumored lower-cost MacBook, and two new Studio Display models, according to Macworld's Filipe Espósito. Espósito found the following codenames within macOS 26.3's source code, and he revealed the upcoming products that they likely correspond with, based on previous reporting from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and others. J700: Lower-cost MacBook J427: A new Studio Display J527: A new, higher-end Studio Display
This is far from the first time that these codenames have been spotted in Apple's software updates. According to MacRumors contributor Aaron Perris, the codenames were also present in updates such as macOS 26.2 and iOS 18.5 last year. more and more hints stack up, it is clear that all three products are inching closer to release. in the first week of March. The media would then receive hands-on time with the laptop during the "Apple Experience" in New York, London, and Shanghai on Wednesday, March 4 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time. in the first half of 2026, but it is unclear if they will be part of the announcements in the first week of March. The lower-cost MacBook is rumored to be powered by a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip, rather than an M-series chip. The laptop will apparently be available in a variety of bright colors, such as yellow, green, blue, and/or pink. Other rumored specs include a 12.9-inch display and 8GB of RAM. The starting price remains to be seen, with estimates ranging from $599 to $799 in the United States. from 2015 to 2019. 27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting, up to a 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and an A19 chip or A19 Pro chip. No major design changes are expected. If the next Studio Display receives mini-LED backlighting and HDR support, its maximum brightness and contrast ratio would be higher than the current model. And a newer A19 or A19 Pro chip — up from the A13 Bionic currently — should contribute to performance improvements, camera-related enhancements, and more. There are no details about the second Studio Display. Presumably, it would be a higher-end model, and we can only dream of a larger 32-inch screen size.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066931/dwindling-m1-air-stock-points-to-imminent-release-of-a-budget-macbook.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple’s long-rumored cheap MacBook appears to have come a step closer to launch, with the discovery that Walmart has stopped selling new units of the low-cost M1 MacBook Air.
As first reported by PC Mag, searching for the late-2020 machine on the U.S. site with the “new” filter checked brings up three buying options: the 256GB in Space Gray or gold, and a listing for the 512GB model, which hasn’t been available since 2024. All three now show as out of stock for shipping, and the reporter was able to find just one store in his local area with units for pickup. I had a similar experience. I’m out of luck, and they’re out of stock.
David Price / Foundry (As a side note, I’ve been unable to find new units of the M1 Air in any other stores close to me, including Amazon. If you check the price-comparison table below, you’ll see if there are any in your location. If the table isn’t showing up at all, that means you’re out of luck, too.)
Retailer Price Check Product Price It isn’t clear how long Walmart has been short of stock for this machine, but we know it was on sale for the bargain price of $549 as recently as mid-December. As it’s unlikely that Walmart just happened to run out of stock after two years, it seems Apple and Walmart have decided to wind down sales.
While the decision could be related to cost-cutting measures due to memory prices ballooning, this timing adds credence to the rumors of a cheap MacBook expected within the next two weeks. Apple recently announced global “experiences” on March 4, and it’s widely rumored that it will announce a series of new entries in its iPhone, iPad, and MacBook lines in the days leading up to that. Rumors about the new MacBook claim it will use an A18 Pro iPhone chip and cost around $699, both reasons to stop selling these M1 models. Whatever the truth, we should find out soon.

      <title><![CDATA[Rumored Colors for Low-Cost MacBook Were Originally Tested for 2022 MacBook Air Redesign]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/20/low-cost-macbook-colors-2022-air-redesign/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple tested color options for the 2022 MacBook Air redesign that are said to be similar to the finishes planned for its forthcoming low-cost MacBook, according to a Chinese leaker. Apple is expected to announce its rumored low-cost MacBook at an event on March 4, with the device coming in a selection of bold color options that are believed to include yellow, green, and blue – as seen on Apple's invite graphic. Instant Digital" says Apple originally planned to offer the same kind of light, playful color scheme for the MacBook Air with M2 chip. October 2021, a proven leaker claimed the redesigned MacBook Air would come in color options that are similar to the 24-inch iMac, but it didn't happen. The model eventually dropped in July 2022 in silver, starlight, space gray, and midnight colors. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said the colors Apple has tested for its budget MacBook so far include light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray, although he says it's unlikely all of them will ship. If the colorful palette is unveiled, it would make the budget MacBook the most colorful laptop Apple has offered since the iBook G3 era in the late 90s. Apple offered the machines in Tangerine, Blueberry, Indigo, Graphite, and Key Lime. Ming-Chi Kuo, the low-cost machine will retail for well under $1,000 and run an iPhone chip – potentially the A18 Pro – rather than an M-series processor. It will feature a slightly-under-13-inch display and an aluminum chassis, which is being built using a new, faster manufacturing process that Apple developed to keep costs down, according to Gurman. announced a "special Apple Experience" for the media in New York, London, and Shanghai, taking place on March 4, 2026 at 9:00am ET, when we're hoping to get a glimpse of the new machine.

      <title><![CDATA[The retro iPod that never was]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066316/the-retro-ipod-that-never-was.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple is known for being secretive about what goes on inside its offices, whether it’s about upcoming products or things from the past. Still, from time to time, we get a glimpse into internal projects that were never meant to see the light of day. What if we told you that Apple once considered launching a “retro iPod”?
Thanks to newly published material by former Apple designer Jon Stoa, we now have a fascinating glimpse into never-before-seen marketing concepts. They not only show scrapped plans for the 2007 iPhone launch, but also concepts for what would have been a special edition iPod classic.
An iPod inspired by the 1984 Macintosh
On his resume webpage, which includes several images for ads, packaging elements, and marketing images created while working at Apple, Stoa shares some of the unreleased projects he worked on at Apple between 2006 and 2008. The most intriguing is the concept for a limited edition “retro iPod,” which would be designed to look like it came straight out of 1984.
The idea was heavily based on a growing trend of nostalgia, even 20 years ago. The material imagines an iPod based on the design of the original Macintosh with a beige finish, classic typography, and the rainbow Apple logo on the back. He writes that the device “would draw from both the present and the past to make a statement about the role of Apple and the iPod in culture, both now and then.” Apple proposed a series of names for its retro “1984” iPod. Jon Stoa Suggested names included iPod retro, iPod rewind, iPod beta, and iPod backspace, all rendered in Apple Garamond, the typography used in Apple’s marketing materials at the time.
The concept went far beyond a vintage design. The marketing material proposed preloading the iPod with some music videos from the 1980s and even classic arcade games such as Pac-Man. Distribution would have been limited, with the retro iPod only available at Apple Stores and selected boutique partners.
There’s no evidence Apple ever developed prototypes for the retro iPod. The materials appear to be unused design and marketing explorations rather than a cancelled product.
Still, the fact that someone inside Apple considered making a vintage edition of the iPod (which was at its peak in 2006) is fascinating. A retro iPod is unlikely to happen now, but it would make an intriguing device. Jon Stoa Could a retro iPod happen in 2026?
Apple officially killed the iPod brand in 2022 when it discontinued the iPod touch, but the more classic iPod nano and iPod shuffle disappeared years earlier. Even so, some people are still calling for the return of the iPod in some form.
Some fans would instantly buy an iPod classic, while others would like a reimagined version of the iPod that blends today’s technologies with the essence of the original iPod.
If Apple were to revisit the idea today, it likely wouldn’t be a straight reissue. Instead, we could imagine a compact device the size of the iPod classic, but built with today’s materials and components. A modern OLED or mini-LED display, haptic feedback to simulate the tactile feel of the Click Wheel, expanded storage options, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support, and deep integration with Apple Music.
Whether Apple would embrace this idea of looking back at its hardware is another question. The company typically prefers to move forward and rarely celebrates milestones such as product anniversaries. But it’s hard to imagine a limited-edition device like this not selling out instantly. The Apple Store cube on 5th Avenue in New York City could have had a light projection show ahead of the iPhone’s launch. Jon Stoa The canceled iPhone event
Stoa’s material also sheds light on Apple’s pre-launch strategy for the original iPhone.
According to the documents, Apple had considered hosting another press event on June 26, 2007, just three days before the iPhone officially went on sale. The event was to be held at The California Theatre in San Jose. Attendees would have received an iPhone-shaped gift card to spend on the iTunes Store.
However, the event never happened.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/m1-macbook-air-out-of-stock-at-walmart/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple's older MacBook Air with the M1 chip is now out of stock on Walmart's website in the U.S., amid rumors of a new lower-cost MacBook coming soon. A colorful MacBook (concept) Walmart first began selling the MacBook Air with the M1 chip for $699 in March 2024. The price later dropped to $649, then to $599, and briefly to as low as $549 during a Black Friday sale last year. However, we just noticed that it has been out of stock for a while now, and there is no indication if it will ever be returning. Apple first released the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020, as one of the first Macs with an Apple silicon chip, instead of an Intel processor. The configuration being sold by Walmart for as low as $549 included 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. They were new-in-box units, not refurbished or open-box models. Walmart's website continues to offer refurbished units from "trusted sellers" for as low as $449. discontinued the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in 2024, after it launched models with the M3 chip, and it has since updated the MacBook Air with the M4 chip. Prior to being discontinued, the model with the M1 chip was being sold for a starting price of $999 brand new, but Amazon sometimes offered it on sale for $749 to $899. The laptop going out of stock at Walmart could be a hint. plans to release a lower-priced MacBook with a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip as early as the first week of March, according to several reports and leakers. This would be an all-new model positioned below the MacBook Air in the Mac lineup, and it would mark a revival of the "MacBook" brand (with no "Air" or "Pro" designation). green, blue, pink, and/or yellow. A few rumors have specifically said it will have a 12.9-inch screen. discontinued 12-inch MacBook, including an ultra-thin and lightweight design. However, that model was powered by Intel processors. Apple stopped selling the 12-inch MacBook in July 2019, so there has been a long wait for a similar model powered by Apple silicon. In the iPhone 16 Pro, the A18 Pro chip has a 6-core CPU and a 6-core GPU. The chip's multi-core performance is similar to the M1 chip, so this new MacBook could effectively be a replacement for the MacBook Air with the M1 chip, and that could explain why it is finally out of stock at Walmart ahead of the lower-cost MacBook launching. Skyrocketing DRAM and NAND storage chip prices may have been a factor too, though. Related Roundup: MacBook Air

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066138/no-apple-wont-drop-usb-c-from-the-iphone-18.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Most iPhone fans are currently focused on the imminent launch of the iPhone 17e, which could be here in a matter of days. But one dubious rumor doing the rounds on social media right now concerns a flagship phone from the next generation. It’s just a shame that it’s almost certainly wrong.
This TikTok video, which at the time of writing has been viewed more than 17 million times, purports to show the charging port of the iPhone 18. (Or “iPhone18,” as it’s labelled by the clearly knowledgeable maker.) But rather than the USB-C port, which has been used on all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 15 in 2023, the animation shows something more akin to the MagSafe connector that appears on newer MacBooks. This video might look cool, but it’s not going to happen. TikTok The charging cable, which has a rather nice black braided cord, attaches via a magnetic connection. When it’s in place a green LED lights up on the charger head, and a small green lightning bolt is shown at the bottom of the previously blank phone screen. (Never mind that iPhones don’t behave like this; it’s the least of our worries.) It looks very similar to the MagSafe cable on my 2021 MacBook Pro, except with three pins instead of five and a chunkier body.
Now, the video doesn’t list its sources; we don’t get the usual “supply-chain sources” or “people with knowledge of the matter.” It’s just an animation. So in some ways it’s quite difficult to refute: where did this information come from? Who said this was likely? Is this simply a concept that an illustrator dreamed up, like this animation from the same channel showing possible iPhone 18 Pro colors?
Whatever the video’s intention, it’s getting major traction from viewers who think it’s real. A quick browse through a handful of the 9,700-odd reveals viewer after viewer complaining about Apple’s foolishness in doing this, or the impracticality of the design. A few appear to be Android fans mocking iPhone users for their misfortune. I couldn’t find any pointing out that this is extraordinarily unlikely to happen.
Because, as several commenters argue, it wouldn’t be a practical solution. It would disconnect very easily, and unlike on the MacBook, disconnecting easily isn’t necessary to protect it from a specific type of accident. It would annoy customers and accessories makers. And it could create problems with the EU, who mandated USB-C connectors on all smartphones sold in its territory.
What may have happened is that someone has got confused between MagSafe on the iPhone and MagSafe on the Mac. They’re both charging standards that use a magnetic connection to keep the charging points in place, but in most other respects they’re totally different. (For example, the phone’s magnetic connection is stronger so that it remains connected if you nudge the device, whereas the laptop is designed to detach if you trip on the wire.) The iPhone 17 already has the phone version of MagSafe, and the iPhone 18 will too, but that doesn’t mean it will have the Mac version as well. If nothing else, it would be enormously confusing.
Whereas the iPhone 17e is expected to be here in time for Apple’s “experience” on March 4, the first 18-series iPhones won’t arrive until September. And the actual iPhone 18, the cheaper baseline model, might not turn up until the following spring.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/c1x-modem-faces-first-failure/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[A reported hardware failure affecting Apple's new in-house C1X 5G modem in the iPhone Air has surfaced online, marking the first known real-world incident involving the company's own baseband technology. The ‌iPhone Air‌ is the first iPhone model to ship with the Apple's internally designed C1X 5G modem, replacing Qualcomm's X75 modem used across the iPhone 16 lineup. The transition to Apple-designed modems follows years of development after Apple acquired Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019 and began building its own baseband engineering teams and intellectual property portfolio with the goal of reducing reliance on Qualcomm and increasing efficiency. support thread on Reddit spotted by Wccftech, where the user "itstheskylion" described waking up to find the device had completely lost cellular reception. According to the user, the phone displayed no signal bars and diagnostics indicated a hardware-level cellular problem. The device had reportedly been kept in a case since purchase and showed no signs of physical damage. The user said that multiple troubleshooting steps were attempted, including restarting the device, performing a soft reset, and resetting network settings, but none restored cellular connectivity. The user also reported using a dual-SIM configuration with two different carriers, with neither connection functioning, which suggests the issue was not related to a carrier outage or network-specific disruption. Baseband hardware failures are uncommon in modern smartphones due to extensive factory testing and validation processes, but large-scale production inevitably includes a small percentage of defective units. Apple has historically replaced and collected devices that exhibit unusual behavior for internal analysis, particularly when new technologies are involved. At present, there is no evidence that the issue is widespread or indicative of a broader reliability concern. iPhone 18 Pro, ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max, and foldable ‌iPhone‌ are rumored to feature Apple's next-generation C2 modem.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/2881175/iphone-17e-release-date-specs-features-price.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple launched a new series of iPhones at the end of 2025: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, as well as a brand new iPhone Air, but there was no new iPhone 17e for those hoping for an update to the budget iPhone.
This wasn’t a surprise: Apple released the iPhone 16e in February 2025 to replace the iPhone SE, so an update to the iPhone “e” series phones wasn’t expected to arrive until early 2026.
If you’re considering buying an iPhone 17e, this is the place to keep up to date on its development. We’ll keep track of the latest reports and provide our analysis to help you decide if the iPhone 17e is the right phone for you.
What’s new since the last update to this article: It’s a year since the iPhone 16e launch on February 19 2025, will the iPhone 17e arrive today? Probably not, but it’s likely to arrive before, or on, March 4. At a glance: iPhone 17e vs iPhone 16e Specification / FeatureiPhone 16eiPhone 17e Launch / ReleaseFebruary 2025March 4 (Possible)

March 4 launch – possible The iPhone 16e arrived on February 19, 2025, so there was some hope that Apple could introduce its replacement on February 19 a year later… With that date now here it’s looking unlikely. However, there is an “Apple Special Experience” coming up on March 4, 2026, with media being invited to meet Apple execs in at least three global locations. It’s generally thought these meetings will tie to new Apple product launches. There are a number of other new product launches expected including a refreshed iPad Air, new entry-level iPad, M5 MacBook Air, M5 Pro/MaxMacBook Pro, and a brand new low cost MacBook.
An event on March 4 – even if Apple isn’t referring to it as an event – is good timing for Apple to launch the new iPhone 17e because it is right in the middle of the Mobile World Congress. According to various reports, the iPhone 17e has entered test production runs to prepare it for a spring 2026 release.
A rumor in early January said the iPhone 17e will go into production following CES (which ended January 9). This is unsurprising, as it follows the same pattern as the iPhone 16e. iPhone 17e: Specs: What’s new for the iPhone 17e
A19 with one fewer GPU than iPhone 17 – likely
MagSafe support – likely
C1X modem – possible
256GB SSD – possible
Apple’s decision to introduce the iPhone 16e in February 2025 represented a significant shift in its product strategy, moving away from the sporadic release cycle of the iPhone SE toward a more predictable, annual “e-series” lineup. This transition was driven by several strategic imperatives, ranging from the necessity of supporting new AI technologies to the desire to test in-house hardware components in a lower-risk environment. To maintain a starting price of $599 while including the high-end A18 chip, Apple made several calculated omissions that differentiate the 16e from the standard iPhone 16. The iPhone 17e is expected to address some of the shortcomings of the iPhone 16e with a few key design refinements (a Dynamic Island is rumored), more storage at the entry-level, MagSafe support and an updated processor (the A19).
Processor: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and others have reported that the iPhone 17e will have an A19 chip, which is no real surprise. If this is the case, it may be a slightly less powerful than the A19 chip used by the iPhone 17. Apple uses binned chips in the “e” series, so Tte A18 in the iPhone 16e has one fewer GPU core than the A18 in the standard iPhone 16; and the A19 in the iPhone 17e will likely have one fewer GPU core than the iPhone 17.
MagSafe: A December 2025 report in The Information claimed that Apple will add MagSafe support to the iPhone 17e, one of the features that is notably missing from the 16e. When we reviewed the 16e, the lack of MagSafe was one of its major shortcomings. A Macworld source in February 2026 claimed that the iPhone 17e will feature 25W MagSafe wireless charging.
Modem: Apple’s C1 modem first appeared in the iPhone 16e, and rumors suggest the iPhone 17e will use the same modem. However, it could take the newer C1X modem as found in the iPhone 17 series, which is apparently two times faster than the C1 while using 30% less energy.
Storage: There are suggestions that the iPhone 17e could follow the iPhone 17 with 256GB at the starting point, up from 128GB. However, in February 2026 Apple leaker, John Prosser said he expects the baseline storage to stay at 128GB. iPhone 17e: How the iPhone 17e display will be different
Dynamic Island instead of notch – possible Notch vs Dynamic Island.
David Price / Foundry Screen size: The iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch screen, which is larger than that of the iPhone 16 (6.1-inch). The iPhone 17e is not expected to get a bigger screen. It will likely sport a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate, the same as the iPhone 16e. Dynamic Island: Digital Chat Station reported in August 2025 that the display will have a Dynamic Island – a change from the notch on the iPhone 16e.
OLED: In December 2025, Korean website, The Elec reported that BOE will provide OLED displays to Apple for the iPhone 17e. BOE also provided OLEDs for the iPhone 16e. Samsung Display and LG Display are expected to also provide 17e displays. Bezels: The display, according to The Elec, will have thinner bezels than the 16e. iPhone 17e: Cameras
18MP front camera with square sensor – likely
The iPhone 17e will likely continue to have a single 48MP camera on the back but the 12MP camera on the front (as seen on the iPhone 16e) could get an update in line with the iPhone 17 series). The front-facing cameras across the iPhone 17 range have all been updated to 18MP, so it is possible that the iPhone 17e will see the same update to the selfie camera. If so, it will also include a square sensor capable of taking photos in any orientation without requiring the user to rotate the phone. The notch may be replaced by the Dynamic Island in the iPhone 17e. Foundry | Alex Walker-Todd iPhone 17e: Design &amp; Colors
Digital Island likely to be only visible external change
Colors: There have been no reports relating to the iPhone 17e’s colors. The iPhone 16e is available in black or white, and we expect the same for the iPhone 17e.
Design: No changes are expected for the design, although, as mentioned above, the new iPhone 17e could have a Digital Island instead of the notch at the top of the screen. There is a possibility that the there could be thinner bezels than the 16e, according to The Elec. iPhone 17e: Price
Starting at $599
A January 2026 report on Wccftech suggests that Apple has been able to reduce costs for the new iPhone 17e, so that the price won’t increase. This is thanks to lower costs for the OLED panels Apple is using. The iPhone 16e starts at $599/£599, and Apple is expected to price the iPhone 17e at $599 as well, though no reports have been made so far. Tariffs and production cost increases may affect the price, but since the “e” series is considered Apple’s lowest-priced iPhone, the price would not exceed that of the iPhone 17, which starts at $799, and the iPhone 16, whose price has been reduced to start at $699.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Meta is set to release its first smartwatch this year featuring health-tracking and built-in Meta AI, reports The Information. The smartwatch, which would compete directly with Apple Watch and other brands, is the result of a revived project that Meta canceled in 2022 amid broader spending cuts at its Reality Labs hardware division. The original project involved plans to release three different camera-equipped watch models, but it doesn't sound like they will be part of the company's future product lineup. The new watch is code-named "Malibu 2." include facial recognition – and it sounds like they will almost definitely appear before a pair of mixed reality glasses that the company has also been developing. Internally code-named "Phoenix," the MR glasses are said to have been delayed until 2027. Meta executives are said to have grown concerned that launching too many devices in quick succession could confuse customers, hence the delay. Last year, the Facebook parent company launched its Ray-Ban Display AR glasses, which apparently proved so popular that Meta had to delay an international rollout. Those glasses use a neural wristband for its gestural interface, so it's possible the new smartwatch could potentially take over those controls. Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is developing rival smart glasses, an AI pin, and AirPods with cameras, all of which will connect to the iPhone and will interface with the smarter version of Siri that's in the works.

      <title><![CDATA[ChatGPT is your iPhone’s secret superpower]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3026151/chatgpt-is-your-iphones-secret-superpower.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld AI is rapidly being integrated into the hardware and services we depend on, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. While Apple’s in-house AI models remain relatively limited for now, Apple users have other options: most appealingly, the company has natively baked OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT into its systems. This enables you to easily fetch up-to-date information, polish text, generate images, and much more.
If you’re not already using AI to accelerate your everyday workflows, it’s time to get with the program. Try these 10 ChatGPT features on your Apple devices of choice, and watch your productivity skyrocket.
Applets
OpenAI recently launched ChatGPT apps as a way to access your favorite services using text prompts. The feature is available in the latest ChatGPT app across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and the web. To get started, you can visit the Apps section in ChatGPT settings and connect the accounts you’re interested in.
For example, the Apple Music applet lets you find songs, generate playlists, and add them to your library right from ChatGPT. Similarly, the Adobe Acrobat offering enables you to upload a PDF document and make certain tweaks using the chatbot’s interface.
As you’d probably expect, the functionality of these apps is somewhat limited. They’re cut-down versions of the full app, a little like Apple’s App Clips, and more advanced workflows will still require the use of the real thing. But they’re solid for performing specific, quick tasks using natural language. There wasn’t much AI in the 90s, but we made up for it with our indie music. Mahmoud Itani / Foundry macOS assistance
ChatGPT’s integration with apps isn’t confined to the limited range of applets available on the platform itself. If you’ve installed the official client on your Mac, you’ll be able to link it to active macOS app sessions and ask relevant questions.
Simply tap on the App Store icon in the ChatGPT app’s text box to view a list of compatible, installed apps. If you pick Terminal, for instance, it will read the commands you’re entering and help you type the correct ones to achieve a certain aim. Likewise, it can view the notes you’re typing and suggest edits based on your prompt.
Quick access
Locate the ChatGPT app on your Home Screen can be inefficient when performing time-sensitive tasks. Fortunately, ChatGPT offers a ton of shortcuts to quickly summon it on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
On iOS and iPadOS, you can add ChatGPT controls to the Control Center and Lock Screen, letting you quickly initiate a new session from different parts of the system; on newer iPhones, you can also have the Action button launch a ChatGPT instance. On the Mac, you can hit Option and Space to reveal a miniature ChatGPT text box to enter your prompts, connect apps, upload files, and so on. You can also add ChatGPT to shortcuts you create in the Apple Shortcuts app and have it analyze input or fetch requested data.
Siri fallback
Siri often fails to answer basic questions and instead redirects users to web results. If you’ve enabled Apple Intelligence, however, the voice assistant can now tap into ChatGPT’s intellect instead. To turn this on, open the Settings app, go to Apple Intelligence and Siri &gt; ChatGPT, and enable the Use ChatGPT toggle. (You can also turn off the Confirm Requests option if you’d rather not have Siri ask for your permission every time it needs to share a text prompt with ChatGPT’s servers.) Now, you can command Siri to ask ChatGPT any question, and it’ll read aloud the response it receives.
Writing Tools
This neat text editing suite allows you to natively proofread, rewrite, summarize, and change the tone of selected text. Thanks to ChatGPT, the feature also lets you apply custom edits or generate text from scratch. Just select the text you’d like to edit, then hit Writing Tools, followed by Compose. You can then describe the changes you’d like to make and ChatGPT will handle the rest. ChatGPT offers a range of preset styles when generating images.
Mahmoud Itani / Foundry Image Playground
Image Playground is Apple’s own AI image generator, featuring multiple illustration styles, doodle polishing support, offline access, and more. To elevate the quality of outputted images, you can rely on ChatGPT’s superior image generation models without leaving the app. Click the Styles dropdown menu in the Playground app on iOS, iPadOS, or macOS, then select ChatGPT. You can then pick a more specific style, such as Anime, Vector, or Oil Painting. Now you can type your prompt or add some of the suggested ones and wait for the result to appear.
Paid perks and data sync
Using ChatGPT integration on your Apple devices comes with daily limits that, when exceeded, prevent you from uploading files, generating images, and accessing advanced models. If you’re subscribed to ChatGPT Go, Plus, or Pro, you can link your paid account to extend or remove said limits. In Settings, go to Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri &gt; ChatGPT, and sign in with your OpenAI account. This will also sync the conversations you have with ChatGPT via Siri and show them in your chat history.
Group chats
Lastly, if you’re planning an event or working on a project with others, you can create a group chat in the ChatGPT app. To get started, tap on the dedicated button in the top-right corner of a ChatGPT conversation and share the link with your friends or coworkers. This lets you all brainstorm together and have ChatGPT share its knowledge whenever needed. ChatGPT can contribute to group chats.
Mahmoud Itani / Foundry Shopping advice
Picking the right model when upgrading your Apple device can be confusing for tech newbies. Obviously, Macworld should be your first stop when seeking iPhone, iPad, or Mac buying advice, but ChatGPT is keen to join the party with its Shopping Research feature.
Select the relevant mode in the ChatGPT app and describe the product you’re looking to buy. ChatGPT will ask follow-up questions related to budget and performance expectations to narrow down your options, then display results comparing the prices, specs, images, and other relevant aspects of the matching devices. You can then choose one of them and buy it through your favorite online retailer.
Understanding your iDevices
ChatGPT can also help tech newbies learn more about their Apple devices and the latest OS features. Again, Macworld has long been happy to help in this regard, but who are we to stand in the way of progress? It’s far better, clearly, to ask a chatbot.
ChatGPT can, for example, check the latest available OS version for your device and briefly list the top features it introduces using simple language. This helps you familiarize yourself with what’s new, without having to read complex changelogs. Similarly, if you encounter errors when using your Apple devices, you can upload screenshots to ChatGPT or use the video calling mode to show it what’s going on in real time. The chatbot will then suggest solutions or workarounds based on similar issues discussed on online forums. Or beloved Apple-focused websites.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3023806/the-mac-youve-always-wanted-is-coming-soon.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld According to rumors, 2026 is shaping up to be a huge year for the Mac, starting in just a couple of weeks with Apple’s first event (or “experience”) of the year. Along with the usual faster chips, Apple reportedly has new tricks up its sleeve in 2026, with several new features that will have Mac users everywhere saying, “Finally!” Here are four major overdue announcements we expect to arrive this year.
A budget MacBook
iPhone fans have long pined for a truly affordable MacBook priced below the $999 MacBook Air that isn’t just an older model with a cut-rate price. That dream machine may finally arrive in just two short weeks. On March 4, Apple will hold a series of “experiences” in New York, London, and Shanghai, and the star is expected to be the first-ever low-cost MacBook. After tackling the mid-range market with the MacBook Air, Apple reportedly wants to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops, with a new laptop that could be as cheap as $599. Apple will reportedly use an A18 Pro or A19 Pro iPhone chip, and it will likely have a smaller screen than the Air and possibly fewer USB ports. But it will be powerful enough for everyday tasks and light work. For a lot of users, that’s all that’s needed.
MacBooks with OLED displays]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld When they already have the best phone on the planet, what do you buy an iPhone user? We’re here to help you select the best iPhone gifts available—perfect gifts for Christmas, birthdays, Fathers Day, Mothers Day, anniversaries, and when you are just feeling generous.
If not a brand new iPhone (check out our iPhone Buying Guide if your budget stretches that far), then how about one of the many available iPhone accessories? Throughout the year we have tested and reviewed the best iPhone accessories from Apple and trusted companies, and we can recommend the best ones for the people on your list. We’d be delighted to receive any of these iPhone accessories as a gift.
If you want to splash out on another Apple product, take a look at our guides for best Apple Watch, best iPad and best Mac.

Here we recommend some of our favorite iPhone cases, power banks, chargers, cables and tech organizers, plus a roundup of some super stocking stuffers for the iPhone user in your thoughts.
iPhone Gift Guide: Cases
If your loved one doesn’t own a case for their iPhone then this may be the best gift you can get them as it will share a bit of personality while protecting their precious phone from knocks, drops, and everyday scrapes. If they already have a case, then buy them a new or better one. Just slipping on a new case can transform an old iPhone into something that feels brand new again. It’s even more satisfying than an iOS update!
We have tested the best cases for the iPhone 17 family, best cases for iPhone 16 and best cases for iPhone 15 and most of these are available for older models from the iPhone 11 up. Run through those lists to see the widest range of cases you can select as a gift, and get one for yourself while you’re at it.

With the Arc Pulse you can add a rigid aluminum shell that protects the edges and corners with an internal shock-dampening structure in a minimalist sculptural design that is precision-fit for your iPhone (iPhone 13 and later).

iPhone Gift Guide: iPhone power banks
Hands up if your iPhone has never run out of juice during the day when you are far from a convenient power socket. Yeah, right.
Apple used to make a special Smart Battery Case for the iPhone but stopped selling these when it added MagSafe magnetic wireless charging to the iPhone 12 and later. It then sold its own MagSafe Battery Case but stopped making these when it launched the iPhone 15. But fear not, as there are some great MagSafe power banks out there that clamp onto the back of your iPhone (12/13/14/15/16/17) and can recharge the phone for long enough that you can reach a power source.
Of course, Macworld has tested many of them and picked the best MagSafe power banks, but here are a few of our favorites. Pros
Huge 10000mAh battery capacity
Built-in USB-C cable
Wireless or 30W wired charging Retailer Price View Deal Product Price The Anker Zolo Magnetic Power Bank is available in four colors—black, blue, pink or white—and uses MagSafe to magnetically stick to the back of your iPhone when you need a power boost. In our tests, it recharged an iPhone twice over with its 10000mAh battery capacity. Better still, it features its own built-in USB-C cable for charging up the battery pack or wired-charging the iPhone 15/16/17 families that have a USB-C port rather than Lightning. Using the cable rather than MagSafe will charge an iPhone 15/16/17 at an impressive 30W. MagSafe wireless charging is slower at 7.5W but it will still rescue a fading iPhone 12 or later—or you can supply your own Lightning cable (or USB-C for iPhone 15 users) and connect with a wire. It also features a handy kickstand. Anker If you have an older (pre-15) iPhone, then you need a Lightning cable but the non-magnetic Anker Zolo Power Bank has both, meaning it will still be relevant when you upgrade to a USB-C iPhone. And of course you can use the USB-C cable to charge the power bank itself. If you have a family with both USB-C (15/16/17) and Lightning (14 and earlier) iPhones this will suit all models. There’s a handy digital battery-level display, too. This version of the Zolo doesn’t feature wireless charging. Anker With no built-in cable but a fast 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging pad, a third option is the Anker MagGo 10K Slim Power Bank (above), which is the slimmest 10K high-capacity wireless power bank we have tested—perfect for carrying with you in a bag for emergencies when your iPhone starts to fade and you are miles from a power socket or have forgotten your charger and cable. Pros
5000mAh battery capacity
Color options
15W wireless or 30W wired charging Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal Product Price This 5K battery pack was the winner for slimmer 5K magnetic power banks in our recharging tests, recharging a faded iPhone 16 Pro by 79%.
Belkin and Amazon offer a choice of colors (It’s available in a range of colors (White, Blue, Sand, Blue, Citrus Yellow, and Gold), and the Apple Store now has an exclusive set of new colors, including a brighter Pink, Deep Purple with a red stand and Teal with a yellow stand
The Belkin’s kickstand is easy to use and feels robust, and the battery pack itself is marginally smaller than the Ugreen. The $49.99 Torras MagStall Power Bank is a little slimmer but wider and boasts a stand/finger-grip, although recharges to a slightly lesser extent. Pros
Fastest 25W wireless or 30W wired charging
5000mAh battery capacity Retailer Price View Deal Product Price This 25W wireless power bank lived up to its claims of wirelessly charging an iPhone 16 Pro from 0% to 50% in 32 minutes—12 to 15 minutes faster than a 15W power bank. That might not sound a lot but when you’re in a rush to charge your phone, every minute counts. 25W wireless charging is limited to the iPhone 16 and 17 families, running at least iOS 26; older iPhones will charge at 15W using this power bank.
The Baseus PicoGo Magnetic 10K Power Bank (AM61) is an output blazer is more ways than one. It is certified Qi 2.2 so charges wirelessly at 25W. The built-in USB-C cable is rated at 45W, which is fast enough to keep even a MacBook going. Pros
Compact iPhone, Watch, AirPods charging stand
10K power bank
Foldable for travel Retailer Price OneAdaptr View Deal Product Price This compact OneGo power bank has it all: it can charge four devices at the same time—including iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods, plus another via its side USB-C port—and then folding up into a lightweight form that can slip into your pocket or overnight bag. iPhone Gift Guide: USB-C iPhone chargers
A simple charger sounds like a boring present but we think any iPhone users would be delighted to receive one of these beauties now that Apple no longer includes one in the box with new iPhones. And which iPhone users couldn’t do with at least one more spare charger at home or in the office—or a special one for travel?
An iPhone charger should be rated at least 20W, and we’d recommend 30W or better as newer iPhones can accept higher wattages than even Apple admits. A 30W charger can handle an iPad Pro and has just enough to power up even a 13-inch MacBook Air.
For more details and options, read our Best Picks roundup of the best iPhone chargers. Further down we recommend some multi-device chargers that might make more of an impact come unwrapping day. Pros
Cute robot-shaped charger
Two color options Retailer Price View Deal View Deal Ugreen View Deal View Deal Product Price The latest GaN (Gallium Nitride) chargers are tiny so we’re used them them being labeled “cute” but this small phone charger really is cute, shaped like a friendly robot. Take off its boots and you’ll find the plug prongs that connect straight into a wall power socket. The boots are even magnetic. Why? We don’t know but you can store the plug protector on most metal surfaces when the charger is in use. When plugged in, the LED screen shows different expressions that refer to the charging states. Its 30W power is enough to fast charge even the biggest iPhone. You’ll need a USB-C to USB-C cable to charge an iPhone 15/16/17 and USB-C to Lightning cable for older iPhones. It’s even powerful enough to keep a small MacBook charged. Pros
Smallest, lightest 30W charger
Foldable plug
Multiple color options Retailer Price View Deal View Deal Anker View Deal Product Price Measuring just 1.12 × 1.12 × 1.39 inches (U.S. model), the 30W Anker USB-C Nano Charger is the smallest 30W USB-C charger we’ve had in our labs for testing, and it weighs just 1.3oz (36g). The U.K. model is larger but also features foldable prongs and is equally incredibly light. It’s available in a range of pastel colors, including Misty Blue, Lilac Purple, Phantom Black, Aurora White, and Natural Green. Pros
Small, light 45W charger
2 ports
Foldable plug Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal Ugreen View Deal Product Price This two-port wall charger from Ugreen is great if your household or office has two phones—one doesn’t even need to be an iPhone! Indeed you could charge your iPhone plus Apple Watch or AirPods, too. Each USB-C port is rated at 45W so one could charge a mid-sized laptop. Using both ports, one will give 25W and the other 20W—enough for a reasonably fast charge. It’s a great compact choice for homes with a couple of devices in need of a power boost. iPhone Gift Guide: MagSafe chargers
While charging using a USB-C cable (USB-C to Lightning for older iPhones, and USB-C to USB-C for the iPhone 15 and later) from your charger is the fastest way to charge an iPhone, more convenient is wireless charging. Since the iPhone 12, wireless charging has become more efficient and therefore faster with Apple’s MagSafe technology that magnetically clamps the iPhone more securely to the wireless charger.
You can buy a simple USB-C to MagSafe charging pad, like Apple’s $39/£39 MagSafe Charger or a third-party alternative, or a multi-device charger that includes a MagSafe charger for iPhone plus a charger for AirPods or Apple Watch. For more details and options, read our Best Picks roundup of the best MagSafe wireless chargers. Pros
3-in-1 charging
Fast 15W for iPhone
Folds for travel Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal Satechi View Deal Product Price We love that once static MagSafe chargers are now folding up into highly portable devices, and that’s certainly true of the Satechi 3-in-1 Foldable Charging Stand. It uses Qi2 magnetic wireless charging tech so can power an attached iPhone at 15W. The 5W Apple Watch Charger is all set for Watch fast charging, and you can place your AirPods case at he front for three-at-a-time charging. Pros
3-in-1 charging
Fastest 25W for iPhone Retailer Price View Deal View Deal Belkin View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal Product Price 2025 saw the release of a new wireless charging technology called Qi 2.2, which allows for super-fast 25W speeds, which is nearly as fast as you’ll get with a less convenient charging cable. 25W works only for the iPhone 16 or 17, with older iPhones stuck at 15W, but this is a great gift for owners of the latest iPhones if they also own an Apple Watch and AirPods. Pros
Charges iPhone and AirPods
Adjustable charging pad Retailer Price Check Product Price This is a great budget option for a stand that will charge both your iPhone and AirPods. At 7.5W, Anker’s stand is not as fast at charging as the 15W or 25W models reviewed above, but it will be fast enough for most of us. If speed is your only priority, charge using a cable! Like those pricier charger options, this charger features an adjustable charging pad, so can be angled to your own requirements. Pros
Charges Watch and iPhone (swap Watch for AirPods)
15W Qi2 for iPhone
Compact and portable Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal Twelve South View Deal Product Price The ButterFly charger from Twelve South is a beautiful piece of design and works exactly as it should. You can charge your iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time, or switch the iPhone for your AirPods case if that is your greater need. It’s a great travel charging companion that easily slips into a pocket. There’s the original metal MagSafe ButterFly model or the more affordable ButterFly SE that uses Qi2 but matches MagSafe for 15W iPhone charging speed. The ButterFly comes in five different color options, two exclusive to Twelve South. Pros
Charges Watch and iPhone (swap Watch for AirPods)

A protective case is a must for your iPhone but what about all the other Apple gear, power banks and gadgetry stuff that needs to come with it? Pros
Dedicated iPhone pocket
Oozes style and practicality Retailer Price Waterfield View Deal Product Price Handcrafted from full-grain leather in San Francisco this refined super-premium crossbody bag from Waterfield features a dedicated iPhone pocket, which you can access one-handed via the clever magnetic closure that eliminates the need for fumbling with zippers. An extra layer of protection, the self-finding magnetic Fidlock buckle secures the flap in place. There’s also a more open slip pocket at the back.
This bag will just as well suit the style-conscious iPhone user who doesn’t want to stuff their device in their back pocket. There’s plenty of space inside (3.5L) the 10-x-7-x-3-inch bag for more than just your phone, with another zipped pocket for your less-often required essentials. The black leather model of the Hudson is the most dressy of this beautiful bag, with the Chocolate and Grizzly colorways a little more casual but still very smart. iPhone Gift Guide: iPhone stands
If you don’t need wireless charging with your iPhone stand, here are our favorite iPhone stands. Pros
Flexible iPhone stand
Folds away to tiny form Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal UAG View Deal Product Price The all-metal UAG Magnetic Ring, in a unique hexagonal shape, adds little bulk or weight to your iPhone and secures magnetically as its name suggests. The ring grip stand features a 360-degree rotation that you can use as a portrait or lanscape kickstand for hands-free viewing or stable selfies. It’s available in a wide of colors: Blue, Pink, Titanium, Black, Olive and, ahem, Nude. Pros
Flexible iPhone stand
Folds away to tiny form Retailer Price View Deal MOFT View Deal Product Price How often do you carry a tripod around with you in case you need to take a group shot or selfie from a distance further than your arm? Or you simply want to flip your phone into a more comfortable viewing position? Inspired by origami, the Moft Snap Wallet Tripod could be several solutions you are looking for. It folds up into a credit-card-sized device that’s just 0.36 inches thick and weighs 4.7oz, so you hardly notice in your pocket even though unfolded it can raise your iPhone by up to 8 inches. It’s clever and you’ll be surprised just how useful it can be. It uses Apple’s MagSafe tech to firmly grasp the iPhone, and then it’s up to you to decide which of the three shapes—floating, stand or vlogging—you want to fold it into. Plus you can store two credit or travel cards in it even when it’s connected to you phone. Pros
360° iPhone stand
Dual-sided magnetic design
Includes finger-friendly grip Retailer Price View Deal Aulumu View Deal Product Price Aulumu calls its lightweight (34g) G09 Infinite Rotation Dual-Mag Stand “the first true 3-axis smartphone stand”. The aluminium alloy stand/grip features precision damping and its dual-sided magnetic attachment means it will securely clamp not just to your iPhone but any magnet-friendly surface on the other side. It can works as a desktop mount, kitchen aid, travel companion, or vlogging accessory. The inner white silicone ring even glows in the dark, and you don’t need to remove the stand when wirelessly charging your phone. Pros
Multiple angles
Foldable Retailer Price View Deal Product Price You could you this nifty stand for anything—video watching, gaming, travel and video calls to name a few activities enhanced by a phone stand—but Apple would like you to take it with your yoga mat to ensure you are hands-free when exercising to its Fitness+ service. The GoStand is built with a composite and silicone construction and steel hinge and features precision indexable back support adjusts with a low-profile button. Pros
Works like AirTag
5-card wallet and stand Retailer Price Journey View Deal Product Price Clamping magnetically to the back of your iPhone, this tri-function wallet stand is good looking and helpful if you misplace your phone. Not only will it hold up to five standard-sized cards but it pulls out to create a versatile stand in either landscape or portrait orientations. On top of that the built-in location tracker works perfectly with Apple’s Find My app so you can track it and make it findable if you’ve mislaid it. It makes a lovely gift for an iPhone users who no longer carries a wallet but still needs a few cards to hand. iPhone Gift Guide: Lightning and USB-C cables
If you thought that chargers might be a boring gift, I hope we’ve persuaded you otherwise. But how would you feel unwrapping a charging cable? Me? I’d be delighted as you can’t own enough charging cables, can you? They are always handy. Sure, it’s not a pony or a new TV but it’s easier to wrap.
Older iPhones will need a USB-C to Lightning cable; check out our roundup of the best Lightning cables. Pair one of these with a USB-C charger, see above, for the fastest charging. An older USB-A to Lightning cable doesn’t support iPhone fast charging.
The iPhone 15, 16 and 17 families now have a USB-C rather than Lightning port so you can use the same cable as you have for your MacBook. We have tested the best USB-C cables for iPhones and can recommend these as great little gifts. Pros
Color options
Robust braided design with rounded head Retailer Price Casetify View Deal View Deal Product Price No wrapping paper is going to look as good as this gift when unwrapped. It’s cute, it’s tough, and it is available in a range of super colors. The PowerThru by Casetify can charge up to 60W, which is more than enough for iPhone charging so could also be used for your USB-C iPad or MacBook. Pros
Tidily retractable
Takes up little space
No knots Retailer Price View Deal Baseus View Deal Product Price Cables are by definition awkward things to carry around. They get tied up in knots all by themselves, are a unsightly nuisance, and are tricky to store. This thin 3.3-foot (1m) or 5.5ft (2m) USB-C cable is retractable so will slip into a drawer or pocket without dangling around getting in the way. You can buy it in black, white, purple or blue and is rated to support 100W so it can be used to charge your MacBook, too.]]></description>

The work by Apple to bring Siri up to speed with other AI systems usable on a smartphone is gradually accelerating. While immediate attempts to bring a new more contextual Siri to fruition isn't quite ready for primetime, Apple is still looking to the future for other updates it can do to its assistant and Apple Intelligence.
It seems that the path ahead is to focus on its strength: local processing of queries. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

If you worked in IT during the 2000s and the early 2010s, you know that printer driver management was the absolute worst part of the job and was a huge part of OS X upgrades. Manufacturers delayed support for the new OS X for months, and it was generally just an absolute nightmare. Then the iPhone and iPad arrived and changed everything… slowly.

      <description><![CDATA[I have tested dozens of smart locks over the years for HomeKit Weekly, from the August lock to the latest Level Lock Pro. They all solved the problem of having to fish your keys out, but they never quite solved the problem of “my hands are full.” Even with Home Key, you’d still have to either get your Apple Watch to your lock or pull out your iPhone. Yes, plenty of locks offer various flavors of auto-unlock, but none are perfect and work 100% of the time. That is the problem Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology aims to solve. This week, I am taking a deep look at the Aqara UWB Smart Lock U400.

The post didn't elaborate on why Apple decided against using the more colorful hues for the M2 MacBook Air. But they did add that Apple's new color range "looks fresh." Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Earlier this week, Apple surprised users with the first iOS 26.4 beta for the iPhone. Many were disappointed (including me) when the update didn’t include the much-anticipated improvements to the estranged Siri assistant. However, this was nowhere near a featureless update. iOS 26.4 beta 1 introduced at least forty new features and changes, including notable upgrades to RCS and Stolen Device Protection.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066403/macos-26-3-might-have-just-confirmed-apples-biggest-march-4-surprises.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld As we have extensively covered, Apple is rumored to soon introduce new products, as the company recently confirmed a special announcement for March 4. Among the expected products are a low-cost MacBook and a new generation of Studio Display.
If you needed more evidence that these products will soon be arriving in stores, here’s proof from Apple itself. Code from macOS 26.3, released last week to the public, confirms the existence of such devices.
As discovered by Macworld, the final build of macOS 26.3 released to the public on February 11 includes kernel extensions (kexts) for three new devices identified as J700, J427, and J527. The codenames match previous reports, including those based on an internal build of iOS 26 leaked last year.
Low-cost MacBook essentially confirmed
J700 is the codename for the rumored new low-cost MacBook. This Mac is expected to be priced lower than the current MacBook Air, and will be the first Apple silicon Mac to be powered by an A-series chip instead of an M-series one.
More specifically, the new entry-level MacBook will reportedly have the same A18 Pro chip as the iPhone 16 Pro models. Benchmark tests show that the A18 Pro performs slightly better than the M1, which is good enough for most casual users who will be the target audience for this new laptop.
More recently, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the laptop will have a display that’s slightly under 13 inches and will be made of aluminum, despite its lower price. Some analysts believe it will cost as low as $599, but a price between $699 and $799 is more likely. Apple’s Studio Display is nearly four years old and in need of an update. Foundry Studio Display 2 may have an extra surprise
In addition to the highly anticipated MacBook, macOS 26.3 includes drivers for two other unreleased devices: J427 and J527, both variants of a new generation of Studio Display.]]></description>

Apple has confirmed that it will hold a special event on March 4, with rumors suggesting it could follow a week of announcements. A low-cost MacBook is expected to be the star of the show.
Now, references to codenames J427 and J527 have been found in the macOS 26.3 update. Those codenames match a report from September 2025 that pegged both products as being Apple Studio Displays. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The first GameSir G8 was an affordable return to iPhone grip controllers, and while its successor doesn't have any significant bells or whistles, it gains Apple certification and iPad mini support. GameSir G8 Plus review
Not every product needs to blow us away with some revolutionary new feature or concept. Game controllers have found a fairly mature place, design-wise, so there's no need to rock the boat.
The GameSir G8 Plus is an MFi-certified controller with a USB-C connector, rumble support, programmable buttons, and customization options. It closely resembles the GameSir G8 Galileo that it replaces, but it has some notable improvements. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After a default ruling against him for failing to respond, YouTuber Jon Prosser is now facing a jury trial and deposition over his iOS 26 leaks. YouTuber Jon Prosser is set to be deposed, as part of a lawsuit filed against him by Apple.
In July 2025, after revealing design details of what was then known as iOS 19, leaker Jon Prosser was sued by Apple for the alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. Things seemingly haven't gone well so far, even as he continues to post videos about Apple rumors.
Prosser has been served with document and deposition subpoenas. He'll have to provide sworn, out-of-court testimony so that Apple can determine the scope of the confidential information Prosser obtained and shared. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Malware can defeat iOS privacy indicators for recording
Camera and microphone indicators, which first appeared in iOS 14, are a big part of Apple's privacy message. Users depend on them to know when recording is going on.
Security researchers at Jamf found that Predator spyware can prevent those iOS recording indicators from appearing. It's not a standalone attack though — the technique is post-compromise behavior, and the analysis doesn't describe a new iOS vulnerability or a flaw that needs patching.

In a new video, YouTuber Linzin took viewers on a 22-minute journey through Huaqiangbei, China's famous electronics market. There, technicians worked their magic by laser-stripping the rear glass of an iPhone Air for a see-through effect.
They didn't stop there and milled space for a SIM slot directly into the frame. They also handled delicate board-level microsoldering to make the eSIM-only iPhone Air work with a physical SIM card.
The modified phone powered on, connected to a carrier, and worked just fine. It did run hotter under load and lost its water resistance. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/apple-west-virginia-csam-lawsuit/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[West Virginia's Attorney General JB McCuskey today announced a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of knowingly allowing iCloud to be used to distribute and store child sexual abuse material (CSAM). McCuskey says that Apple has opted to "do nothing about it" for years. "Preserving the privacy of child predators is absolutely inexcusable. And more importantly, it violates West Virginia law. Since Apple has so far refused to police themselves and do the morally right thing, I am filing this lawsuit to demand Apple follow the law, report these images, and stop re-victimizing children by allowing these images to be stored and shared," Attorney General JB McCuskey said. According to the lawsuit [PDF], Apple has described itself as the "greatest platform for distributing child porn" internally, but it submits far fewer reports about CSAM than peers like Google and Meta. new child safety features, including a system that would detect known CSAM in images stored in iCloud Photos. After backlash from customers, digital rights groups, child safety advocates, and security researchers, Apple decided to abandon its plans for CSAM detection in ‌iCloud Photos‌. "Children can be protected without companies combing through personal data, and we will continue working with governments, child advocates, and other companies to help protect young people, preserve their right to privacy, and make the internet a safer place for children and for us all," Apple said when announcing that it would not implement the feature. later explained that creating a tool for scanning private ‌iCloud‌ data would "create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit." West Virginia's Attorney General says that Apple has shirked its responsibility to protect children under the guise of user privacy, and that Apple's decision not to deploy detection technology is a choice, not passive oversight. The lawsuit suggests that since Apple has end-to-end control over hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure, it is not able to claim to be an "unknowing, passive conduit of CSAM." The lawsuit is seeking punitive damages and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection measures. Tag: Apple Lawsuits

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone satellite capabilities can grow, but physics are remorseless. There's still a limit on how much satellite internet can do and how fast it can do it — unless Apple produces a case that it has been researching that doubles as a big antenna.
When Apple first launched Emergency SOS via Satellite with the iPhone 14 back in 2022, it was remarkable idea that since then has saved many lives. Apple has improved it since, and has plans for much more in future, but there is always an issue over establishing the satellite contact.
Users have to point their iPhone in the direction of a satellite orbiting the Earth, and then keep pointing at it as the satellite moves relative to the sender. One single low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite will cross from horizon to horizon in seven minutes, but line-of-site connection time is less than that in real life, and depends on buildings, trees, and terrain.
The iPhone software helps locate and track the satellite. The iPhone antenna still has a small surface area, and isn't that high-powered. Only so much data can reliably be sent before the satellite has moved away.
Now in a newly-revealed patent application originally filed in 2024, Apple has shown how it has been researching a way around this. "Electronic Device and Case with Satellite Communication Capabilities" details ways of using a case to act as an antenna for the iPhone.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3057914/10-free-iphone-features-to-block-spam-and-daily-distractions.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld The iPhone has become an all-in-one device for communication, entertainment, productivity, and more. Naturally, as we install more apps, the number of unwanted notifications keeps growing. Spam is no longer limited to occasional emails, texts, and calls; many apps now use push notifications to deliver ads, irrelevant recommendations, and other distracting alerts. Fortunately, iOS includes a comprehensive set of tools that help you reduce all sorts of spam types and focus on what actually matters.
1. Good ol’ blocking
Blocking remains one of the simplest, most straightforward ways to shut down a consistent source of noise. If the same phone number keeps texting or calling you, you can easily head to the info card in Messages or the Phone app’s call log and hit the Block button. All relevant third-party communication apps offer a blocking functionality as well.
Similarly, if an app you installed has been abusing the push notification system, you can tweak or revoke the permission. In the Notifications section of the Settings app, you can decide how an app gets to notify you, if at all. For example, you could turn off the Sounds toggle to receive silent alerts or uncheck the Lock Screen option to stop seeing banners when your iPhone is idle.
Before revoking an app’s notification permission, it’s wise to scan the settings in the app itself. Many apps let you opt out of certain notification categories. This enables you to still receive updates about the things you care about, and nothing else.
2. Limit mirroring
The Apple ecosystem lets iPhone users mirror calls to nearby iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches. That’s not to mention that, beyond calls, macOS and watchOS support third-party app notification mirroring, and AirPods can interrupt your music playback to announce incoming alerts. These integrations are welcome, but can make using our everyday devices overwhelming. Fortunately, you can choose what alerts get mirrored to other devices without completely blocking them on iOS.
In the Settings app, under Notifications, you can turn off (for individual or all apps) the Announce Notifications feature that reads out alerts when your AirPods are connected. Likewise, you can go to each app’s notification settings and disable the Show on Mac toggle to stop mirroring alerts to macOS. The Watch app offers a comparable section to manage the notifications iOS pushes to watchOS, too.
To prevent all of your devices from ringing every time someone calls you, you can head to the Phone app’s settings and turn off Calls on Other Devices.
3. AI notification handling
If you’re using a newer iPhone, the on-device AI can analyze the contents of your alerts and highlight the ones it deems important. Apple Intelligence can also summarize long or multiple texts to make grasping their content easier. To set these features up, go to the Prioritize Notifications and Summarize Notifications pages in the Settings app’s Notifications section. Foundry 4. Scheduled summaries
Scheduled Summary is yet another alert management tool that helps you avoid unnecessary distractions. When enabled in the Notifications settings page, the feature bundles unimportant alerts throughout the day and delivers them together at a time of your choosing. iOS will still notify you about time-sensitive updates, like calls and urgent notifications. Foundry 5. Focus modes
Focus is Apple’s advanced do-not-disturb system, letting you pick which apps and contacts can notify you across your devices. You can create multiple Focus modes with varying rules to match your different activities. The Focus mode dedicated to work, for example, would let alerts from your boss and collaborative apps through. You could also set in-app filters that hide content accordingly, like concealing non-work inboxes in the Mail app. To set it up, head to Focus in the Settings app. Foundry 6. Messaging controls
While blocking is effective for alerts coming from the same source, users often get spammed by random numbers. Luckily, the Messages app accommodates that, letting you silence all texts (or non-time-sensitive ones) from unknown numbers. It could also place them in a separate inbox to keep your main view clutter-free. Go to Messages settings, enable the Filter Spam and Screen Unknown Senders toggles, then customize how you want the feature to behave.
7. Call management
In Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Phone, you can enable similar filters for incoming calls. Under Screen Unknown Callers, you can choose if unsaved numbers are silenced or asked for the reason of calling automatically using on-device AI. The latter option will display a transcript in real time, so you can pick up and take over the call if it turns out to be relevant. Otherwise, enabling the Unknown Callers toggle under Call Filtering will move missed calls and voicemails from unsaved numbers to a separate list. Foundry 8. Third-party solutions
While call management tools have become reliable on iOS, you could still opt for third-party apps for added functionality. TrueCaller, for example, can warn you about known spam/scam numbers and look up the likely name of the person ringing you.
9. Mail filters
Like Messages and Phone, Apple’s Mail app offers automatic lists to help keep your inbox clean. You can enable the Categories toggle under the 3-dot menu in your inbox to reveal five main lists—Primary, Transactions, Updates, Promotions, and All Mail. The Mail app will scan every incoming email and place it in the respective list, reserving the Primary list for essential messages. Foundry 10. Calendars]]></description>

Apple withdrew its claims back in 2024, but an independent class-action lawsuit was still being pursued on behalf of iPhone owners. This lawsuit has now been abandoned …

Since 2020, the Car Key feature has allowed iPhone and Apple Watch owners to unlock and start their cars with the use of mobile devices. According to a social media post spotted on Monday, the 2026 Toyota Rav4 has gained support for Apple's Car Key system.

Wedbush took its Apple target price up to $350 in December 2025, based on high expectations for Apple Intelligence. Keeping that figure, it then repeated this expectation in January 2026 — and is now back to do so again, specifically because of recent rumors.
Those rumors claimed that testing of the new Siri is going poorly, and its improved features will be delayed, perhaps until iOS 27 in September. Consequently, investors have been selling off their Apple shares, but Wedbush says this is unwarranted. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Barely 24 hours after responding to his "reciprocal" tariffs being struck down and his retaliation of a 10% global tariff, President Donald Trump has upped the damage by making it 15%. Tim Cook [left], President Donald Trump [right]
On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that sweeping tariffs introduced by President Trump were done illegally. While Trump's retaliation was expected, it seems that he didn't believe he went far enough with his new tariff plan.
Trump introduced a new global import tariff of 10% under Section 122 on Friday, which follows rules including being a uniform rate instead of country-specific, and for a limited term of up to 150 days unless Congress extends the period. However, Section 122 did permit temporary tariffs of up to 15%, higher than the 10% rate set by the President. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld TL;DR: CleanMy Phone scans duplicates, compresses media, and organizes your camera roll so your iPhone feels new again — for just $19.99.
You know the warning: “iPhone Storage Full.” Suddenly, you’re speed-deleting photos from 2017, removing apps you still probably need, and debating whether one blurry brunch pic is worth iCloud rent.
Instead, there’s an affordable and easy solution.
CleanMy Phone (now $19.99, normally $44.99) acts like a spring cleaning crew for your camera roll. The app scans your device and intelligently finds duplicate photos, giant videos, forgotten screenshots, and low-quality shots you didn’t realize were multiplying.
The surprisingly helpful part? It doesn’t just delete — it suggests. AI highlights the best image in a group, compresses videos without wrecking quality, and can even convert Live Photos to standard shots to save serious space.
Everything runs locally on your device, so your photos never leave your phone. No uploading, no weird privacy tradeoffs — just a cleaner library.
It also shows real-time storage analytics, so you finally understand why 40GB vanished overnight (spoiler: videos and memes).
Instead of upgrading storage again, you might just clean it up.
Because most phones don’t need replacing — they need organizing.
Get CleanMy Phone for your iPhone or iPad while it’s just $19.99 (MSRP $44.99). CleanMyPhone Cleanup Storage AppSee Deal

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld TL;DR: Until February 22 at 11:59 p.m. PT, these MacBook Pros are only $430.
Now is a tough time to need a better computer. Tech prices are going up, but that doesn’t mean you can’t upgrade. This 2020 MacBook Pro is in near-mint condition, but it’s still only $429.97 (reg. $1,999) right now.
This 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 quad-core processor that runs at 2.0GHz, so everyday work like browsing, video calls, and document editing feels smooth. It has 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which is plenty of space for apps, photos, and big project files, and it helps the system stay responsive when you have a lot open at once.
The 13.3-inch Retina display runs at 2560×1600 resolution with True Tone, so text looks sharp, and colors are vivid while the screen adjusts to the lighting in your room. Intel Iris Plus graphics handle streaming, light creative work, and general use without drama. The backlit Magic Keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, and the Touch Bar and Touch ID give you quick shortcuts and fingerprint login.
You get four Thunderbolt 3 ports that handle charging, external displays, and fast storage through USB-C. Wireless connections use 802.11ac Wi Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 for modern routers and accessories.
This Grade A refurbished unit should arrive in near-mint condition, with only minor signs of use. It weighs about 3.1 pounds, comes with a charger, and includes a limited third-party warranty.

      <description><![CDATA[Ten months after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs that hurt US businesses and consumers, and hit Apple to the tune of $3.2 billion, the Supreme Court has ruled that it was done illegally. Refunds will be messy. Trump launching his tariffs in April 2205
Trump was always expected to introduce tariffs, but the extent of his April 2025 "Liberation Day" ones caught the world by surprise. The claimed mathematics behind the original rates was ridiculed, and then Trump further raised them to ostensibly punish countries, or even individuals like Tim Cook.
The Supreme Court has ruled 6 to 3 that imposing the tariffs without Congress's involvement was illegal. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the ruling, which denied Trump's claim that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) gave him the authority to act unilaterally.

      <description><![CDATA[Hours after the Supreme Court struck down broad "reciprocal" tariffs as unlawful, President Donald Trump lashed out at justices, and said he will impose a 10% global tariff under a different trade law with more restrictions and a timetable. President Trump introduces a global import tax. Image credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
The announcement follows a 6-3 ruling that the earlier tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, exceeded presidential authority and required congressional approval. The now-invalidated tariffs have cost Apple about $2 billion.
Section 122 provides a narrower legal pathway, but it doesn't soften the economic impact. The statute permits temporary tariffs of up to 15% total for 150 days unless Congress votes to extend them. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Listen, we love MacBooks around here, but we hate paying Apple’s storage upgrade prices. That’s why today’s deal is so good: B&amp;H Photo is selling the M5 MacBook Pro with 1TB of storage space for $1,599, the same price as the 512GB version. Now that’s a deal worth getting!
So, the 14-inch MacBook Pro M5 is an absolute beast of a laptop that we gave a 4.5-star rating to and our Editors’ Choice award. We loved the improved CPU and GPU performance, as well as how speedy the drive is. We concluded that “the M5 MacBook Pro offers a great combination of price and performance.” And with this deal, you’ll get twice the storage without paying a penny more
The model’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR Display delivers crisp visuals and vibrant colors, as well as an amazing 1,000 nits of brightness that will make it easy to use the laptop in any lighting situation. The laptop also features a slew of ports, including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, USB-C, and an SD card reader, as well as MagSafe for power.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Preview can do more than just show you a file in macOS, as it is especially handy for annotating images and editing PDFs. Here's everything you need to know about Preview in macOS 26 Tahoe. Preview in macOS 26 Tahoe
Preview is one of the long-standing apps on macOS, having been included with the operating system for decades. In 2025, Preview finally moved over to iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, with a version tailored for mobile devices.
It is also a severely underrated app, as it is chiefly used as a way to view images and PDFs on the Mac. It's a lightweight viewer that saves you from needing to open other heavier applications, like Photoshop or Adobe Acrobat. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

There is a split view icon in Chrome that can be clicked to enter the new view. With PDF annotations, the Chrome PDF Viewer can be used to highlight text, insert signatures, and add notes.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066031/get-5-2nd-gen-airtags-for-the-price-of-4-with-this-rare-costco-deal.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple has a new AirTag for sale, but you’re probably not rushing out to buy one since you can still get the old ones for cheaper. But this deal may change your mind: Costco is throwing in a free AirTag when you buy a 4-pack for $100, essentially giving you five new AirTags for the price of 4, a savings of $45 on the price of buying five AirTags individually. (Note: You don’t need to be a member to take advantage of this deal.)
Apple’s 2nd-gen of AirTags have the same size as the previous model, and they look virtually the same. However, they have a louder speaker, which will make them easier to find even if your keys somehow ended up between couch cushions. Apple also upgraded the Bluetooth chip inside the tracker, expanding the range at which items can be located.
Also new is the U2 Ultra Wideband chip, which will make it possible to more precisely locate lost items, something that will definitely be handy. We’ve already tested the new AirTag 2 and gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, finding it to be a simple and efficient Bluetooth tracker that’s also super easy to set up and fairly inexpensive.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A plagiarism investigation into Apple TV's "The Hunt" has ended after three months, and there is now a debut date for the thriller. "The Hunt" on Apple TV
The six-episode French-language drama was scheduled to launch on December 3, 2025. In late November, it disappeared from Apple's platform after reports surfaced that it may have been mislabeled as an original work.
Apple removed The Hunt from listings and promotional placements days before its premiere without public explanation. Subsequent reporting indicated the series bore significant similarities to Douglas Fairbairn's 1973 novel Shoot and the 1976 U.S.-Canadian film adaptation of the same name.]]></description>

McCuskey's office also cited a 2020 text message from a then-Apple anti-fraud lead as saying that Apple's decisions over the way it handles iCloud and the storing of images make it "the greatest platform for distributing child porn."
In a statement to Reuters, Attorney General JB McCuskey argued that Apple's inaction is "inexcusable." Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In perhaps the least surprising news of the decade, a leaked email confirms Ring had every intention of tracking people and not just pets with its doorbells. Jamie Siminoff, founder of Ring
Ring, a home security company known for its widely adopted video doorbells, bought a Super Bowl ad space. And, within 30 seconds, the company managed to kill off any remaining goodwill it had with the general public, forcing it to back off from a proposed partnership with Flock Safety.
The idea was pitched as harmless. You mark your dog missing, the other cameras in your neighborhood keep an eye out for your dog, and if found, you get an alert. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Back in 2021, Facebook had plans to make a smartwatch, and it was far enough along that there was even a leaked image of just how much it looked like an Apple Watch.
Nothing came of it back then, but maybe not for technological reasons. It was also in 2021 that the Facebook company was renamed Meta in a feeble attempt to distance itself from its own appalling record on privacy abuses. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

It seems the March 4 Apple Experience won't be an actual launch of new products in Apple's catalog, but instead capping off multiple announcements during the week. That gives Apple a lot of opportunity to promote multiple items.
With the breadth of rumored devices on the docket, including many anticipated for launch in early 2026. it certainly needs that opportunity. But, as ever, some have more chance of making an appearance than others. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In a court case concerning the mental health effects of social media, Mark Zuckerberg's defense includes that he tried to discuss the issue with Tim Cook, who, obviously, doesn't run a social media platform. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg
The trial concerns in part the issue of age verification, which Meta has previously tried to dodge by saying Apple and Google should deal with it rather than any application. The case is a specific one brought to a Los Angeles court by a 19-year-old who claims social media led her to self-harm and suicidal thoughts.
It's being seen, though, as a test case with much wider implications. The unnamed teenager and her mother originally sued Meta, YouTube, Snap and TikTok, although the latter two have settled out of court. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

A February 17 regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows Berkshire trimmed its Apple position during the quarter ended December 31, 2025. Apple was still valued at roughly $62 billion within Berkshire's portfolio at year's end.
The filing also shows Berkshire sold 77% of its Amazon stake in the same quarter, a far more substantial reduction than the modest adjustment to Apple. The latest stock cut by Berkshire isn't a harbinger of doom but rather a routine portfolio adjustment. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple may return to its marketing playbook, delivering multiple press releases of big products in just a few days, then highlight them all at the international March 4 "experiences." Apple's experience logo has many layers. The announcement of a special event on March 4 has led to wild speculation of what Apple could introduce at the time. However, with so many oddities surrounding it all, it may not be as straightforward as people think.
On Tuesday, Daring Fireball's John Gruber proposed that Apple's reference of it as an "experience" day is unusual. The choice of holding the event on a Wednesday is also unexpected, especially when you factor in Apple's preference for Tuesday product announcements.

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's failed social media platform Apple Music Connect is back, but this time not for fans. Instead, it's a set of promotion tools for record labels. Apple Music has added a new central resource for record industry professionals

      <description><![CDATA[Historically, Apple's March has been oddly busy in recent years, but as the company teases its newest "special Apple experience" happening on March 4, 2026, here's a look back at what we've seen before, and what we might see this time. Apple used to deck out conference halls for its launches —- this time for the iPad 3
That March 4, 2026 event is invitation-only one in New York, London, and Shanghai, and won't be streamed. It's being called an Apple Experience, too, which is the term the company used for the January 2026 event around the Apple Creator Studio .]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's next event is happening on March 4, it's not at Apple Park. In Apple's marketing world, location definitely matters. Apple Park, where most Apple events take place
Whenever Apple announces a new event and sends out invitations, the immediate thought is that it is for the launch of a new product. The rumor mill is then immediately scoured for potential items to launch at the event.
What many industry observers don't immediately consider is where the event is taking place. The problem is, that historically has bearing on what Apple is about to say.]]></description>

This morning, Apple sent out invitations to a “special Apple experience” on March 4 at 9am ET.
Apple generally holds product launches at 1pm ET at its headquarters in Cupertino, so this is definitely a unique event. So far, at least three events will take place in New York, London, and Shanghai, all coordinated to occur at the same time.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld At a certain point, disappointment gives way to fatalism. Last week, it emerged that Apple’s long-awaited Siri revamp has been delayed yet again, and my first reaction was to wonder if this even counted as news. Surely by now we’ve accepted that the new Siri is a phantasm, a trick of the light, a mythical creature like the Loch Ness Monster? Expecting it to actually launch would be as laughably naive as Charlie Brown expecting Lucy not to pull away the football at the last second.

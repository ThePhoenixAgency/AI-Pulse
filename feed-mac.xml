      <description><![CDATA[With iOS 26.4, CarPlay users will be able to use third-party chatbots with ‌CarPlay‌. AI services like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT will be accessible through the ‌CarPlay‌ system for the first time. Apple's ‌CarPlay‌ Developer Guide [PDF] lists voice-based conversational apps as a supported app type starting with iOS 26.4. Apple is implementing a new voice control screen that will let apps provide visual feedback for voice-based conversational apps. AI apps that integrate ‌CarPlay‌ will need to add support for the voice control screen while voice-based services are active. There is a specific entitlement for voice-based conversational apps, and companies that make chatbots will need to update their apps to add ‌CarPlay‌ support. Siri voice controls while in the vehicle. iPhone functions. There also won't be a wake word option to activate a third-party app, so users will still need to open the app to use the chatbot. After an app is launched, the customizable voice control screen will give users vehicle-optimized chatbot experiences. Related Roundups: iOS 26, iPadOS 26

      <title><![CDATA[iOS 26.4's New CarPlay Video Feature Shown in Action]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/ios-26-4-major-new-carplay-feature-revealed/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back at WWDC 2025, Apple revealed that it was planning to allow CarPlay users to watch video via AirPlay in their vehicles while they are not driving, and the first beta of iOS 26.4 suggests the feature may be nearing availability. There are several new references to CarPlay video streaming functionality within the iOS 26.4 beta's source code. The feature is not yet visible to users, but software developer Thomas Dye managed to get it working to some extent in Xcode's CarPlay simulator on the Mac, and he showed it off in a recent YouTube video (via 9to5Mac). On an iPhone connected to CarPlay, it appears that videos in any AirPlay-supported app can be played on the car's display. In the Dynamic Island, there is a button that allows you to show the video on the iPhone instead, when you want to. The demo also reveals that an Apple TV app will be available on CarPlay, allowing you to access shows and movies from the Apple TV streaming service and your own library. There is also a tab for accessing MLS Season Pass. However, it is not entirely clear if the Apple TV app will actually be this fully featured on the real version of CarPlay. The simulator provides an early albeit fairly clunky look at CarPlay's video streaming in action. The feature will likely be available by time iOS 26.4 is released to the general public in late March or early April, but there is a chance it will get held back until iOS 26.5 or later if Apple needs more time to wrap up development. indicates that automakers will need to implement support for the CarPlay video functionality, due to the safety requirement that the vehicle be parked, so it may take some time for the feature to widely roll out.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/iphone-17-pro-max-becomes-most-traded-in-phone/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[New trade-in data indicates that Apple's iPhone 17 Pro Max has rapidly become the single most traded-in smartphone. According to a new report from SellCell, Apple's latest flagship iPhone has quickly risen to the top of the independent trade-in market, accounting for 11.5% of all devices appearing in the top-20 trade-in rankings just months after release. The analysis is based on SellCell internal trade-in data and secondary market pricing trends gathered from 40 independent ‌iPhone‌ buyers. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max's share of the top-20 trade-in rankings increased from about 5.1% in late November to 11.5% by early February, more than doubling in approximately 12 weeks. 86% of traded-in units were categorized as being in mint or good condition, suggesting many owners are selling soon after purchase. iPhone 16 Pro Max and ‌iPhone‌ 13 sit at 7.2% of trade-ins each. The top-20 devices collectively represent around 47% of all trade-in activity. Trade-in rankings typically reflect a wide mix of devices at different points in their lifecycle, with older models often dominating resale volume due to large installed bases and the natural upgrade cycle. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max's rapid rise is therefore notable because the device only entered the market relatively recently yet has already become the most frequently traded-in model across the tracked channels. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max has apparently lost approximately 25.4% of its value since launch when measuring average resale prices for mint-condition devices over a 145-day period. Over an equivalent timeframe, the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max lost roughly 32.5% of its value. This represents more than 7% lower depreciation for the newer model and translates to as much as $95 in additional retained value compared with the previous generation over the same period.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/low-cost-macbook-expected-on-march-4/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple will announce its rumored low-cost MacBook at its event on March 4, with the device coming in a selection of bold color options, according to a known leaker. Earlier this week, Apple announced a "special Apple Experience" for the media in New York, London, and Shanghai, taking place on March 4, 2026 at 9:00am ET. Instant Digital" said that the color scheme of the Apple logo graphic used for the upcoming "Apple Experience" should match the colors of the new entry-level Mac. The invite graphic shows a 3D Apple logo made up of transparent discs in yellow, green, and blue. The post effectively constitutes a claim that the device is set to arrive at the event. In June 2025, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the more-affordable MacBook could come in silver, blue, pink, and yellow finishes, which would match the entry-level iPad. In his latest newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple has tested a range of playful color options for its upcoming low-cost MacBook, going well beyond the muted tones available on its current laptop lineup. Gurman said the colors tested so far include light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray, although he added that it is unlikely all of them will ship. The color palette would make the budget MacBook the most colorful laptop Apple has offered since the iBook G3 era in the late 90s, which included Tangerine, Blueberry, Indigo, Graphite, and Key Lime. iPhone chip, likely the A18 Pro, rather than an M-series processor. It will likely retail for well below $1,000.

      <title><![CDATA[10 Reasons to Wait for Apple's iPhone 18 Pro]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/reasons-to-wait-iphone-18-pro/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max. One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle this year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027. Overall Design iPhone 17 Pro Style Rumors suggest the iPhone 18 Pro lineup will largely retain the same design as the iPhone 17 Pro models. The rear camera system will look identical to the current generation, featuring a raised "plateau" with three lenses arranged in a triangle. Display sizes are also expected to remain unchanged, with the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max continuing to use 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch panels, respectively – the same dimensions introduced with the iPhone 16 Pro series. iPhone 18 Pro models could drop the current two-tone look of the rear casing found on the iPhone 17 Pro in favor of a more seamless aesthetic. For the next-generation models, Apple has apparently updated the back-glass "replacement process" to minimize the color difference between the Ceramic Shield 2 glass and the aluminum frame, resulting in a more unified appearance. Next-Level Battery Life Thicker Chassis The iPhone 18 Pro Max will feature a bigger battery for continued best-in-class battery life, claims a Chinese leaker. The Weibo user known as "Digital Chat Station" said that the ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max will have a battery capacity of 5,100 to 5,200 mAh. (The iPhone 17 Pro Max has the biggest ‌iPhone‌ battery to date at 5,088 mAh. Apple says it has a battery life of up to 39 hours.) According to another rumor, the body of the iPhone 18 Pro Max will be slightly thicker than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, raising the device's weight to around 243 grams. That would make the iPhone 18 Pro Max approximately 3 grams more than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is currently the heaviest model Apple has produced. A larger battery is the most likely cause. Smaller Dynamic Island Under-Screen Face ID? Rumors continue to circulate about whether the iPhone 18 Pro models will introduce under-display Face ID, but reports remain divided on when the technology will actually arrive. The feature would move the TrueDepth camera system beneath the display, eliminating the need for the current Dynamic Island cutout. Wayne Ma of The Information, Apple is targeting a design without a Dynamic Island, replacing it with a single pinhole camera in the upper-left corner of the screen. However, other sources dispute that claim. Display analyst Ross Young believes under-display Face ID is possible for the iPhone 18 Pro, but says a smaller Dynamic Island will still be present. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has echoed this view, reporting that the new models will feature a slimmed-down Dynamic Island rather than removing it entirely. Apple is also said to be testing new camera miniaturization technology to reduce the size of the front-facing camera currently located within the Dynamic Island. claimed the Dynamic Island cutout on the iPhone 18 Pro models will be approximately 35% narrower than it is on the iPhone 17 Pro models. Specifically, they said it will have a width of around 13.5mm, down from around 20.7mm Instant Digital has offered yet another version of events, saying the Dynamic Island will shrink in size, but that under-display Face ID and camera technology won't debut this year. Overall, the consensus suggests Apple may be refining the Dynamic Island before fully transitioning to an all-screen design in future generations. A20 Pro Chip 2nm Process The iPhone 18 Pro models will use Apple's A20 chip, based on TSMC's 2nm process for power and efficiency improvements. A move to 2nm fabrication increases transistor density, which will enable higher performance. The A20 series is expected to deliver roughly a 15 percent speed gain and about 30 percent better efficiency compared with the A19 series used in Apple's iPhone 17 models. Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) technology, suggesting at least some A20 chips will have RAM integrated directly onto the same wafer as the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, rather than sitting adjacent to the chip and connected via a silicon interposer. This could contribute to faster performance for both overall tasks and Apple Intelligence, and longer battery life from improved power efficiency. C2 Modem Replacing Qualcomm Apple plans to include its next-generation C2 modem in the iPhone 18 Pro models, according to supply chain analyst Jeff Pu. The chip will succeed the C1 modem, which debuted in the lower-cost iPhone 16e as Apple's first in-house cellular modem, and the C1X modem chip in the iPhone Air, which Apple says is up to 2× faster than the C1. The C2 is expected to bring faster speeds, improved power efficiency, and support for mmWave 5G in the United States – a feature missing from the C1 and C1X. Apple's modem roadmap is part of a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on Qualcomm, which currently supplies 5G modems for the rest of the iPhone lineup. The company has been working on developing its own cellular chips for years, aiming for deeper integration and greater control over power management and performance. New Camera Sensor Samsung-Made Samsung is working on a new three-layer stacked image sensor, reportedly intended for the iPhone 18. The sensor, referred to as PD-TR-Logic, integrates three layers of circuitry, which would improve camera responsiveness, reduce noise, and increase dynamic range. The leak comes from a source known as "Jukanlosreve," who claims the sensor is being developed specifically for Apple's 2026 iPhone lineup. Sony has long been Apple's sole image sensor supplier, so Samsung's entry would be a big shift in the iPhone's camera supply chain. Variable Aperture DSLR-Style Apple intends to equip this year's iPhone 18 Pro models with a variable aperture lens, according to reports. Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station claims the main rear camera – what Apple calls the 48-megapixel Fusion camera – on both iPhone 18 Pro models will offer variable aperture, which would be a first for the iPhone. A variable-aperture system physically adjusts the lens opening, letting more light in for low-light shots or narrowing the opening for brighter scenes and deeper depth of field. November 2024 that Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models will get the feature. 5G Satellite Internet Non-Terrestrial Data According to a report by The Information, Apple plans to add support for 5G networks that operate via satellites rather than Earth-based towers as early as next year. This advancement would allow future iPhones to gain full internet connectivity through satellite, not just limited emergency features. If Apple meets the 2026 target, the first devices to feature 5G satellite internet would likely be the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and the long-rumored foldable iPhone. Apple partners with Globalstar for its iPhone satellite features, but there is currently no service that delivers full 5G satellite internet directly to a smartphone, and the report did not specify who would supply it. Simplified Camera Control New Design Apple is reportedly working to simplify the Camera Control button's design on iPhone 18 models in order to reduce costs. The current Camera Control button on iPhone 17 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the force sensor recognizes different pressure levels for taps, presses, and swipes. remove the capacitive sensing layer and retain only pressure sensing recognition in the second iteration to achieve all Camera Control functions on the iPhone 18. The simplified version is not about reducing functionality in the button, but about saving money. The current solution is said to be very expensive for Apple and is generating costly after-sales repairs. New Colors Three in Testing Apple is rumored to be testing three new color options for the iPhone 18 Pro models: burgundy, brown, and purple. A burgundy finish would mark the first time the Pro and Pro Max models have been offered in any shade of red, apart from the lighter (PRODUCT)RED used on earlier devices. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were previously available in Deep Purple, and Apple has never released an iPhone in a genuinely brown color.

      <title><![CDATA[Rumor: Apple to Announce Multiple New Products in First Week of March]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-announcements-first-week-of-march/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple on Monday invited selected journalists and content creators to a "special Apple Experience" on Wednesday, March 4 in New York, London, and Shanghai. And now, rumors are surfacing about Apple's broader plans for that week. Daring Fireball's John Gruber today guessed that Apple will announce new products on a day-by-day basis from Monday, March 2 through Wednesday, March 4:
What strikes me is that March 4 — the "experience" day — is a Wednesday. So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the "experience" will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos.
In response to Gruber's post, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said product announcements on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of that week is indeed "exactly" what he is expecting, based on what he has heard from his sources. Gurman does not expect a typical Apple Event live stream for the new products, with the announcements likely to occur in the form of press releases on the Apple Newsroom website instead. However, there could still be a short video prepared for each new product, and the media would get hands-on time with the new products. Apple has announced new products on a Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday basis multiple times in the past, including in March 2019 (new iPad mini and iPad Air, iMac, and AirPods models) and in October 2024 (new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models). Lower-Cost MacBook: A18 Pro chip, 12.9-inch display, and fun color options. iPhone 17e: A spec-bumped successor to the iPhone 16e, with rumored upgrades including an A19 chip, MagSafe, and Apple's C1X and N1 wireless chips. The device will apparently have a notch despite earlier rumors mentioning a Dynamic Island, and pricing will continue to start at $599 in the United States. iPad Air: M3 chip → M4 chip. iPad: A16 chip → A18 chip or A19 chip. MacBook Air: M4 chip → M5 chip. MacBook Pro: M4 Pro and M4 Max chips → M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, and PCIe 5.0 support for faster SSD speeds. Mac Studio: M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips → M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips. Studio Display: 27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting, up to 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and either an A19 chip or A19 Pro chip. Home Hub: An all-new smart home hub featuring the more personalized version of Siri, a 6-inch to 7-inch square display, an A18 chip for Apple Intelligence, FaceTime, and more. Place it on a table or mount it on a wall. Security Camera: Apple-designed, HomeKit-enabled security camera accessory to be sold alongside the new smart home hub.
In addition, rumors about new Apple TV and HomePod mini models have been circulating for more than a year, but there is still no sign of them. In the end, we might only get three of these new products in the first week of March, with the most likely possibilities being the lower-cost MacBook with an iPhone chip, the iPhone 17e, and perhaps either an updated iPad Air or entry-level iPad. tested those three colors plus pink for the MacBook with an iPhone chip. MacRumors will be attending the "Apple Experience," so stay tuned for our coverage.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-beta-tidbits/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[There is a long list of new features in the iOS 26.4 beta, many of which we highlighted yesterday, but we've since discovered several other smaller changes that Apple made in the software. Health App iOS 26.4 includes a new Average Bedtime metric for the sleep section of the Health app, providing a better idea of how bedtime can impact sleep quality. iOS 26, there was a section for the blood oxygen level, but the graph did not include a blood oxygen measurement. Camera In the Settings section of the Camera app, there is a new "Audio Zoom" option. The feature causes recorded audio to focus on the subject when the camera is zoomed while recording a video. It can be turned on or off, depending on the audio settings you prefer. CarPlay We found mentions of Apple TV support for CarPlay, indicating that Apple will eventually allow users to watch Apple TV content through their car's dashboard when the vehicle is not in motion. would add support for AirPlaying video content to a CarPlay display, and it appears that feature could come in the near future. Apple Music A song can be added to multiple playlists at the same time in the Apple Music app. In the add to playlist interface, there is a list button, and tapping it allows you to select multiple playlists at the same time. Hotspot Data Apple moved the location of hotspot data usage. Rather than having data usage metrics tucked away under Cellular, you'll see how much data you've used right in the Personal Hotspot section. Live Captions Chinese (Taiwan) is a new language option for Live Captions in the Accessibility section. Passcode Settings In the Face ID and Passcode section of the Settings app, when you enter a passcode to access your options, the text is now center aligned instead of left aligned. Shortcuts Apple added a Set Charge Limit action to the Shortcuts app. It sets a battery charge limit for the iPhone. For more on all of the new features in iOS 26.4, we have a dedicated iOS 26.4 features guide.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/toyota-apple-wallet-car-keys/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In 2020, Apple added a digital car key feature to its Wallet app, allowing users to lock, unlock, and start a compatible vehicle with an iPhone or Apple Watch. The feature is currently offered by select automakers, such as Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Genesis, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo, and Toyota is now rolling out support as well. According to a Reddit post, select trims of the 2026 Toyota RAV4 support the Apple Wallet car key feature in the United States, at a minimum. We have yet to confirm if the feature is rolling out to any of Toyota's other 2026 model year vehicles. Toyota's implementation of the feature utilizes Ultra Wideband technology, allowing you to simply approach the vehicle, open the door, and start the vehicle, all with your iPhone in your pocket or your Apple Watch on your wrist. This passive entry functionality requires an iPhone 11 or newer* or an Apple Watch Series 6 or newer. MacRumors was first to report that Toyota was planning to offer Apple Wallet car keys, so this rollout was expected. It appears that the feature requires a Toyota Remote Connect subscription, which starts at $15 per month. A free one-year Remote Connect trial is included with the purchase of a new Toyota vehicle. list of vehicle models that support iPhone car keys, but it is updated infrequently, so it is currently missing some newer additions. * Excluding the iPhone SE 2, iPhone SE 3, and iPhone 16e.

Under a new Sleep Highlight, Apple lists the time that you went to bed and the time that you usually go to bed based on averages over a two-week period. In iOS 26.3, Apple displayed average sleep time over the past seven days. That highlight still exists, but it is now supplemented with the daily bedtime readout. iOS 26, there was a section for the blood oxygen level, but the graph did not include a blood oxygen measurement. Blood oxygen was available as a separate metric in the Vitals section, but it is now visible in the Vitals overview. The Vitals feature did not fully support blood oxygen because of Apple's ongoing legal dispute with Masimo. Masimo accused Apple of infringing on Masimo patents related to blood oxygen sensing, and it secured an import ban from the U.S. International Trade Commission. in early 2024 to be able to continue to sell the Apple Watch in the U.S., but Apple was able to re-add it in August 2025 with blood oxygen readouts available only on the iPhone. There is still no option to measure blood oxygen with the Apple Watch and see the results directly on the wrist in the U.S. Related Roundups: iOS 26, iPadOS 26

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/tvos-26-4-itunes-movies-tv-shows-removed/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[With tvOS 26.4, Apple has removed the dedicated iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Shows apps that listed content available for purchase. Buying movies and TV shows can be done through the Apple TV app instead. Apple started phasing out the iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Shows apps back in 2023, redirecting users to the ‌Apple TV‌ app for purchases. The apps remained available until now to provide customers with instructions on where to find their content, and to provide access to the iTunes Wish List. iPhone and iPad TV app with the launch of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2, and eliminated iTunes wishlists in those updates. tvOS 17.2 also got rid of wish lists. After customer complaints, wishlist options were returned, but Apple again started warning about the end of wishlists last week. Customers that still have an iTunes Wish List with movies and TV shows have received emails letting them know the feature is being removed. The emails include links to migrate those lists to the ‌Apple TV‌ watchlist feature as an alternative. Apple has been working to consolidate all movie and TV show viewing and buying to the TV app, so it's all in one place. There is no longer any iTunes-related app on the ‌Apple TV‌, but the ‌iPhone‌ still has an iTunes Store option for purchasing music. Apple has also updated the ‌Apple TV‌ Audio Format settings in tvOS 26.4. Dolby Atmos immersive audio has been replaced with Spatial Audio, and there is an option to convert to Dolby Digital 5.1, select Stereo Only, or turn on Auto mode. There's also a Continuous Audio Connection option for HDMI output. tvOS 26.4 is available to developers and public beta testers at the current time, with a release planned for spring.

      <title><![CDATA[Apple Working on Three AI Wearables: Smart Glasses, AI Pin, and AirPods With Cameras]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-ai-wearable-development/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple is speeding up its work on three AI wearable devices, reports Bloomberg. Apple is developing AI smart glasses, a wearable AI pin or pendant, and AI AirPods, all of which will connect to the iPhone and will interface with the smarter version of Siri that's in the works. Cameras will be integrated into all three products to allow the AI to "see" around the wearer and answer questions about the wearer's surroundings. Smart Glasses Apple's smart glasses will compete with the Meta Ray-Bans, as previously rumored. Apple recently provided its hardware engineering team with prototypes, and it is targeting a 2027 launch. Production on the glasses could begin as soon as December 2026. Cameras: Apple's smart glasses will have an advanced camera system with a high-resolution camera that's able to capture photos and videos, as well as a second camera that provides visual information to ‌Siri‌ and environmental context. The second camera will be able to interpret the user's surroundings and measure distance, similar to LiDAR on the ‌iPhone‌. Apple wants to make its glasses stand out from Meta's with a higher-end camera. No display: Apple's AI glasses will not include a display in the lens. Voice-based interface: Users will be able to ask ‌Siri‌ questions and take actions with voice commands. Capabilities: The AI glasses will support interacting with ‌Siri‌, making phone calls, listening to music, taking photos, and capturing video. Users will be able to look at an object and ask questions about it and get detailed navigation directions when walking. The glasses could have a version of Visual Intelligence, able to read physical text like event dates and then add that information to the calendar. Context-aware reminders are a possibility, as is live translation. Build quality: Apple is focusing on build quality as a way to differentiate the Apple Glasses from Meta's Ray-Bans. Apple considered partnering with an existing glasses brand and tested embedding hardware in off-the-shelf frames, but it has decided to develop its own frames in-house. Apple is using high-end materials "including acrylic elements" for a "premium feel." Design options: The Apple glasses will come in multiple sizes and colors. More styles could come over time. Embedded battery: The latest prototypes have a battery and all components embedded in the frame, and Apple is aiming for the glasses to serve as an all-day AI companion. AI Pin Apple's work on the AI pin is apparently in the early stages, and it's possible that it could still be canceled. If work continues, the AI pin could launch as soon as 2027. Cameras: The AI pin will have a lower-resolution camera to provide the AI with visual insight, but it won't be able to take photos or videos. The camera is always-on, recording what's around the wearer. Microphone: There is an included microphone for speaking with ‌Siri‌. Bloomberg says some Apple employees think of the AI pin as the "eyes and ears" of the ‌iPhone‌. iPhone accessory: Apple plans to market the AI pin as an ‌iPhone‌ accessory and not a standalone product. Dedicated chip: There is a dedicated chip in the AI pin, but it is similar to an AirPods chip and not very powerful. The ‌iPhone‌ will handle most of the processing. Speaker: The pin could include a speaker for back-and-forth conversations with ‌Siri‌, but Apple has not decided whether to add this functionality. Clip or pendant: The AI pin could attach to a shirt or a bag with a clip, and there's also a hole in the pin that can be used to attach it to a necklace. AirPods There have been multiple reports of Apple's work on AirPods with cameras, and development is at a later stage than the AI pin. AirPods with cameras are planned for as early as this year. Like the AI pin, the AirPods will have a low-resolution camera that's designed for information, not for photo capture. Siri Though ‌Siri‌ has been delayed and new Apple Intelligence features did not come in the first beta of iOS 26.4, Apple is still working on a chatbot version of ‌Siri‌ for iOS 27. The chatbot version of ‌Siri‌ will rely on Google-developed AI models. Future Devices In the future, Apple is planning to develop smart glasses with an augmented reality display, but that device is several years away. HomePod in the works, and a "compact indoor sensor for home security and automation."

      <description><![CDATA[It's not clear yet what this is for, but Apple is having an invite-only event not at Apple Park, but instead a joint event in New York City, London, and Shanghai on March 4. It might be time for all those M5 MacBook Pro, iPad, and iPhone 17e rumors to come true. Apple invite to New York City
We're curious what this is about. Apple doesn't typically have big product releases in New York City, let alone also in London and Shanghai simultaneously. They want to show something off, that's for sure.
That said, it may not necessarily be a major announcement. There is no sign of any streaming activity for the event, which reduces the chances of it being a big hardware release. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Rumors continue to say that Apple will release the first iPhone Fold in fall 2026, with the book-like design matching popular foldables already on the market. Companies like Samsung and Motorola also offer clamshell designs, similar to the iconic flip phones of the early 2000s.
Now, in a post on the Weibo Chinese social network, leaker Fixed Focus Digital claims that Apple could follow suit. But it's too early to know whether the phone will ever make its way to market. Rumor Score: Possible Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Apple's February 9, 2026 update to the CarPlay Developer Guide introduces a new CarPlay entitlement category for voice-driven conversational apps. The move creates an official path for third-party AI assistants to operate inside CarPlay rather than relying solely on Siri.
The change arrives as generative AI becomes more embedded across Apple platforms. CarPlay is next, but Apple is setting clear boundaries. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple previously accused Qualcomm of “double-dipping” as a result of the company’s policies over selling radio chips for use in iPhones. The Cupertino company had also objected to Qualcomm charging a percentage of the price of an iPhone rather than a fixed fee per chip.
Apple withdrew its claims back in 2024, but an independent class-action lawsuit was still being pursued on behalf of iPhone owners. This lawsuit has now been abandoned …

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-no-new-siri-features/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The first beta of iOS 26.4 is available to developers and public beta testers, and the software includes no new Siri features. There were expectations of at least some new Apple Intelligence ‌Siri‌ capabilities because of how long the delays have been and persistent rumors suggesting Apple was targeting an iOS 26.4 release, but we'll have to wait longer for ‌Siri‌ updates. After Apple announced a delay for the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ version of ‌Siri‌ in March 2025, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple had set an internal launch target for iOS 26.4. He repeated the iOS 26.4 timeline in several subsequent reports, and even at the end of January, he suggested that Apple would unveil the more personalized version of ‌Siri‌ in February. delayed until iOS 26.5 or iOS 27. Gurman said the ‌Siri‌ features will be spread across several upcoming iOS releases. Some or all of the new ‌Siri‌ features could be introduced in iOS 26.5, or Apple might wait for iOS 27, which will be previewed in June 2026 at WWDC. Apple first showed off the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ version of ‌Siri‌ at the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, and it was supposed to come in iOS 18. Apple had to upgrade ‌Siri‌'s architecture to make the promised functionality work, and so far, that's taken over a year. ‌Siri‌ is apparently taking too long to respond to requests, and some queries aren't processed properly, which is what led to the iOS 26.4 ‌Siri‌ delay. Engineers are apparently using iOS 26.5 for further ‌Siri‌ testing right now, so some functionality could come in that update. There's still a possibility that new ‌Siri‌ features will be introduced in a later iOS 26.4 beta, but that's not guaranteed. Apple has been working to add personalization, onscreen awareness, and the ability for ‌Siri‌ to do more in and between apps. Not all of the features are working reliably and Apple is said to be having continual issues with accuracy. CNBC that the new version of ‌Siri‌ would still be coming at some point in 2026. Apple has never given a timeline more specific than 2026, so there hasn't been a second actual delay, just a disappointment based on rumors of an iOS 26.4 launch. iOS 26 launch could still happen.

Wedbush took its Apple target price up to $350 in December 2025, based on high expectations for Apple Intelligence. Keeping that figure, it then repeated this expectation in January 2026 — and is now back to do so again, specifically because of recent rumors.
Those rumors claimed that testing of the new Siri is going poorly, and its improved features will be delayed, perhaps until iOS 27 in September. Consequently, investors have been selling off their Apple shares, but Wedbush says this is unwarranted. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

With the debut of the iPhone 15 range, Apple introduced an opt-in setting that limited battery charging to just 80%. The goal of the feature was to help preserve battery lifespan over time. iOS 18 gave iPhone users an additional option to limit battery charging anywhere from 80% to 100%.
Now, macOS has gained the same battery-preserving capability, thanks to the first macOS 26.4 developer beta, released on Monday. The macOS Tahoe version of the feature works the same way it does on iOS, featuring a slider that lets users select a specific battery charging limit.

Way back in March 2025, Apple announced that it would add support for end-to-end encryption to RCS messaging on iPhone. At the time, there were very few details about when the feature would be implemented.
We got our first hint that the feature was, at the very least, being worked on in January. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A new rumor claims Apple has no major redesign imminent for the iPad Pro, potentially leaving the flagship tablet in an extended cycle of incremental updates. iPad Pro might not see updates for a while
On February 16, Instant Digital posted that Apple won't be redesigning the iPad Pro significantly for a while. The report indicates that Apple will stick to routine chip updates without making major changes to the device's design.
The post states that the iPad Pro won't receive a major upgrade for years. The leaker attributes the pause to the high cost of OLED panels and limited sales growth following the last redesign.
Instant Digital has had a mixed track record with Apple leaks on Weibo. Sometimes they share accurate details like the iPhone 16 camera control button, but other times they promote claims that aren't supported by the facts or what actually happens.

It seems such an obvious thing — if Apple is running low on the Mac Studio, it's because a new one is coming. And it seems such an easy thing to spot, since the online Apple Store details how long the delivery time is for any item.
So if you used to be able to get a custom Mac Studio the day after tomorrow in most cases, but now Apple says it'll take weeks, clearly stocks are low.

      <description><![CDATA[With an Apple experience on March 4, the rumor mill is in overdrive. These are the best candidates — and the also-rans — for what Apple will launch and then have an "experience" to demo on March 4. The more likely Apple launches for early March
It seems the March 4 Apple Experience won't be an actual launch of new products in Apple's catalog, but instead capping off multiple announcements during the week. That gives Apple a lot of opportunity to promote multiple items.
With the breadth of rumored devices on the docket, including many anticipated for launch in early 2026. it certainly needs that opportunity. But, as ever, some have more chance of making an appearance than others. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple stake by 4% in the fourth quarter of 2025, but Apple remains the conglomerate's largest equity holding by a wide margin. Berkshire Hathaway trims its Apple investment
A February 17 regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows Berkshire trimmed its Apple position during the quarter ended December 31, 2025. Apple was still valued at roughly $62 billion within Berkshire's portfolio at year's end.
The filing also shows Berkshire sold 77% of its Amazon stake in the same quarter, a far more substantial reduction than the modest adjustment to Apple. The latest stock cut by Berkshire isn't a harbinger of doom but rather a routine portfolio adjustment. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple may return to its marketing playbook, delivering multiple press releases of big products in just a few days, then highlight them all at the international March 4 "experiences." Apple's experience logo has many layers. The announcement of a special event on March 4 has led to wild speculation of what Apple could introduce at the time. However, with so many oddities surrounding it all, it may not be as straightforward as people think.
On Tuesday, Daring Fireball's John Gruber proposed that Apple's reference of it as an "experience" day is unusual. The choice of holding the event on a Wednesday is also unexpected, especially when you factor in Apple's preference for Tuesday product announcements.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/perplexity-abandons-ai-advertising/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[AI company Perplexity is stepping away from advertising over concerns that it will erode user trust, despite moves by rivals to introduce ads as an alternative money-making strategy. Perplexity was one of the first AI services to embrace ads in 2024, after it ran tests where sponsored answers appeared under the chatbot's answers. That approach however was phased out last year, and executives at the company now say they don't plan to revisit it, according to the Financial Times. "A user needs to believe this is the best possible answer, to keep using the product and be willing to pay for it," a Perplexity executive told the publication. earlier this month to show ads to ChatGPT users who have a free account or a low-cost Go subscription. OpenAI has said ads will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides, nor will it provide advertisers with content from ChatGPT conversations. mocked OpenAI for its decision to show ads to users and has said it has no plans to do the same. The company argues that including ads in Claude would not be in line with its mission of creating a helpful assistant for work and deep thinking, and that users should not need to second-guess whether an AI is being helpful or "subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable." Google features advertising in AI mode and in its AI Overviews summaries on traditional search results. However, Google has not introduced ads into its Gemini chatbot so far. Tag: Perplexity

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/anthropic-releases-claude-sonnet-4-6/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Anthropic today updated its Sonnet model to version 4.6, and the company says it is the most capable Sonnet model to date with upgrades across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design. Claude Sonnet 4.6 is the default for users who have Free and Pro plans, and it has an updated 1M token context window. Sonnet 4.6 improves consistency and instruction following for coding, it's better at computer use tasks, and it can complete office tasks that previously required an Opus model. Sonnet 4.6 has human-level capability for tasks like navigating a complex spreadsheet or filling out a multi-step web form. According to Anthropic, Sonnet 4.6 has a "a broadly warm, honest, prosocial, and at times funny character, very strong safety behaviors, and no signs of major concerns around high-stakes forms of misalignment." It offers Opus-level intelligence at a more affordable price point, so it is practical for a wider range of tasks. Opus 4.6 is still the better option for agentic coding, agentic code use, and multidisciplinary reasoning, but Sonnet 4.6 offers measurable improvements over Sonnet 4.5. Tag: Anthropic

The star of the show is their new MagSafe power bank that combines Qi2.2 wireless charging, a built-in USB-C cable, and an integrated kickstand into a slim 10,000mAh design.

      <description><![CDATA[In the face of competition from Open AI and Meta, Apple is said to be redoubling its efforts to get a wearable pendant and camera-equipped AirPods right. A pin of the Apple Intelligence logo. Not an Apple Intelligence pin
In a bid to follow the AI marketplace trends, Apple is rumored to be working on a number of new products that take advantage of artificial intelligence. If a Tuesday report on the topic is correct, Apple is keen to make them a reality.

      <description><![CDATA[The 2026 revamp of Apple Intelligence and Siri is imminent, and Playlist Playground in iOS 26.4 shows Apple will continue to treat AI as a background tool, not a flagship feature. Apple Intelligence is meant to be a background feature
If you've been paying attention, Apple's strategy with artificial intelligence has always been about keeping it in the background. It augments human users rather than replacing them or stealing from them.
System-wide access to controls via app intents and the more personalized Siri won't or will be groundbreaking, depending on any given user's workflow. Apple isn't treating AI as some kind of world-altering paradigm that needs to overtake every part of the product. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

According to Apple's developer documentation, a new feature called Foveated Streaming is available with visionOS 26.4. It helps ensure processing power is saved by only rendering what the user is looking at in the highest resolution and limiting detail in the periphery.

Rosetta 2 was introduced as a way to allow apps made for Intel chips to continue working on Apple Silicon. Over five years after its introduction in November 2020, Apple's warning users that it is going away.
As part of Monday's first developer beta build of macOS Tahoe 26.4, Apple has included a warning that tells users that some apps on their Mac will eventually stop working. In cases where users launch an app that relies on Rosetta 2, a warning will appear, advising that the app won't work when it pulls support for the translation layer.

Apple's long-promised Apple Intelligence overhaul of Siri still hasn't appeared in public builds, but the delay reflects deliberate pacing rather than a product in trouble.
The company reset expectations in 2025, announcing that a more personalized Siri with deeper app integration would come in 2026.

      <description><![CDATA[On February 16, 2016, Apple published a statement it knew would be criticized, and laid out the reasons it would not bow to unfair government pressure. We're apparently in a very different world today. The White House is dominating Apple Park — image credits: Apple and the White House
Ten years ago on February 16, 2016, Apple drew a line in the sand. The FBI had cleverly and even callously timed an attack on the firm to take advantage of public outrage over the San Bernardino shootings.
Fourteen people had been murdered in a terrorist attack in California's San Bernardino in December 2015. By February 2016, then FBI director James Comey told senators that they had one of the killers' phones that they hadn't been able to open.

      <description><![CDATA[Historically, Apple's March has been oddly busy in recent years, but as the company teases its newest "special Apple experience" happening on March 4, 2026, here's a look back at what we've seen before, and what we might see this time. Apple used to deck out conference halls for its launches —- this time for the iPad 3
That March 4, 2026 event is invitation-only one in New York, London, and Shanghai, and won't be streamed. It's being called an Apple Experience, too, which is the term the company used for the January 2026 event around the Apple Creator Studio .
If this a product announcement, though, then there is a precedent for it. And while there weren't even any Apple March events at all until 2008, since then they have been wide-ranging. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's next event is happening on March 4, it's not at Apple Park. In Apple's marketing world, location definitely matters. Apple Park, where most Apple events take place
Whenever Apple announces a new event and sends out invitations, the immediate thought is that it is for the launch of a new product. The rumor mill is then immediately scoured for potential items to launch at the event.
What many industry observers don't immediately consider is where the event is taking place. The problem is, that historically has bearing on what Apple is about to say. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Reboot is a new weekly column (editor's note, that will run on Sundays going forward) covering some of the lighter stories within the Apple reality distortion field from the past seven days.

Filming of the fourth season of spy thriller Tehran was underway when Eden was discovered in an Athens hotel on Sunday. Discovered by her brother, Eden's death is being treated as a suicide initially, with an investigation underway to determine what happened to her.
Israeli public broadcaster Kan, which produces the show along with Apple TV, called Eden a senior figure in Israel's television industry, reports Deadline. She played a central role in creating some of Kan's major productions in her career. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The Ugreen NASync DH4300 is a very easy-to-use and affordable network attached storage appliance for beginners who need more capacity than your typical entry-level network storage appliance, or for folks who are still relying on a Time Capsule for backup. Ugreen NASync DH4300 Plus
We're getting to a point with cloud storage that in the long run, having a local cloud is a good idea. And, network attached storage (NAS) isn't just for networking experts anymore.
But, it's easy to underestimate needs. That local cloud basic user could go for entry-level options with two drives, which is fine for most, but when you start thinking about other stuff to do, simply isn't enough when data storage needs grow.

      <description><![CDATA[Hard drive prices will continue to be high for quite some time, as the needs of AI data centers continue to consume storage and raise prices for everyone. WD has run out of 2026 drive production capacity. Expect hard drives to stay expensive for a while. One of the major talking points about artificial intelligence has been its impact on memory prices. The demand has caused components to become more expensive to manufacturers like Apple, as well as to consumers, thanks to the build-out of infrastructure needed for AI.
Memory may have made headlines, but it's far from the only component feeling the squeeze. It's also happening to the hard drive market, too. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's February 2026 App Store data shows iOS 26 adoption closely tracking the pace set by iOS 18 in January 2025, and iPadOS 26 is ahead of iPadOS 18, undercutting claims that the upgrade cycle is faltering. Apple publishes OS 26 adoption data
Apple publishes operating system adoption rates based on devices that transacted on the App Store. The February 12, 2026 data can be measured against Apple's January 24, 2025 published figures for a like-for-like comparison.
The breakdown separates recently introduced hardware from the full active installed base. Because Apple publishes these numbers annually, it allows for a category-matched comparison between the 2025 and 2026 cycles at the same stage.

      <description><![CDATA[Apple includes privacy indicators in the upper-right corner of your Mac’s display to indicate when critical hardware is in use. An orange indicator means your microphone is in use, while a green indicator suggests the camera is in use. These indicators help users stay diligent about apps that may be using the camera or microphone legitimately or, in the worst case, unscrupulously.

      <description><![CDATA[When automating your smart home, much of the attention centers on cameras and lights, but I believe HomeKit door sensors are arguably among the most critical devices to add to your setup. I’ve written about Onvis before, but the Smart Security Alarm Contact Sensor (CS2) takes the concept of a simple door sensor and turns it into a lot more.

      <description><![CDATA[Finally, a relatively inexpensive storage and ports dock for the M4 Mac mini that isn't bandwidth constrained. Beelink Mate mini Dock
For many years, Thunderbolt and USB docks have been designed to neatly fit underneath your Mac mini. There have been good ones, and bad ones.
In the 15 years I've been doing this gig facing the Internet, I've repeatedly seen the same problem crop up in terms of bandwidth. More recently, I've reviewed a pile of hubs that use 10 gigabit USB-C instead of 40 gigabit plus Thunderbolt, and manufacturers somehow expect external storage, USB ports, and an HDMI connection to all work fine with that 10 gigabits per second of bandwidth.

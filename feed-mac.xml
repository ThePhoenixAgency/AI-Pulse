That’s because rumors for the better part of a year have pointed to this update as the one to bring the revamped Siri that has been expected since 2024. However, a rumor last week dampened those expectations considerably. Now it’s unclear if the 26.4 updates will have any of the “new Siri” at all, while some of its major features get pushed back.
Still, 26.4 seems like it should be a larger-than-usual update with several new features that aren’t Siri related.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[News that the improved Siri is delayed don't fully ring true, but tales of Apple Health+ being at least trimmed down do. Plus one in four smartphones is now an iPhone, and Apple Creator Studio continues to have surprises, all on the AppleInsider+ podcast. One in four smartphones in the world is now an iPhone, making it hard to call Apple an underdog
Sometimes news can be too bad to be true. While there is a report that all of the key new Siri features have been delayed, it doesn't quite hold water.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple may return to its marketing playbook, delivering multiple press releases of big products in just a few days, then highlight them all at the international March 4 "experiences." Apple's experience logo has many layers. The announcement of a special event on March 4 has led to wild speculation of what Apple could introduce at the time. However, with so many oddities surrounding it all, it may not be as straightforward as people think.
On Tuesday, Daring Fireball's John Gruber proposed that Apple's reference of it as an "experience" day is unusual.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple has made a major announcement this week that could affect the software you use, especially if it’s an older app. In a support document, Apple wrote that it will start to phase out Rosetta functionality with macOS 28. That means in two years, apps that were written for Intel-based Macs will no longer run on M-series Macs, except for “certain older, unmaintained games.”
When Apple began its switch from Intel chips to its own M-series chips in 2020, it changed the architecture of the underlying workings of the Mac.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[AI company Perplexity is stepping away from advertising over concerns that it will erode user trust, despite moves by rivals to introduce ads as an alternative money-making strategy. Perplexity was one of the first AI services to embrace ads in 2024, after it ran tests where sponsored answers appeared under the chatbot's answers. That approach however was phased out last year, and executives at the company now say they don't plan to revisit it, according to the Financial Times.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Earlier this month, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple had scaled back its plans to launch a new Health+ service and was revisiting its entire health and fitness strategy.
While this could be seen as being another sign of trouble at Apple, as the company is currently mired in an ongoing narrative about its inability to ship AI features it promised nearly two years ago, I choose to see this as the opposite: a promising early sign that Apple’s executives are recognizing that its headlong charge into chasing services revenue might be coming at too high a cost.]]></description>

Apple used to deck out conference halls for its launches —- this time for the iPad 3
That March 4, 2026 event is invitation-only one in New York, London, and Shanghai, and won't be streamed. It's being called an Apple Experience, too, which is the term the company used for the January 2026 event around the Apple Creator Studio .]]></description>

What many industry observers don't immediately consider is where the event is taking place. The problem is, that historically has bearing on what Apple is about to say.]]></description>

While I appreciate having these indicators, they can become a distraction when taking screenshots or recording my Mac’s external display.]]></description>

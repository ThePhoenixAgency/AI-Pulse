      <description><![CDATA[With iOS 26.4, CarPlay users will be able to use third-party chatbots with ‌CarPlay‌. AI services like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT will be accessible through the ‌CarPlay‌ system for the first time. Apple's ‌CarPlay‌ Developer Guide [PDF] lists voice-based conversational apps as a supported app type starting with iOS 26.4. Apple is implementing a new voice control screen that will let apps provide visual feedback for voice-based conversational apps. AI apps that integrate ‌CarPlay‌ will need to add support for the voice control screen while voice-based services are active. There is a specific entitlement for voice-based conversational apps, and companies that make chatbots will need to update their apps to add ‌CarPlay‌ support. Siri voice controls while in the vehicle. iPhone functions. There also won't be a wake word option to activate a third-party app, so users will still need to open the app to use the chatbot. After an app is launched, the customizable voice control screen will give users vehicle-optimized chatbot experiences. Related Roundups: iOS 26, iPadOS 26

      <title><![CDATA[iOS 26.4's Major New CarPlay Feature Revealed]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/ios-26-4-major-new-carplay-feature-revealed/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Back at WWDC 2025, Apple revealed that it was planning to allow CarPlay users to watch video via AirPlay in their vehicles while they are not driving, and the first beta of iOS 26.4 suggests the feature may be nearing availability. There are several new references to CarPlay video streaming functionality within the iOS 26.4 beta's source code. The feature is not yet visible to users, but software developer Thomas Dye managed to get it working to some extent in Xcode's CarPlay simulator on the Mac, and he showed it off in a recent YouTube video (via 9to5Mac). On an iPhone connected to CarPlay, it appears that videos in any AirPlay-supported app can be played on the car's display. In the Dynamic Island, there is a button that allows you to show the video on the iPhone instead, when you want to. The demo also reveals that an Apple TV app will be available on CarPlay, allowing you to access shows and movies from the Apple TV streaming service and your own library. There is also a tab for accessing MLS Season Pass. However, it is not entirely clear if the Apple TV app will actually be this fully featured on the real version of CarPlay. The simulator provides an early albeit fairly clunky look at CarPlay's video streaming in action. The feature will likely be available by time iOS 26.4 is released to the general public in late March or early April, but there is a chance it will get held back until iOS 26.5 or later if Apple needs more time to wrap up development. indicates that automakers will need to implement support for the CarPlay video functionality, due to the safety requirement that the vehicle be parked, so it may take some time for the feature to widely roll out.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/iphone-17-pro-max-becomes-most-traded-in-phone/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[New trade-in data indicates that Apple's iPhone 17 Pro Max has rapidly become the single most traded-in smartphone. According to a new report from SellCell, Apple's latest flagship iPhone has quickly risen to the top of the independent trade-in market, accounting for 11.5% of all devices appearing in the top-20 trade-in rankings just months after release. The analysis is based on SellCell internal trade-in data and secondary market pricing trends gathered from 40 independent ‌iPhone‌ buyers. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max's share of the top-20 trade-in rankings increased from about 5.1% in late November to 11.5% by early February, more than doubling in approximately 12 weeks. 86% of traded-in units were categorized as being in mint or good condition, suggesting many owners are selling soon after purchase. iPhone 16 Pro Max and ‌iPhone‌ 13 sit at 7.2% of trade-ins each. The top-20 devices collectively represent around 47% of all trade-in activity. Trade-in rankings typically reflect a wide mix of devices at different points in their lifecycle, with older models often dominating resale volume due to large installed bases and the natural upgrade cycle. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max's rapid rise is therefore notable because the device only entered the market relatively recently yet has already become the most frequently traded-in model across the tracked channels. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max has apparently lost approximately 25.4% of its value since launch when measuring average resale prices for mint-condition devices over a 145-day period. Over an equivalent timeframe, the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max lost roughly 32.5% of its value. This represents more than 7% lower depreciation for the newer model and translates to as much as $95 in additional retained value compared with the previous generation over the same period.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/low-cost-macbook-expected-on-march-4/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple will announce its rumored low-cost MacBook at its event on March 4, with the device coming in a selection of bold color options, according to a known leaker. Earlier this week, Apple announced a "special Apple Experience" for the media in New York, London, and Shanghai, taking place on March 4, 2026 at 9:00am ET. Instant Digital" said that the color scheme of the Apple logo graphic used for the upcoming "Apple Experience" should match the colors of the new entry-level Mac. The invite graphic shows a 3D Apple logo made up of transparent discs in yellow, green, and blue. The post effectively constitutes a claim that the device is set to arrive at the event. In June 2025, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the more-affordable MacBook could come in silver, blue, pink, and yellow finishes, which would match the entry-level iPad. In his latest newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple has tested a range of playful color options for its upcoming low-cost MacBook, going well beyond the muted tones available on its current laptop lineup. Gurman said the colors tested so far include light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray, although he added that it is unlikely all of them will ship. The color palette would make the budget MacBook the most colorful laptop Apple has offered since the iBook G3 era in the late 90s, which included Tangerine, Blueberry, Indigo, Graphite, and Key Lime. iPhone chip, likely the A18 Pro, rather than an M-series processor. It will likely retail for well below $1,000.

      <title><![CDATA[10 Reasons to Wait for Apple's iPhone 18 Pro]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/reasons-to-wait-iphone-18-pro/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max. One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle this year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027. Overall Design iPhone 17 Pro Style Rumors suggest the iPhone 18 Pro lineup will largely retain the same design as the iPhone 17 Pro models. The rear camera system will look identical to the current generation, featuring a raised "plateau" with three lenses arranged in a triangle. Display sizes are also expected to remain unchanged, with the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max continuing to use 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch panels, respectively – the same dimensions introduced with the iPhone 16 Pro series. iPhone 18 Pro models could drop the current two-tone look of the rear casing found on the iPhone 17 Pro in favor of a more seamless aesthetic. For the next-generation models, Apple has apparently updated the back-glass "replacement process" to minimize the color difference between the Ceramic Shield 2 glass and the aluminum frame, resulting in a more unified appearance. Next-Level Battery Life Thicker Chassis The iPhone 18 Pro Max will feature a bigger battery for continued best-in-class battery life, claims a Chinese leaker. The Weibo user known as "Digital Chat Station" said that the ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max will have a battery capacity of 5,100 to 5,200 mAh. (The iPhone 17 Pro Max has the biggest ‌iPhone‌ battery to date at 5,088 mAh. Apple says it has a battery life of up to 39 hours.) According to another rumor, the body of the iPhone 18 Pro Max will be slightly thicker than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, raising the device's weight to around 243 grams. That would make the iPhone 18 Pro Max approximately 3 grams more than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is currently the heaviest model Apple has produced. A larger battery is the most likely cause. Smaller Dynamic Island Under-Screen Face ID? Rumors continue to circulate about whether the iPhone 18 Pro models will introduce under-display Face ID, but reports remain divided on when the technology will actually arrive. The feature would move the TrueDepth camera system beneath the display, eliminating the need for the current Dynamic Island cutout. Wayne Ma of The Information, Apple is targeting a design without a Dynamic Island, replacing it with a single pinhole camera in the upper-left corner of the screen. However, other sources dispute that claim. Display analyst Ross Young believes under-display Face ID is possible for the iPhone 18 Pro, but says a smaller Dynamic Island will still be present. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has echoed this view, reporting that the new models will feature a slimmed-down Dynamic Island rather than removing it entirely. Apple is also said to be testing new camera miniaturization technology to reduce the size of the front-facing camera currently located within the Dynamic Island. claimed the Dynamic Island cutout on the iPhone 18 Pro models will be approximately 35% narrower than it is on the iPhone 17 Pro models. Specifically, they said it will have a width of around 13.5mm, down from around 20.7mm Instant Digital has offered yet another version of events, saying the Dynamic Island will shrink in size, but that under-display Face ID and camera technology won't debut this year. Overall, the consensus suggests Apple may be refining the Dynamic Island before fully transitioning to an all-screen design in future generations. A20 Pro Chip 2nm Process The iPhone 18 Pro models will use Apple's A20 chip, based on TSMC's 2nm process for power and efficiency improvements. A move to 2nm fabrication increases transistor density, which will enable higher performance. The A20 series is expected to deliver roughly a 15 percent speed gain and about 30 percent better efficiency compared with the A19 series used in Apple's iPhone 17 models. Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) technology, suggesting at least some A20 chips will have RAM integrated directly onto the same wafer as the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, rather than sitting adjacent to the chip and connected via a silicon interposer. This could contribute to faster performance for both overall tasks and Apple Intelligence, and longer battery life from improved power efficiency. C2 Modem Replacing Qualcomm Apple plans to include its next-generation C2 modem in the iPhone 18 Pro models, according to supply chain analyst Jeff Pu. The chip will succeed the C1 modem, which debuted in the lower-cost iPhone 16e as Apple's first in-house cellular modem, and the C1X modem chip in the iPhone Air, which Apple says is up to 2× faster than the C1. The C2 is expected to bring faster speeds, improved power efficiency, and support for mmWave 5G in the United States – a feature missing from the C1 and C1X. Apple's modem roadmap is part of a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on Qualcomm, which currently supplies 5G modems for the rest of the iPhone lineup. The company has been working on developing its own cellular chips for years, aiming for deeper integration and greater control over power management and performance. New Camera Sensor Samsung-Made Samsung is working on a new three-layer stacked image sensor, reportedly intended for the iPhone 18. The sensor, referred to as PD-TR-Logic, integrates three layers of circuitry, which would improve camera responsiveness, reduce noise, and increase dynamic range. The leak comes from a source known as "Jukanlosreve," who claims the sensor is being developed specifically for Apple's 2026 iPhone lineup. Sony has long been Apple's sole image sensor supplier, so Samsung's entry would be a big shift in the iPhone's camera supply chain. Variable Aperture DSLR-Style Apple intends to equip this year's iPhone 18 Pro models with a variable aperture lens, according to reports. Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station claims the main rear camera – what Apple calls the 48-megapixel Fusion camera – on both iPhone 18 Pro models will offer variable aperture, which would be a first for the iPhone. A variable-aperture system physically adjusts the lens opening, letting more light in for low-light shots or narrowing the opening for brighter scenes and deeper depth of field. November 2024 that Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models will get the feature. 5G Satellite Internet Non-Terrestrial Data According to a report by The Information, Apple plans to add support for 5G networks that operate via satellites rather than Earth-based towers as early as next year. This advancement would allow future iPhones to gain full internet connectivity through satellite, not just limited emergency features. If Apple meets the 2026 target, the first devices to feature 5G satellite internet would likely be the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and the long-rumored foldable iPhone. Apple partners with Globalstar for its iPhone satellite features, but there is currently no service that delivers full 5G satellite internet directly to a smartphone, and the report did not specify who would supply it. Simplified Camera Control New Design Apple is reportedly working to simplify the Camera Control button's design on iPhone 18 models in order to reduce costs. The current Camera Control button on iPhone 17 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the force sensor recognizes different pressure levels for taps, presses, and swipes. remove the capacitive sensing layer and retain only pressure sensing recognition in the second iteration to achieve all Camera Control functions on the iPhone 18. The simplified version is not about reducing functionality in the button, but about saving money. The current solution is said to be very expensive for Apple and is generating costly after-sales repairs. New Colors Three in Testing Apple is rumored to be testing three new color options for the iPhone 18 Pro models: burgundy, brown, and purple. A burgundy finish would mark the first time the Pro and Pro Max models have been offered in any shade of red, apart from the lighter (PRODUCT)RED used on earlier devices. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were previously available in Deep Purple, and Apple has never released an iPhone in a genuinely brown color.

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Code references in the latest version of iOS point to what might sound like a surprising new feature in CarPlay: the ability to play movies and TV shows in your car.
iOS 26.4, which has just launched in beta form, contains two giveaway strings, both of which mention an important safety measure. “When you’re not driving,” reads the first, “open Apple TV on iPhone and review the privacy information.” While the second reads: “When you’re not driving, sign in to Apple TV on iPhone.”
These code strings were spotted by the MacRumors analyst Aaron Perris, who posted his discovery to Twitter/X. The Apple news site 9to5Mac further spotted five references that contain the words “CarPlayVideoPlayback,” juxtaposed with terms such as “ClimateControls” and “Notifications.”
It’s worth noting that while these snippets point to the feature approaching launch, the concept is not a total surprise. “Video in the car” was originally announced as part of the iOS 26 update last year, and is still mentioned in the CarPlay section of Apple’s developer site.
“AirPlay video in the car enables people to watch their favorite videos from iPhone right on their CarPlay display when they aren’t driving,” the page explains. “Integrate support for CarPlay with AirPlay video to enable this feature in your car.”
That’s the key: it was left up to automakers to authorise and integrate the feature. And up to now, no automaker has chosen to do that, or announced that it intends to do so in the future. But this latest discovery hints that progress is finally being made.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Best laptop power banks for Apple MacBook 2026]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/2395511/best-laptop-power-banks-for-apple-macbook.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Many of us are quite used to carrying around a handy power bank to top up our iPhone batteries during a long day away from a power socket, but these pocketable battery packs are usually not powerful enough to keep an unplugged and energy-hungry MacBook going all day.
We’ve rounded up the best portable laptop power banks with battery capacities high enough to recharge a fading Apple MacBook if you won’t be able to plug it into an electrical outlet for some time.
Despite new laptops boasting improved battery life duration, it’s easy for your trusty MacBook to lose power after a day of intense meetings and PowerPoint presentations. No one wants to see the Mac’s “Your battery is running low” warning, especially when halfway through watching a downloaded Netflix series on a long-haul flight.
We looked at seven main factors for recommending laptop power banks: battery capacity, charging speed, total power output, power input, USB ports, portability and safety. For more details on each see below this list of the best MacBook power banks.
Power vs portability
As a rule, the higher the battery capacity, the larger and heavier the power bank. We have included size and weight so you can determine if each power bank suits your traveling needs. Some laptop power banks are built to last in the great outdoors so will feature more rugged IP-rated shells; read on for our reviews below.
There are much smaller, lighter and more portable power banks for phones—check out our recommendations of the best power banks for iPhone. You could use some of these to recharge a laptop but we recommend the power banks tested and reviewed here for the best results when powering up a laptop.
There are some giant power banks, usually called portable power stations, that can keep a family going all weekend, but they are way too large to carry with you on your travels. We have tested the most MacBook-friendly models in our roundup of the best portable power stations.
Macworld Test Score
We test each power bank’s real-world charging prowess by recharging a spent 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro from 0% to 100% (or as far as it gets) and then repeat, adding the two percentages together to create a comparable Test Score.
Which power bank is best for your MacBook in 2026?
We have indicated which models of MacBook we think each power bank is best suited to, but that doesn’t mean you can’t pair any with different MacBooks. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W so owners of that model should look for a PD 3.1 power bank. But even a 13-inch MacBook Air will work well with the higher-capacity power banks. They might not charge any faster, but they will be recharged more times if you pick a high-capacity battery pack. Pros

Macworld Test Score: 125%
The Anker Prime 26K Power Bank (300W) is one of the most powerful laptop power banks that you can match with your MacBook. It is a great fit with the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has a battery rated at around the same watt hours (99.6WH) as this power bank (99.75Wh).
There are three USB ports. Each of the two USB-C ports can be used to power at 140W. Attach Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable or the included 240W USB-C cable to the power back and you can utilize one of the 140W PD 3.1 ports to fast-charge the 16-inch Pro. Indeed, with its 300W total output at your disposal you could fast-charge two of the top-end MacBooks at the same time and still have enough juice to fast-charge your iPhone!
Anker claims that you can fast-charge that top-end MacBook Pro up to 50% in 27 minutes. In our tests, we charged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to full power with enough left over to power it back to 25% on the second recharge.
You can recharge the power bank itself to 50% in under 150 minutes using the two USB-C ports at the same time at an impressive 250W.
This is a sophisticated power bank with some tricks of its own. It can be controlled by an app, which gives real-time charging stats (Remaining Charging Time and Input and Output power indicators) and can be optimized to help extend the battery life of the devices being charged as well as its own. You can even use the app’s Find Device feature to activate a sound alert from the power bank when you need to locate it.
Anker also sells a 27K Prime Power Bank, available in either black or gold colors. We prefer the 26K model as it’s a little smaller, performed better in our tests, and out guns the 27K model in total output (300W vs 250W) and input (250W vs 170W).
Who should buy the Anker Prime 26K 300W Power Bank?
Powerful enough to charge two 16-inch MacBooks at the same time, this power bank is a great travelling companion for any of Apple’s laptops. Both its 300W total output and 250W input are top-end for a truly portable power bank.
Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro. Pros
Large battery capacity

Macworld Test Score: 120%
Although a little larger and heavier than the Anker Prime 26K 300W Power Bank, reviewed above, the EcoFlow RAPID Pro 27K Power Bank (300W) has a hidden weapon in its battle for the best MacBook power bank: a built-in retractable USB-C cable tucked away in its base—saving you from carrying a spare cable around with you and keeping your travel bag neat and tidy.
Like the Anker Prime 26K, this power bank can fast-charge two 16-inch MacBook Pros at full pelt. It boasts the same 200W total output, and has two more USB-C ports—both at a potential 65W—but no legacy USB-A port. If you need a USB-A port, look to the Anker Prime instead. USB-A aside, it can recharge up to four devices at the same time, although. With three devices it can output at 140W, 95W and 65W—enough for three MacBooks at the same time. And using all four charging points, still allows for two MacBooks at 140W. with the remaining two USB-C ports sharing 20W.
In our tests it scored 120%—a little lower than the Anker Prime’s 125% but nothing substantial in comparison. It can be recharged itself at 280W, which is a little faster than its Anker rival.
Who should buy the EcoFlow RAPID Pro 27K 300W Power Bank?
As powerful as the Anker Prime 26K Power Bank and boasting a built-in USB-C cable plus an extra port, the EcoFlow RAPID Pro is a real rival for the crown. If you can take the (minimal) extra weight and don’t need a USB-A port, it is highly if only for the retractable cable.

The Ugreen 48000mAh 300W Portable Power Bank is the missing link between a laptop power bank and a full-blown power station. It has a huge battery capacity but is still portable, although you wouldn’t want to carry it around in your backpack all day, and it’s too powerful to take on a commercial flight.
It has a handle so is carriable, but the bulk and weight mean it is one to move around inside or carry in a car. It would be the perfect power companion on a camping trip. It’s not super-heavy, but it is noticeably larger than the other laptop power banks tested here.
Keep it powered up in case of power outages and it should keep your laptop and phone going for days. In our tests we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro 1.8 times, so you can expect to get maybe as many as two charges for a MacBook Air. The Pro charged from 5% to 90% in an hour, which impressed us.
There are five ports (three USB-C and two USB-A) with a maximum simultaneous power output of 300W. As it has a 140W PD 3.1 USB-C port, it can be used to fast charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro. At the same time, you could charge another top-end MacBook Pro at 100W, and use one of the USB-A ports at 22.5W.
The smart display shows the remaining battery, total input and output power.
Who should buy the Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank (300W)?
Portable but certainly not pocketable, this is the border between power banks and power stations and would be a great travel gadget if you have a vehicle to carry it in. It is also a mini-prepper’s safeguard against power outages at home.

Retractable cables are very in right now—although nicely tucked away when not in use—for power banks and chargers. This 20K Ugreen Nexode Power Bank has one 2.1-foot retractable 100W USB-C cable nestled and ready for action right next to another 100W USB-C port and a 33W USB-A port.
At under 19oz it’s a little lighter than the cable-friendly Anker 25K 165W power bank, reviewed below, and is half an inch shorter, too. Although it matches the Anker on 165W maximum power output and 100W ports it does have a smaller battery capacity—although is therefore $20 cheaper. In our tests the 25K Anker recharged a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 92% while this 20K Ugreen power bank reached a respectable 78%.
In the battle for power and cable convenience, these two power banks must be chosen on capacity, portability and price.
Who should buy the Ugreen Nexode 20K 165W Power Bank?
This mid-range laptop power bank is compact and lightweight with a handy retractable cable, and will get your MacBook back up to about three-quarters power on a single recharge. Ugreen Ugreen sells another 20K model with a built-in USB-C charging cable. The $79 Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh 130W (above) is shorter at 5.1 x 2.1 x 1.9 inches (12.9 x 5.3 x 4.8cm) and $20 cheaper with the same 20K capacity but a lower max power output of 130W vs 165W. It weighs fractionally less than the 165W Nexode. Buy the 130W model if all you need is to charge a MacBook at 100W and an iPhone at 30W—this stubbier cousin may be all you need. It’s integrated 5.4-inch USB-C cable—useful for MacBooks and later iPhones—is nowhere near as long as the 165W model’s 2.1ft retractable cable but it can double up as a carry handle. Buy the 165W model if you regularly charge two laptops at the same time: one at 100W and the other at 65W. On both 20K models, the USB-A output can be handy for legacy devices.

The performance is impressive—we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to a respectable 92%, not far off the 100% from its slightly higher-capacity sibling Anker 27650mAh power bank—but what we love about this laptop battery pack is its handy 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable USB-C cable that means you don’t have to carry one with you when you take the power bank walkies. There’s even a second built-in USB-C cable that doubles up as a carrying loop.
Each USB-C port can output and provide input at 100W.
The cable wraps neatly into a groove at the top of the power bank. There’s spare USB-C and USB-A ports on one side, so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Note that if you want to charge more than one device, they must share the maximum output of 165W between them. However, 165W can only be supplied by two devices; with three and four devices, the maximum output is limited to 133W, although that is likely enough for most needs.
It’s available in either Space Black or Silver.
With its integrated cables this is one of the the most travel friendly laptop power bank we’ve tested.
A cheaper alternative is the 65W Baseus Free2Pull Power Bank that features one retractable USB-C cable, which is available in the U.S. at Amazon or in the U.K. via AliExpress.
Who should buy the Anker Power Bank (25K, 165W) with Cables?
If you frequently recharge multiple devices at the same time, maybe one integrated USB-C cable won’t be enough for you. This power bank boasts two cables, and performed well in our tests.

The INIU P62-E1 20000mAh (65W) Power Bank may have a dull name but it stands out a mile with its colorful looks—it’s available in six bold colors—and dare-to-be-different compact shape.
Not just fun to look at and easy to hold, it performed excellently in our tests, recharging a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 87% from a flat start, outperforming our 20K power bank, the Ugreen Nexode 20000mAh Power Bank, reviewed higher up, by nearly 10%. That Ugreen power bank features an integrated retractable USB-C cable and is more powerful with 100W outputs and a maximum 165W power—beating the 65W INIU.
The INIU P62-E1 might not have a retractable cable but it does boast a removable USB-C cable that creates a handy carrying loop.
While 65W is a little lacking—but not unusable—for the Pro MacBooks it’s ample for the MacBook Air. Who should buy the INIU Cougar 20K (65W) Power Bank?
Stand out from the crowd with this cute and compact laptop power bank that offers impressive performance for MacBooks that don’t require top-end power output to fast charge. That said, even MacBook Pro owners may desire something as lovely as the Cougar.

The Anker Prime 20K Power Bank is a laptop power bank that is lighter and smaller than the top-end Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank, but boasts the same number of USB ports.
Anker has a couple of 20K laptop power banks that are worth considering. The latest model is the 3-port Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (220W), which boasts two 140W PD 3.1 fast-charging USB-C ports and a 22.5W USB-A. When charging with all three ports at the same time, it offers two 100W outputs and a 20W. With two it can output two USB-C at 110W or one at 140W and the USB-A at 22.5W.
The older but slightly cheaper Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (200W) doesn’t feature the 140W PD 3.1 USB-C ports, instead packing two 100W USB-C ports and a generous 65W USB-A port. That doesn’t rule it out as a battery pack for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it can’t fast-charge Apple’s largest laptop. Its maximum output of 200W is a little below the 220W model.
Both feature a clear display but only the 220W model works with the Anker app. While the 27650mAh Anker Prime can be charged itself at 200W, the two Anker 20K Power Banks can be charged at a lower, but still reasonable, 100W using just one of its USB-C ports.
The 200W model is noticeably shorter than the 220W, measuring 4.9 x 2.1 x 2 inches (12.7 x 5.5 x 5cm) compared to the 220W’s 5.8 x 2 x 1.7 inches (4.4 x 5.0 x 14.7cm), although the 220W is a little lighter at 1.1lbs (510g) compared to the 200W’s 1.17lbs (529g).
The 200W model is cheaper at $139 compared to the 220W model’s $179 price tag, but both appear quite expensive when compared to some rival 20K power banks; see the Ugreen 20K Power Bank reviewed below. The 200W model fared impressively in our recharge test.
Who should buy the Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (220W or 200W)?
Although priced at a premium, these are great options for the smaller MacBooks unless you need as much power in the bank as you can carry. If you don’t need the 140W outputs, the 200W model will save you some cash, or consider the lower-output Ugreen Nexode 20K Power Bank below..
Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Thomas Bergbold Ugreen’s equivalent to the Anker Prime 20K Power Banks is the much cheaper $89 Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh, pictured above. The battery capacities of both are identical, but the Ugreen is noticeably lighter (1lb or 480g) even though its dimensions are closely aligned: 5.1 x 2.1 x 2.0 inches (13.1 x 5.4 x 5.1cm). Each has a smart display that tells you more than enough about what’s going on between the power bank and the devices being charged.
The Ugreen Nexode is a more portable solution, but we still prefer the Anker Prime model for both its impressive USB ports. The Anker has two 100W USB-C ports, while the Ugreen’s USB-C ports are rated at 100W and 30W. As the Ugreen power bank has a maximum power output of 130W, this doesn’t matter, but the Anker can pump out up to 220W simultaneously, making its powerful ports more useful. Power input is also better on the Anker (100W) vs the Ugreen (65W).
However, we’ve seen the Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh priced a lot more competitively than the Anker Prime 20K, and that weight difference may be important to you. Also, for the lone traveller one port for the MacBook and another for fast-charging an iPhone or iPad might be all that’s required. Read our full Ugreen Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh 130W review.

The Cuktech 15 Air laptop power bank we tested might not perform to the same degree as more expensive rivals but offers great value for money, and is hand-grip portable. Its color smart display has all the charging info you should require: battery level, input and output power, and estimated recharge time.
Its 15K (15000mAh) battery managed to charge our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to 54% power. That’s not as impressive as the 20K power banks reviewed here but it’s one of the cheapest MacBook battery packs that we trust.
You can use it as a multiple-charge iPhone power bank, too: it should charge an iPhone 17 Pro Max around 1.6 times. With the three USB ports all in action, you can charge the MacBook at 65W and share the remaining 33W between the other USB-C and USB-A ports.

The Cuktech 15 laptop power bank we tested might not perform to the same degree as more expensive rivals but offers great value for money.
Despite its somewhat confusing name, the Cuktech 15 has a 20K (20000mAh) battery that managed to charge our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to 60% power. That’s not as impressive as other 20K power banks reviewed here but at under $50/£50 it’s one of the cheapest MacBook battery pack that we trust.
You can use it as a multiple-charge iPhone power bank, too: it should charge an iPhone 15 around 3.5 times. You double-click the power button to enter low-power mode for devices such as a smartwatch or headphones.

A little cheaper than the higher-capacity Cuktech 20, reviewed below, this slim laptop power bank can also fast-charge even the 16-inch MacBook Pro with its 140W output. The 20 looks the better buy in terms of capacity and at a similar price, but the 15 Ultra has a special feature known as Beast Mode.
While the 25000mAh battery of the Cuktech 20 is certainly worth the small extra investment on this 15 Ultra in terms of capacity, this 20000mAh power bank impresses with its super-speedy 165W input, which means you can recharge itself faster than most using Beast Mode where you use both the USB-C ports to recharge the power bank up to 70% in around 20 minutes.
The smart display shows you what each of the ports is doing, battery status, connected devices, and when the unit is powering up in Beast Mode.

Outdoor adventurers and in-the-field professionals need devices that are stronger than softy office desk jockeys and occasional airport travelers, and the Sandberg Survivor boasts a tough !P66 shell that is impervious to water and dust. As such it is bigger than most power banks but it would survive outdoors much longer and has a big enough battery to keep a bunch of devices charged up before being introduced to a wall charger again.
Behind a protective rubber flap there are three USB ports: two old-school USB-A and one USB-C. We would have preferred more USB-C, which is used on most modern devices, and that singular USB-C port is also where you will charge the power bank itself. The USB-C port outputs at up to 65W and receives power at 60W. Each of the USB-A ports can output at 18W. Total simultaneous power output is 65W. Uniquely, there is also a 24W DC 5525 port if your devices can be powered using this connection.
As it charges at a maximum 65W, it’s better suited to the lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro and 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air, rather than the more powerful versions of the 14- and 16-inch Pro MacBooks that prefer a 100W or higher charger. That said, if your 16-inch Pro is on an outdoors adventure, the Survivor will still charge it, just a little slower than a 100W or 140W power bank.
Who should buy the Sandberg Survivor Powerbank?
If the other laptop power banks reviewed here look too fragile for your next trip to the mountains or jungle, the Survivor is built to take some punishment—just look out for your MacBook! Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air or any adventurer’s laptop Pros

Built for travel, this combo 4-in-1 wall charger and 10K battery pack can charge a laptop at 45W as a power bank and at 65W when plugged directly into a wall power socket. It comes with international plug adapters for U.K., E.U. and AU/NZ that slip onto the built-in U.S. foldable prongs—great for travel or just use in your own region. It even has a fold-out rubber handle that you can use to attach it to your backpack while hiking.
Its 10000mAh battery capacity is certainly not the highest of the laptop power banks we have reviewed here, but it did recharge a completely faded 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro back up to 45%, which should get you an extra few hours charge when on the move, depending on your laptop’s battery health.
Its two USB-C and one USB-A ports make it a capable AC wall charger, and a magnetic side pad works as a 15W Qi2 wireless charger for the MagSafe-ready iPhone 12 to 16 families. If charging by wall, the USB-C port output is 65W. When operating as a power bank, the USB-C port outputs 45W, unless also wireless charging when the maximum out put is 30W (15W wireless plus 15W USB-C).
A smart displays shows the power bank’s remaining battery charge, remaining time to full charge, real time output/input, and temperature.

While certainly portable it isn’t one to slip in your pocket or clamp to your phone on the move—the Nexode Qi2 is aimed at the iPhone using laptop owner.

The Cuktech 20 Power Bank 25000mAh 140W PD 3.1 power bank looks a lot like the Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, in a tall format with an informative smart display.
As with the Anker, there are three USB ports, with one at the required 140W for fast-charging a 16-inch MacBook Pro. The other two ports aren’t as powerful as the Anker’s though: 45W vs 140W, and 30W vs 65W.
An M2 MacBook Air should be fully charged with a little power left over for your iPhone, AirPods or Apple Watch.
Power input is also not as great, but at 110W it’s impressive enough compared to most. Maximum simultaneous power output is 210W—again not as high as the Anker but still respectable. The Cuktech’s display gives more data than the Anker, which is informative for wattage junkies but probably overkill for most of us, who just need to know how much battery life remains in the power bank. Anker’s dedicated app is perhaps more useful. Again, this is a nice to have and the Cuktech power bank does the important stuff of recharging the laptop at a price point that is noticeably lower than Anker’s.

The Cuktech CP253L is a budget rival to the Anker 165W Power Bank and Baseus Free2Pull Power Bank, and indeed any of the 20K laptop power banks reviewed here. It wins points for its built-in USB-C cable, although at 6 inches (15cm) the cable not as long or handy as the 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable cable on the Baseus.
It is also a less powerful: 45W vs 60W via USB-C, and charges itself slower, too. It recharged our test MacBook Pro to 75%, again a little off the Baseus performance but probably enough for most users in need of a power boost. At 45W it’s fine for the MacBook Air but a little underpowered for the Pro MacBooks, which will charge a little slower.
(We’re only interested in Apple’s MacBook here but if you also own a Xiaomi laptop, its USB-C connectors can charge at 55W and the USB-A supports 33W UFCS charging for some Chinese phones.)
Who should buy the Cuktech CP253L 20K Power Bank?
The lower power input and output plus shorter cable, along with a slightly heavier weight, are compromises you may well overlook when you see the price. This is a great-looking—in either black or a cool white—and solidly performing portable battery pack for your laptop. It’s also available in the U.K. unlike the Baseus.

This is another column-shaped laptop power bank with a high-capacity. The three top-mounted USB ports support PD 3.1 so it is particularly useful for owners of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which can be fast-charged using one of this power bank’s 140W ports. As total power output is also 140W, you can’t charge another device at the same time as fast-charging that top-end MacBook. If you want to simultaneously charge more devices, look for a power bank with a higher maximum power output. The similarly designed Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, can use all three of its ports up to 250W. The Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank, also reviewed previously, is a larger unit but can reach 300W total power output.
The Alogic Ark has a smart display screen that shows you how fast devices are charging, remaining battery capacity, and how long it will keep charging at the current speed.
Who should buy the Alogic Ark 27K Power Bank?]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[Rumor: Apple to Announce Multiple New Products in First Week of March]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-announcements-first-week-of-march/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple on Monday invited selected journalists and content creators to a "special Apple Experience" on Wednesday, March 4 in New York, London, and Shanghai. And now, rumors are surfacing about Apple's broader plans for that week. Daring Fireball's John Gruber today guessed that Apple will announce new products on a day-by-day basis from Monday, March 2 through Wednesday, March 4:
What strikes me is that March 4 — the "experience" day — is a Wednesday. So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the "experience" will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos.
In response to Gruber's post, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said product announcements on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of that week is indeed "exactly" what he is expecting, based on what he has heard from his sources. Gurman does not expect a typical Apple Event live stream for the new products, with the announcements likely to occur in the form of press releases on the Apple Newsroom website instead. However, there could still be a short video prepared for each new product, and the media would get hands-on time with the new products. Apple has announced new products on a Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday basis multiple times in the past, including in March 2019 (new iPad mini and iPad Air, iMac, and AirPods models) and in October 2024 (new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models). Lower-Cost MacBook: A18 Pro chip, 12.9-inch display, and fun color options. iPhone 17e: A spec-bumped successor to the iPhone 16e, with rumored upgrades including an A19 chip, MagSafe, and Apple's C1X and N1 wireless chips. The device will apparently have a notch despite earlier rumors mentioning a Dynamic Island, and pricing will continue to start at $599 in the United States. iPad Air: M3 chip → M4 chip. iPad: A16 chip → A18 chip or A19 chip. MacBook Air: M4 chip → M5 chip. MacBook Pro: M4 Pro and M4 Max chips → M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, and PCIe 5.0 support for faster SSD speeds. Mac Studio: M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips → M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips. Studio Display: 27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting, up to 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and either an A19 chip or A19 Pro chip. Home Hub: An all-new smart home hub featuring the more personalized version of Siri, a 6-inch to 7-inch square display, an A18 chip for Apple Intelligence, FaceTime, and more. Place it on a table or mount it on a wall. Security Camera: Apple-designed, HomeKit-enabled security camera accessory to be sold alongside the new smart home hub.
In addition, rumors about new Apple TV and HomePod mini models have been circulating for more than a year, but there is still no sign of them. In the end, we might only get three of these new products in the first week of March, with the most likely possibilities being the lower-cost MacBook with an iPhone chip, the iPhone 17e, and perhaps either an updated iPad Air or entry-level iPad. tested those three colors plus pink for the MacBook with an iPhone chip. MacRumors will be attending the "Apple Experience," so stay tuned for our coverage.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-beta-tidbits/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[There is a long list of new features in the iOS 26.4 beta, many of which we highlighted yesterday, but we've since discovered several other smaller changes that Apple made in the software. Health App iOS 26.4 includes a new Average Bedtime metric for the sleep section of the Health app, providing a better idea of how bedtime can impact sleep quality. iOS 26, there was a section for the blood oxygen level, but the graph did not include a blood oxygen measurement. Camera In the Settings section of the Camera app, there is a new "Audio Zoom" option. The feature causes recorded audio to focus on the subject when the camera is zoomed while recording a video. It can be turned on or off, depending on the audio settings you prefer. CarPlay We found mentions of Apple TV support for CarPlay, indicating that Apple will eventually allow users to watch Apple TV content through their car's dashboard when the vehicle is not in motion. would add support for AirPlaying video content to a CarPlay display, and it appears that feature could come in the near future. Apple Music A song can be added to multiple playlists at the same time in the Apple Music app. In the add to playlist interface, there is a list button, and tapping it allows you to select multiple playlists at the same time. Hotspot Data Apple moved the location of hotspot data usage. Rather than having data usage metrics tucked away under Cellular, you'll see how much data you've used right in the Personal Hotspot section. Live Captions Chinese (Taiwan) is a new language option for Live Captions in the Accessibility section. Passcode Settings In the Face ID and Passcode section of the Settings app, when you enter a passcode to access your options, the text is now center aligned instead of left aligned. Shortcuts Apple added a Set Charge Limit action to the Shortcuts app. It sets a battery charge limit for the iPhone. For more on all of the new features in iOS 26.4, we have a dedicated iOS 26.4 features guide.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/toyota-apple-wallet-car-keys/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In 2020, Apple added a digital car key feature to its Wallet app, allowing users to lock, unlock, and start a compatible vehicle with an iPhone or Apple Watch. The feature is currently offered by select automakers, such as Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Genesis, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo, and Toyota is now rolling out support as well. According to a Reddit post, select trims of the 2026 Toyota RAV4 support the Apple Wallet car key feature in the United States, at a minimum. We have yet to confirm if the feature is rolling out to any of Toyota's other 2026 model year vehicles. Toyota's implementation of the feature utilizes Ultra Wideband technology, allowing you to simply approach the vehicle, open the door, and start the vehicle, all with your iPhone in your pocket or your Apple Watch on your wrist. This passive entry functionality requires an iPhone 11 or newer* or an Apple Watch Series 6 or newer. MacRumors was first to report that Toyota was planning to offer Apple Wallet car keys, so this rollout was expected. It appears that the feature requires a Toyota Remote Connect subscription, which starts at $15 per month. A free one-year Remote Connect trial is included with the purchase of a new Toyota vehicle. list of vehicle models that support iPhone car keys, but it is updated infrequently, so it is currently missing some newer additions. * Excluding the iPhone SE 2, iPhone SE 3, and iPhone 16e.

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-average-bedtime-vitals-blood-oxygen/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In iOS 26.4, Apple added an Average Bedtime metric to the Sleep section of the Health app, letting users better monitor how bedtime impacts sleep quality. Under a new Sleep Highlight, Apple lists the time that you went to bed and the time that you usually go to bed based on averages over a two-week period. In iOS 26.3, Apple displayed average sleep time over the past seven days. That highlight still exists, but it is now supplemented with the daily bedtime readout. iOS 26, there was a section for the blood oxygen level, but the graph did not include a blood oxygen measurement. Blood oxygen was available as a separate metric in the Vitals section, but it is now visible in the Vitals overview. The Vitals feature did not fully support blood oxygen because of Apple's ongoing legal dispute with Masimo. Masimo accused Apple of infringing on Masimo patents related to blood oxygen sensing, and it secured an import ban from the U.S. International Trade Commission. in early 2024 to be able to continue to sell the Apple Watch in the U.S., but Apple was able to re-add it in August 2025 with blood oxygen readouts available only on the iPhone. There is still no option to measure blood oxygen with the Apple Watch and see the results directly on the wrist in the U.S. Related Roundups: iOS 26, iPadOS 26

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/tvos-26-4-itunes-movies-tv-shows-removed/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[With tvOS 26.4, Apple has removed the dedicated iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Shows apps that listed content available for purchase. Buying movies and TV shows can be done through the Apple TV app instead. Apple started phasing out the iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Shows apps back in 2023, redirecting users to the ‌Apple TV‌ app for purchases. The apps remained available until now to provide customers with instructions on where to find their content, and to provide access to the iTunes Wish List. iPhone and iPad TV app with the launch of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2, and eliminated iTunes wishlists in those updates. tvOS 17.2 also got rid of wish lists. After customer complaints, wishlist options were returned, but Apple again started warning about the end of wishlists last week. Customers that still have an iTunes Wish List with movies and TV shows have received emails letting them know the feature is being removed. The emails include links to migrate those lists to the ‌Apple TV‌ watchlist feature as an alternative. Apple has been working to consolidate all movie and TV show viewing and buying to the TV app, so it's all in one place. There is no longer any iTunes-related app on the ‌Apple TV‌, but the ‌iPhone‌ still has an iTunes Store option for purchasing music. Apple has also updated the ‌Apple TV‌ Audio Format settings in tvOS 26.4. Dolby Atmos immersive audio has been replaced with Spatial Audio, and there is an option to convert to Dolby Digital 5.1, select Stereo Only, or turn on Auto mode. There's also a Continuous Audio Connection option for HDMI output. tvOS 26.4 is available to developers and public beta testers at the current time, with a release planned for spring.

      <title><![CDATA[Apple Working on Three AI Wearables: Smart Glasses, AI Pin, and AirPods With Cameras]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/apple-ai-wearable-development/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Apple is speeding up its work on three AI wearable devices, reports Bloomberg. Apple is developing AI smart glasses, a wearable AI pin or pendant, and AI AirPods, all of which will connect to the iPhone and will interface with the smarter version of Siri that's in the works. Cameras will be integrated into all three products to allow the AI to "see" around the wearer and answer questions about the wearer's surroundings. Smart Glasses Apple's smart glasses will compete with the Meta Ray-Bans, as previously rumored. Apple recently provided its hardware engineering team with prototypes, and it is targeting a 2027 launch. Production on the glasses could begin as soon as December 2026. Cameras: Apple's smart glasses will have an advanced camera system with a high-resolution camera that's able to capture photos and videos, as well as a second camera that provides visual information to ‌Siri‌ and environmental context. The second camera will be able to interpret the user's surroundings and measure distance, similar to LiDAR on the ‌iPhone‌. Apple wants to make its glasses stand out from Meta's with a higher-end camera. No display: Apple's AI glasses will not include a display in the lens. Voice-based interface: Users will be able to ask ‌Siri‌ questions and take actions with voice commands. Capabilities: The AI glasses will support interacting with ‌Siri‌, making phone calls, listening to music, taking photos, and capturing video. Users will be able to look at an object and ask questions about it and get detailed navigation directions when walking. The glasses could have a version of Visual Intelligence, able to read physical text like event dates and then add that information to the calendar. Context-aware reminders are a possibility, as is live translation. Build quality: Apple is focusing on build quality as a way to differentiate the Apple Glasses from Meta's Ray-Bans. Apple considered partnering with an existing glasses brand and tested embedding hardware in off-the-shelf frames, but it has decided to develop its own frames in-house. Apple is using high-end materials "including acrylic elements" for a "premium feel." Design options: The Apple glasses will come in multiple sizes and colors. More styles could come over time. Embedded battery: The latest prototypes have a battery and all components embedded in the frame, and Apple is aiming for the glasses to serve as an all-day AI companion. AI Pin Apple's work on the AI pin is apparently in the early stages, and it's possible that it could still be canceled. If work continues, the AI pin could launch as soon as 2027. Cameras: The AI pin will have a lower-resolution camera to provide the AI with visual insight, but it won't be able to take photos or videos. The camera is always-on, recording what's around the wearer. Microphone: There is an included microphone for speaking with ‌Siri‌. Bloomberg says some Apple employees think of the AI pin as the "eyes and ears" of the ‌iPhone‌. iPhone accessory: Apple plans to market the AI pin as an ‌iPhone‌ accessory and not a standalone product. Dedicated chip: There is a dedicated chip in the AI pin, but it is similar to an AirPods chip and not very powerful. The ‌iPhone‌ will handle most of the processing. Speaker: The pin could include a speaker for back-and-forth conversations with ‌Siri‌, but Apple has not decided whether to add this functionality. Clip or pendant: The AI pin could attach to a shirt or a bag with a clip, and there's also a hole in the pin that can be used to attach it to a necklace. AirPods There have been multiple reports of Apple's work on AirPods with cameras, and development is at a later stage than the AI pin. AirPods with cameras are planned for as early as this year. Like the AI pin, the AirPods will have a low-resolution camera that's designed for information, not for photo capture. Siri Though ‌Siri‌ has been delayed and new Apple Intelligence features did not come in the first beta of iOS 26.4, Apple is still working on a chatbot version of ‌Siri‌ for iOS 27. The chatbot version of ‌Siri‌ will rely on Google-developed AI models. Future Devices In the future, Apple is planning to develop smart glasses with an augmented reality display, but that device is several years away. HomePod in the works, and a "compact indoor sensor for home security and automation."

      <title><![CDATA[How to tell if your Mac has been hacked – Key signs &amp; what to do]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/676307/how-to-know-if-your-mac-has-been-hacked.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld It’s a long-held belief of Mac users that their computers are immune to the kind of malware and viruses that plague Windows PCs. While there is some credibility in this idea, we shouldn’t get over-confident when it comes to Mac security, as there are exploits that criminals can use to hack your Mac and leave it like a wide-open door through which they can steal your data or worse. In this article, we take a look at whether Macs can be hacked, how to tell if your Mac has been hacked or if someone is spying on your Mac, and what you can do if your Mac is being remotely accessed. Here’s what you need to know – and what you need to do. Signs your Mac has been hacked: At a glance symptom checklist
First some reassurance: you probably haven’t been hacked. It’s more likely that you are dealing with buggy macOS behavior or app related problems. Unfortunately sometimes a macOS update can cause your Mac to start behaving in a strange way, Spotlight indexing, or a kernal-task related to temperature control can cause high CPU usage, as we have found on many occasions.
But sometimes the behaviour really is suspicious. The things to look out for include: Mac running really hot, very slow, and the fans very loud when idle. Browser-based hijacks, a change to your usual Home Page, redirects, extensions you didn’t install, and suspicious pop-ups – especially if they say ‘Your Mac is infected’.
Apps you didn’t install, or don’t remember installing. Excessive use of CPU in Activity Monitor. If none of the above apply, your Mac is unlikely to have been hacked. If you are still concerned, read on for details of how to run the checks to confirm whether your Mac has been hacked. PROMOTION
Protect Your Mac: Intego Mac Premium Bundle Intego Mac Internet Security X9 offers a useful set of security utilities that help keep your Mac safe and running smoothly and its user-friendly interface is right at home with Apple’s macOS aesthetic. It’s Macworld’s Editors Choice.
Now $29.99 (down from $84.99) for the first year. Get Deal What to do if your Mac has been hacked If you are convinced you have been hacked, then we recommend you do the following: Disconnect Wi-Fi.
Change important passwords using a different device – including your Apple ID.
Look for any unknown devices associated with your Apple ID and remove any that are suspicious. Check for unknown admin accounts, login items, remote access settings, and configuration profiles (we offer details on how to do this below).
Backup your files carefully (you don’t want your backup to be infected with malware). Run a Mac antivirus. Update macOS if there are any macOS updates that should be applied. Run a clean install of macOS if you are sure you were compromised. Enable FileVault and Firewall on your Mac if it’s not already turned on. Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry How to tell if Mac is hacked
If you think your Mac has been hacked there are a few ways to find out. First, look for the signs: Has your Mac slowed down? Is your web connection painfully slow? Do the ads you are seeing look a bit more dodgy than usual? Have you noticed anything strange on your bank statements? If you fear your Mac may have been hacked, here are some quick things you can do to check for signs your Mac has been compromised: 1.
Check System Settings Check to see if a new admin account has appeared. Foundry In System Settings you can look for signs that your Mac has been accessed by someone other than yourself. Open System Settings. Go to Users &amp; Groups to see if a new admin account has been added. Make sure your own account type hasn’t changed. Look for unknown login item in System Settings &gt; General &gt; Login Items &amp; Extensions. Are there any apps set to launch at startup that you didn’t install? Are there any suspicious apps that have been given permission for App Background Activity that you were unaware of? Check for any extensions you don’t remember installing in the Extension section. Go to System Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security and check Remote Desktop to see if any applications have requested access. Look our for unexpected screen sharing or remote access enabled. Check your remote access settings. In Privacy &amp; Security check to see if anything has been granted Full Disk Access. Also in Privacy &amp; Security check for any Profiles that you didn’t install (you may not see anything, which is nothing to worry about). Go to System Settings &gt; General &gt; Sharing and check Screen Sharing, Remote Login, Remote Management and File Sharing to see if they have been enabled without your knowledge. 2.
Check Activity Monitor We checked: OfficeThumbnailExtension relates to QuickLook on the Mac and doesn’t seem to be malicious, just annoying! Foundry Activity monitor is a great way to check for errant processes that are running on your Mac. One of these processes may be what is causing the symptoms that have made you concerned about your Mac, although it doesn’t necessarily mean you have been compromised. To check for suspicious processes running on your Mac open Activity Monitor. Click on View &gt; All Processes. Click on the CPU tab.
Sort by % CPU.
Note any apps or processes using more than 50% of your CPU while your Mac is idle. High CPUs are normally associated with browsers, video apps and games, anything else would be unusual. Look for any apps or processes you don’t recognise
If you see something that looks suspicious Google the process name (but it’s probably nothing to worry about and may be vital for your Mac). Next, click on the Network tab.
Sort by sent bytes.
Note anything that is sending large amounts of data when you are not uploading anything. Be suspicious of anything sending large amounts of data out, but Google unknown process names before deleting/quitting any processes. Now check Memory usage in Activity Monitor by clicking on the Memory tab. Look out for apps consuming a lot of RAM. Look for evidence of remote access, e.g. processes like: screensharingd, ARDAgent, sshd, remoted, and tools like TeamViewer. 3.
Look for suspicious apps Nothing suspicious looking, but beware of duplicate apps that could be spoofs. Foundry Have a look for any apps you don’t remember installing. Open the Finder. Go to the Applications folder. Sort by Date Added (if this isn’t an option right click on the bar and choose Date Added). Look for any apps you don’t recognise or don’t remember installing. 4.
Check Browser Extensions Check Chrome and Safari to see if there are any Extensions you don’t remember installing. Foundry Browser hijacks are possible even if your whole system isn’t hacked, so be sure to check Safari, Chrome, FireFox and any other browser you use. Look for extensions you don’t remember installing, and delete them. In Safari click on Safari &gt; Extensions. In Crome click on Chrome &gt; Settings &gt; Extensions. 5.
Scan your Mac with an antivirus solution Run a Mac Antivirus solution and scan to see if there is any malware on your Mac. Foundry macOS will automatically scan your Mac for any malware definitions that features in XProtect, but you can’t force it to do this. Therefore we strongly recommend that you run a Mac virus scan using a third party security app. Initiating a virus scan is an easy process that usually begins with the user clicking a Scan or Smart Scan button.
There are various Mac Antivirus apps we recommend, our top choice for Mac users being Intego, but there are lots of options, including some free Antivirus apps. See: Best Mac Antivirus software for the best options. to read our guide on how to remove a virus from a Mac. 6.
Check your password Screenshot Foundry If you think an account might have been hacked then check the website haveibeenpwned.com and pop in your email address to see if it’s featured in a data breach. If it has been then change your password! This doesn’t mean you have been hacked, but it’s certainly possible that if this information is out there you could be. How to protect your Mac from hackers
macOS is a very secure system, so there’s no need to panic, but if you want to reduce the chances of being compromised then there are a few things to do.
The first is to only download software from either the Mac App Store or the official websites of manufacturers.
You should also avoid clicking on links in emails in case they lead you to spoof websites and malware. Don’t use USB cables, other cables, or memory sticks, that if you can’t be sure that they are safe.
When you are browsing the web surf in private or incognito mode.
If you ever receive a ransomware request or a phishing email do not respond as all this does is confirm that you exist.
Another is to make sure you download updates to macOS as soon as they become available as they usually include security patches. In fact, you can set up your Mac to automatically download such updates. Turn on Automatic Updates in System Settings &gt; Software Update, click on the i beside Automatic Updates and select all the options. Pre-Ventura, go to System Preferences &gt; Software Update and click beside Automatically keep my Mac up to date pre-Ventura.
Finally, consider using a dedicated security software package. You’ll find our pick of the current offerings in best Mac antivirus. Right now our top choices are Intego Mac Internet Security, but we also like McAfee Total Protection, and Norton 360 Deluxe.
You should also consider using a password manager, as this will allow you to have multiple, complicated login details across all your accounts without having to remember them. Here our recommendations are LastPass, 1Password, and NordPass. Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry FAQ 1.
Can Macs get hacked?
It may be rare when compared to Windows, but yes, there have been cases where Macs have been accessed by hackers.
These kinds of attack aren’t likely to affect the general public though, so if you aren’t protecting state secrets or heavily invested in cryptocurrency you are unlikely to fall fowl of such an attack. 2.
What are some examples of Macs being hacked
There are various types of Mac malware that have been discovered ‘in the wild’ on Macs as you can see from our run-through of the various threats affecting macOS: List of Mac viruses, malware and security flaws. Soon after launch, Malware targeted the M1 Mac – read about Silver Sparrow and the first cases of malware for M1 Macs.
In August 2023 a software developer released details about a flaw in App Management, a security feature introduced in macOS Ventura designed to prevent malicious software modifications and alerting the user in such an instance. The developer had discovered the issue before the release of Ventura in October 2022, but a fix was not immediately issued, so, in August 2023, the developer went public with details of the flaw which meant that apps could bypass the check by App Management. More here.
In December 2023, a group of university researchers alerted Apple to a vulnerability in Apple’s M-series chips that can be exploited to gain access to cryptographic keys. Dubbed “GoFetch,” the vulnerability could be used by an attacker to access a user’s encrypted files. In April 2024 Apple alerted some users via an email, suggesting that they may have been the target of spyware. “Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-,” read the email, as detailed here: Apple warns users in 92 countries of spyware attack.
It’s not always a flaw in Apple’s software that can leave Macs vulnerable. In August 2023 a serious vulnerability that affected Intel processors was highlighted. Affected devices included Intel-powered Macs from 2015 onwards (M-series Macs were all ok). According to researcher Daniel Moghimi: “Downfall attacks target a critical weakness found in billions of modern processors used in personal and cloud computers.” Intel released a patch, but it’s not the first time this has happened. Back in 2018, in a similar case, Meltdown and Spectre attacked vulnerabilities in Intel and ARM processors. That risk was mitigated by updates to the operating system which closed off the areas that were exposed.
Such vulnerabilities, though rare, could allow an attacker root access to your Mac. 3.
What does Apple do about hacks
Apple has gone to great lengths to make it difficult for hackers to gain access to Macs. With the protections offered by Gatekeeper, the Secure Enclave features of the M-series of chips, and the T1 or T2 chip in some Intel-powered Macs, plus Apple’s built-in antivirus XProtect, targeting Macs may well be considered too much effort by hackers. We discuss this in more detail here: How secure is a Mac? and in Do Macs need antivirus software?
However, from time to time security vulnerabilities are detected that could be used by hackers to exploit Macs. These vulnerabilities are sometimes referred to as back doors or as a zero-day vulnerability. When these are identified by security researchers (or friendly hackers) they usually alert Apple to them in the hope that the company will quickly close the vulnerability, quickly – or within zero days – before it is exploited. Apple encourages researchers to point out vulnerabilities, and when a vulnerability is discovered, Apple is usually quick to fix. Apple has even paid money to those who brought security flaws to its attention. For example, in 2021, Apple paid a student $100,000 after he discovered a dangerous vulnerability relating to Macs and reported it to Apple. The vulnerability, which could enable a hacker to gain control of a Mac user’s camera, was identified by Ryan Pickren in July 2021 and fixed by Apple in macOS Monterey 12.0.1 on October 25, 2021. More information here: Hacker ‘could take over any Apple webcam’.
But there have been cases where Apple has been criticized for being slow to respond to the threat once it’s been identified. For example, researcher Filippo Cavallarin found a Gatekeeper vulnerability in 2019 that he alerted Apple to. Having had no response from Apple within 90 days he went public with details of the vulnerability. 4.
How does Apple protect Macs from hackers
Apple is kept busy patching these security flaws as and when they arise, but it used to be reliant on users to install them. Before Apple launched macOS Ventura in 2022 an update to the operating system was required to get the important security component on a Mac. Since some people delay installing operating system updates this was problematic so Apple changed the way security updates are applied to Macs. These important security updates can now be delivered as background updates that can be automatically installed on a Mac without the user having to do anything – although we recommend you check the following to ensure it is set up on your Mac:
Open System Settings. Choose General. Click on the i beside Automatic Updates. Make sure that the option to Install Security Responses and system files is selected, even if you choose not to select the others (although we recommend you do).
Now your Mac will check for updates, download the update, and install the update without you needing to do anything. If you aren’t running a recent version of macOS then Apple won’t be issuing any security updates for you. Apple only issues security updates for the current three versions of macOS, see: How long does Apple support Macs for. For that reason we recommend that you have a Mac that supports at least the version of macOS from two years ago. Currenly only macOS Tahoe, which launched in fall 2025, macOS Sequoia and macOS Sonoma are supported with security updates. Luckily this does mean most Macs from 2018 and later are supported. Read: The latest version of macOS your Mac can run. 5.
Can a Mac camera be hacked?
Once a hacker has access to your Mac there are various ways in which they might try to gain information about you or use the processing power of your Mac for their own purposes. As we mentioned above, in the case of spyware the hacker might attempt to install a keylogger so that it can record what you are typing and look out for your password. The hacker could also attempt to hijack your mic or video camera.
Theoretically, this shouldn’t be possible: since macOS Catalina launched in 2019 Apple has protected Mac users from these types of exploits by ensuring that you have to give your permission before the mic or video camera is used, or before a screen recording can take place. And if your video camera is being used you will always see a green light next to it. However, the example we mentioned above, where Ryan Pickren alerted Apple to a vulnerability that could enable a hacker to gain control of a Mac user’s camera, suggests that Apple’s alert wasn’t enough to stop the camera from being accessed. There was also a camera-related vulnerability that affected Mac users of the video conferencing service Zoom. In this case, hackers could add users to video calls without them knowing and then activate their webcams but keep the light turned off. This would enable any potential hackers (or law enforcement bodies) to monitor your activities and you wouldn’t have any idea that the camera was watching you. Zoom patched the vulnerability, but only after it became public knowledge when the person who found it reported that the flaw had been left in place for three months after the company had been privately informed of the risk.

We’ll run through the types of hacks that are more pertinent to the hacking of Macs below:
Cryptojacking: This is where someone uses your Mac’s processor and RAM to mine cryptocurrency. If your Mac has slowed right down this could be the culprit.
Spyware: Here hackers attempt to gather sensitive data about you, such as your log in details. They might use key loggers to record what you type and eventually have the information they need to log in to your accounts. In one example, the OSX/OpinionSpy spyware was stealing data from infected Macs and selling it on the dark web.
Ransomware: Some criminals use Ransomware to try and extort money from you. In cases like KeRanger hackers could have encrypted files on Macs and then demand money to unencrypt them. Luckily Security researchers identified KeRanger before it started infecting Macs so it was addressed before it became a serious threat. In April 2023 security researchers warned that a collective known as LockBit was working on ransomware encryptors that work on both Macs using Apple M-series chips and Intel processors.
Botnet: In this case, your computer becomes a remotely operated spam machine. In the case of the Trojan Horse botnet OSX.FlashBack over 600,000 Mac computers.
Proof-of-concept: Sometimes the threat isn’t actually seen in the wild, but is a proof of concept based on a loophole or vulnerability in Apple’s code. While this is less of a threat the concern is that if Apple isn’t quick enough to close the vulnerability it could be utilized by criminals. In one example Google’s Project Zero team designed a proof-of-concept known as Buggy Cos which was able to gain access to parts of macOS thanks to a bug in macOS’ memory manager.
Port exploits: It’s not always the case that the hack is made possible by some sort of malware downloaded onto the Mac. In some cases, Macs have been hacked after something is plugged into a port. It is possible that Macs could be hacked via the USB and by the Thunderbolt port – which is a good reason to always be careful about what you plug into your Mac or leave your Mac unattended. For example, in the checkm8 exploit it could have been possible for hackers to gain access to the T2 chip by plugging in a modified USB-C cable. Similarly, in the case of Thunderspy a serious vulnerability with the Thunderbolt port could have granted a hacker access to a Mac.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Expectations are high that Apple is planning a number of new product releases in the spring 2026 time frame, including the iPhone 17e and new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models, but will the company hold a spring event, and if it does, when will Apple’s spring event take place? With Apple sending out invites to select journalists for March 4, it certainly looks like something will be launching soon, but it’s less clear if this will be at a live-streamed event since the invitations are to an ‘experience’ rather than an event. In this article, we explain what you need to know about Apple’s rumored spring event, including the expected timing, how to watch it, and what Apple might launch. Will Apple hold a spring event in 2026? Apple’s spring event in 2026 is more of an ‘Experience’.
Apple Apple is hosting ‘Special Experiences’ on March 4 in London, New York and Shanghai. The 4 March experiences may not translate to an Apple Event, but a number of new products are thought to be coming in the spring timeframe and we could see these launch in conjunction. Apple has issued invites to a ‘Special Apple Experience’ in at least three locations (U.S., U.K. and China) on Wednesday, March 4, 2026. While Apple often unveils new products at a live-streamed event, in recent years it has been doing so less frequently, for example, in spring 2025 we saw a series of event-free Apple launches: the iPhone 16e debuted on February 19, followed by updated iPad and iPad Air models announced via press release on March 4. A day later, Apple introduced the M4 MacBook Air and Mac Studio in a separate announcement.
Even if Apple chooses to keep these ‘experiences’ behind doors – rather than holding a live-streamed event – it appears that there will be hands-on sessions, which suggests that there will be new products.
For more detail on Apple’s calendar of events, read When is the next Apple event? When is the Spring Apple event 2026?
Wednesday, March 4, 2026: ‘Apple Special Experience’ confirmed.
Apple has invited some members of the press to a ‘Special Apple Experience’ on March 4.
The timing of this March 4 ‘experience’ coincides with Mobile World Congress – running from March 2-5, 2026. Various major phones launched at MWC in 2025, including Samsung’s Galaxy A series (A26, A36, A56) featuring Galaxy AI. Even before Apple announced the ‘experiences’ on March 4, we had suggested that if Apple wants to steal the show with the iPhone 17e launch, it could do it that week. What time will Apple’s spring event start?
The 4 March ‘experience’ is set to start at the same time in the three locations Apple is holding it at: New York: 9am
London: 2pm
Shanghai: 10pm What will Apple launch in spring 2026?
There are plenty of rumors suggesting that new Apple products are in the pipeline. iPhone update Foundry | Alex Walker-Todd There is said to be an iPhone 17e, an update to the iPhone 16e and a value-oriented alternative to the iPhone 17, coming this spring. here: iPhone 17e: Everything you need to know.
iPad updates
A refreshed iPad Air featuring the M4 chip is expected to launch early in the year.
A new entry-level iPad equipped with the A19 chip is also predicted for the spring lineup.
MacBook updates MacBook Air and MacBook Pro updates are coming soon. Foundry While the entry-level M5 MacBook Pro launched in late 2025, the more powerful MacBook Pro M5 Pro and M5 Max configurations are expected to arrive in spring 2026. here: MacBook Pro M5 Pro &amp; Max release date – Where are the Pro MacBooks?
A new MacBook Air powered by the M5 chip is also slated to launch this spring. here: M5 MacBook Air: Everything you need to know before it launches.
There are also rumors that Apple will launch a low cost MacBook.
Home and AI
Apple is reportedly developing a smart home hub with a built-in screen, often referred to as the “HomePad“.
The spring of 2026 is expected to be a turning point for Apple’s software ecosystem, specifically regarding its voice assistant, however, AI updates to Siri are said to be delayed (again). How to watch Apple’s spring event Apple The best way to watch an Apple event – if there is one – would be to get an invite to attend in person, but most of us won’t be so lucky. Fortunately, Apple will also live stream the presentation so everyone can watch along.
The first place to try is right at the top of this article where we will have embedded Apple’s YouTube stream. You can also watch on Apple’s events page, which will have the live stream on the night. Indeed, the main Apple.com home page usually shows the presentation while it is happening.
If you’ve got an iPhone, an iPad, an Apple TV, or a Mac–assuming the device has sufficiently up-to-date software–you can watch the stream on the TV app. PC owners can also watch, but will need to visit Apple’s site as mentioned above.
After the event is finished, it will also be available to rewatch in the Podcasts and TV apps, and on Apple’s website.
Finally, Apple has for certain events in the past held broadcast events in Apple Stores, so it may be worth contacting your nearest outlet to see if they have anything planned.
More information about watching the event here: How to watch Apple’s event. When were Apple’s past spring events held
Apple previously held a Spring event on the following dates:
2025: no event
2024: Tuesday May 7: (“Let Loose“): 11 &amp; 14-inch iPad Pro M4, 11 &amp; 14-inch iPad Air M2, Apple Pencil Pro
2023: no event
2022, Tuesday March 8: (“Peek Performance,” virtual): New iPhone SE, new iPad Air, Mac Studio and Studio Display, and new iPhone color options
2021, Tuesday April 20: (“Spring Loaded,” virtual): New iPad Pro and iMac, Apple TV 4K, AirTags, new iPhone color options and iOS 14.7
2020: no event
2019, Monday March 25: (“It’s show time“): Apple Card, and the News+, TV+, and Arcade subscription services
2018, Tuesday March 27: (“Let’s take a field trip“): New iPad and education announcements
2017: no event
2016, Monday March 21: (“Let us loop you in“): iPad Pro, iPhone SE, and software updates
2015, Monday March 9: (“Spring Forward“): Apple Watch, a new MacBook, and iOS 8.2
2014: no event
2013: no event
2012, Wednesday March 7: (“We have something you really have to see. And touch“): 3rd-gen Apple TV and 3rd-gen iPad Does Apple always hold a spring event? In spring 2025, there was a series of event-free Apple launches: the iPhone 16e debuted on February 19, followed by updated iPad and iPad Air models announced via press release on March 4. A day later, Apple introduced the M4 MacBook Air and Mac Studio in a separate announcement.
Traditionally Apple execs take to the stage to unveil new products. Apple has held six spring events over the past decade, with notable gaps in 2017, 2020, 2023, and 2025; Apple may well have held an event in 2020 if it wasn’t for the pandemic). Apple doesn’t always hold a spring event, but when it does, it usually takes place in March or April – with the exception of 2024, when Apple surprised us all by issuing invites to an event on May 7.
Will Apple once again roll out its spring products without an event, or will it return to a keynote-style presentation to maximise attention on new announcements? As we asked previously, is the era of the Apple event over? We hope not. Apple’s spring event is one of the three or four big events in Apple’s yearly cycle of announcements. There’s the big iPhone/Mac software announcements at WWDC in the summer, the iPhone launch in September, sometimes we see Apple make Mac and iPad announcements in October or November, and (some years) we get some hardware reveals at a spring event in March or April. At these events Apple executives hit the stage–whether real or virtual–and boast about some recent successes, before revealing what new products are about to launch. In recent years Apple has moved away from holding events to launch new products. It’s continued to hold a keynote to kick off WWDC in June and an event to celebrate the launch of a new iPhone in September, but the spring and late fall events have become less certain, but for not for any lack of product announcements. What has Apple launched in past spring events? You can still watch the spring 2024 event on YouTube. Here’s what Apple has announced at previous spring events:
2024: Tuesday May 7: New iPad Air (M2) and iPad Pro (M4) models. Updates to Magic keyboards for iPads and new Apple Pencil Pro. Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro updates. 2023: no event
2022, Tuesday March 8: (“Peek Performance,” virtual): New iPhone SE, new iPad Air, Mac Studio and Studio Display, and new iPhone color options
2021, Tuesday April 20: (“Spring Loaded,” virtual): New iPad Pro and iMac, Apple TV 4K, AirTags, new iPhone color options and iOS 14.7
2020: no event
2019, Monday March 25: (“It’s show time”): Apple Card, and the News+, TV+, and Arcade subscription services
2018, Tuesday March 27: (“Let’s take a field trip”): New iPad and education announcements
2017: no event
2016, Monday March 21: (“Let us loop you in”): iPad Pro, iPhone SE, and software updates
2015, Monday March 9: (“Spring Forward”): Apple Watch, a new MacBook, and iOS 8.2
2014: no event
2013: no event
2012, Wednesday March 7: (“We have something you really have to see. And touch”): 3rd-gen Apple TV and 3rd-gen iPad

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple and Google are preparing the latest versions of their entry-level smartphones. On February 18, the Pixel 10a will debut with a reworked Tensor G4 processor and support for a full year of OS updates. At around the same time, Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17e, featuring MagSafe compatibility and upgraded chips.
On the surface, both refreshes appear to be incremental. But a closer look at the rumored specifications suggests the Pixel 10a will still offer the stronger overall value for budget-conscious smartphone buyers. Not only will the iPhone 17e likely cost $100 more, but according to rumors, it’ll still miss out on several essential upgrades that have been standard on the budget Pixel line for a while.
Camera: Two is better than one
Photographers and content creators have long praised flagship iPhones for the exceptional camera systems they pack. Pro users get to pick between the ultra-wide, wide, and telephoto lenses, letting them shoot nearby and distant subjects alike. However, despite Apple’s undeniable interest in mobile photography, its efforts don’t translate as vividly beyond the flagship line.
When Apple introduced the iPhone SE with a single rear lens in 2020, the decision was arguably justified at the time due to the phone’s low cost. That’s no longer the case, however. The company now charges mid-range prices for its “e” iPhones, while still giving their cameras the budget phone treatment. The iPhone 17e won’t be cheap, and excluding a second rear lens makes little sense. The iPhone 17e will likely still have just one rear camera. David Price / Foundry Things get trickier for Apple when comparing the iPhone 17e to its primary rival—Google’s Pixel 10a. Budget Pixel phones have offered ultra-wide and wide rear cameras for a few years now, despite them costing significantly less than Apple’s “e” iPhones. If Google has done it, why can’t Apple?
Another Pixel 10a camera win is Google’s superior AI photography features. Those opting for Android will get to utilize exclusive photography perks, like Best Take, and apply advanced edits unavailable natively on iOS. And we don’t expect the iPhone 17e to introduce any new tricks that aren’t already on the iPhone 17.

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple holds several major product launch events each year, but the company rarely announces exact dates far in advance and there is no guarantee that an event will even be held in the usual time frame. That leaves Apple fans and those wanting to buy new Apple products wondering when the next Apple event will take place – and what new products can be expected.
Based on Apple’s long-established event schedule, recent announcements, and reliable industry rumours, we have made some educated guesses about when Apple’s next keynote is likely to happen and which new products are likely to headline it. In this article, we break down what we know so far, what Apple has confirmed, and what history tells us to expect next.
Apple’s event schedule for 2026
Spring Event: March 4 ‘special experience’ being held.
WWDC: June (expected)
iPhone Event: September (expected)
Late Fall Event: October/November (possible)
Apple doesn’t participate in big industry-wide events such as CES, IFA or E3. Apple holds its own events. Several times a year, Apple invites the press and industry professionals to Apple Park to hear all about its latest products and services. Apple calls these ‘events’ and it streams them live online to millions of watchers. There can be as many as four Apple events in a year, as outlined above. This event calendar is by no means set in stone, though, with the spring and October events being less regular. Some years, Apple doesn’t hold a spring event at all. In 2025 Apple only held two events preferring instead to announce new products via press release. In 2026 Apple is expected to hold at least three events, kicking off with a spring event. Apple has invited some members of the media to ‘experiences’ in various locations on March 4. While the invite describes a ‘Special Apple Experience’ rather than an Apple Event, it does fit the spring time frame and there are a number of anticipated launches, including the iPhone 17e and MacBook Pro M5 Pro and M5 Max, M5 MacBook Air and the rumored low-cost MacBook.
Then, in June, the company will hold the Worldwide Developers Conference at which it reveals plans for its operating systems. That event usually begins off with a keynote and (sometimes) new product launches. By the fall everyone will be waiting for Apple to launch the new iPhone 18, and that usually happens at an Apple event in September. The company may then hold a late fall event in October, as it has in some years. Read on to find out more about Apple’s 2026 events and what could launch. Here’s when the 2026 Apple events might take place. Foundry FAQ 1.
When is Apple’s next event?
Apple is widely expected to hold an event in the spring of 2026. Apple has issued invites to a ‘Special Apple Experience’ in at least three locations: New York, London, and Shanghai. The ‘Special Experience’ is scheduled to take place on March 4, at 9am ET. Apple has not confirmed that this is an Apple event in the usual format. So there may be no live broadcast to watch of Apple executives unveiling new products. It is possible that Apple could unveil a number of new products in the run up to the Special Experiences, with these ‘events’ being a chance for journalists to get a first look at the new products. 2.
What time will the next Apple event start?
This question is normally easy to answer, however, if the ‘Special Experience’ on March 4 is interpreted as an event then the start time is as follows: New York: 9am London: 2pm Shanghai: 10pm Apple keynotes usually start at 10 am PT/PST. That translates to the following times in the countries where most of our readers live:
U.S.: at 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), noon (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT)
Canada: as above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT)
U.K.: at 6 pm (GMT/BST)
Europe: at 7pm (CET/CEST), 8 pm (EET/EEST)
India: at 10.30 pm (IST)
Australia: Next day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT)
New Zealand: Next day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT)
Timings can be slightly different if Apple holds the event during the period of a couple of weeks when the clocks have changed in the U.S. but not elsewhere (in 2026 the clocks will change in the U.S. on March 8 and November 1, while in the U.K. they change on March 29 and October 25).
Sometimes Apple holds events at different times, for example, in October 2023 the event was held in late afternoon in San Francisco, which meant it was midnight in the U.K. If Apple doesn’t hold an event and instead just issues a press release that usually happens around 8 am PT, 11 am ET and 4 pm GMT/BST. 3.
How long does an Apple event last?
Apple keynotes usually last between one and two hours and feature CEO Tim Cook along with various other Apple executives. WWDC and the September event tend to be longer keynotes; the spring and late-fall events can be slightly shorter.
The September 2024 event was 1 hour 38 minutes. Apple’s Spring Event 2026, date and product launches Apple When is the spring event? March 4
We know that Apple is holding a ‘Special Experience’ on March 4. While this hasn’t been confirmed as an event, and its purpose isn’t clear, there are a number of new products expected to launch soon. The March 4 invites suggest that there may be an opportunity to ‘experience’ new products. What Apple could launch at the spring event
For the spring 2026 event we may see the M5 MacBook Air upgraded with the M5 chip and the MacBook Pro with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. There are also claims that Apple may be soon to launch a low-cost MacBook. Also expected is the iPhone 17e, plus an update to the entry-level iPad and M4 iPad Air. There may also be a new Mac mini.
We may also see a new Studio Display, with Apple rumored to be working on a new external Mac monitor with features like ProMotion and HDR, and the long rumored Smart Home hub alongside a new HomePod, and Apple TV.
For more information about Apple’s spring events read: Apple Spring event: Date, time, product launch rumors. Apple’s WWDC Event 2026, date and product launches Foundry When is the WWDC keynote?
Apple usually holds WWDC in the second week of June, in 2025 the keynote was on June 9, so in 2026 June 8 is likely. What Apple could launch at WWDC
WWDC is Apple’s big developer event at which it reveals plans for the operating systems that run on Apple hardware.
In June 2026 we expect Apple to unveil details of the iOS 27, iPadOS 27, a new macOS, updates to watchOS, tvOS, HomePod software, and an update to Apple’s realityOS.
Apple sometimes announces new hardware at WWDC, usually the high end models targeted at power users, so we could see new Macs.
This could include a new Mac Pro (the current model still utilizing the generations-old M2 Ultra chip). The Mac Studio could also get an update. Following the keynote on the Monday, developer events and sessions will run throughout the week. You can about WWDC date, times and everything you need to know in a separate article. Apple’s iPhone Event 2026, date and product launches Apple When is the iPhone event?
Apple’s iPhone launch event has become a regular fixture in September (aside from 2020 event when it was delayed until October – and the early January launches). In recent years the event has been held on September 9, so we could see Apple make the unveiling in the week of September 7 in 2026, with the event perhaps taking place on September 8 or 9. What will Apple launch at the September 2026 event?
We can be pretty confident that the iPhone 18 series will launch in late 2026, although there may be some changes to the line up: we may see the iPhone 18 Pro, Pro Max launch in September but the iPhone 18 may be held back until the spring of 2027. Alongside the new iPhone 18 Pro we may see new Apple Watches. In 2026 the Apple Watch Series 12 should get a chip update, since the Series 11 is using the same chip as the Series 10 did. The Apple Watch Ultra 4 is said to be getting a fingerprint scanner. The only AirPods not to have been updated in recent times is the five-years-old AirPods Max, if Apple doesn’t update these before or during the September event it will probably be concluded that the company has lost interest in that product. Find out more about the September iPhone event in our dedicated article. Apple’s late fall Event 2026, date and product launches Apple Will there be a late fall event in 2026
The last time Apple held a late fall event was October 30, 2023, and before that October 18, 2021. So a late fall event isn’t unprecedented, but it is uncommon. Right now there is no way of knowing if Apple will hold a late fall event in 2026, or indeed, if it ever will again. Usually this event is to launch consumer Macs, but in recent years Apple hasn’t felt the need to hold an event to do that. Nearer the time we will know if there are big things planned that might warrant an event. What will Apple launch at the late fall 2026 event?
Mac or iPad launches are most likely for an event in this time frame, but Apple hasn’t seen the need to hold an event to launch Macs since the Scary Fast event in 2023 when Apple introduced the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max in the MacBook Pro. As for iPads, the last time Apple featured an iPad launch at an event was in May 2024, so slightly more recent than Macs, but the new iPads could arrive at the spring event in 2026 meaning there would be no iPad news in the pipeline by the fall. For more information about Apple’s late fall events read: Apple’s October Event: Date, time and what will launch. What launched at Apple’s past events In 2025 Apple only held two events. The first was its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 9, at which it introduced the new features coming in the next version of its operating systems, and the second was the huge September 9 Apple Event where it launched new Apple Watches, new AirPods Pro and the new iPhones for 2025.
Apple doesn’t have to hold an event to launch new products though. Prior to WWDC, Apple launched a new iPhone 16e via press release on February 19, a new iPad and iPad Air via press release on March 4, and a new MacBook Air and Mac Studio on March 5. Apple then went on to launch a new M5 MacBook Pro and M5 iPad Pro in October. No event was held to mark these launches.
In 2024, Apple held three events: one on Tuesday, May 7, at which it launched new iPads, a keynote to kick off WWDC on June 10, and an event on September 9 at which Apple unveiled the new iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10 and the AirPods 4. In October 2024 there was no event, but Apple did announce new products (iMac, Mac mini and MacBook Pro) via press release.
In 2023 there were three events: WWDC in June, an iPhone event in September, and Apple’s second fall event on October 30 (or after midnight on October 31 if you weren’t in the U.S.).
In 2022 Apple held three events: a spring event on March 8, WWDC on June 6, and the iPhone 14 launch on September 7. In other years Apple has held four events though. Foundry When were Apple’s past events? Spring Apple events have been held on the following dates:

      <title><![CDATA[A colorful MacBook is coming to chase away the Siri doom]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3062620/coming-attractions-macbooks-ipads-and-no-apple-doom.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld It is mid-February 2026, and the Macalope is still writing “Where does the time go? All things fade. Soon we die.” on all his checks.
It’s a little game he likes to play with the Department of Licensing and Registration. The Macalope likes to imagine they love it.
Anyway, it’s high time we take a look at what’s coming up this year because before you know it, it’ll be over. Apple got the ball rolling yesterday when it announced an event for March 4th.
Wait. Excuse the Macalope. Not an “event”. An “experience.” An “event” is jejune. Basic. Lowbrow. An “experience” is elevated. Refined. Possibly confusing or even a little terrifying. The colors on the logo accompanying the announcement have convinced many that the rumored new colorful MacBook lineup will be announced.
Gurman floats several options, including yellow, light green, blue, and pink…
It remains to be seen if “light” here means a lighter shade of an actual color or more the vague concept of the idea of a thing remotely like a color that Apple tends to default to.
If a cheaper MacBook with a less powerful chip excites you, then you’ll love what else Apple is expected to ship soon! The iPhone 17e is expected imminently, adding an A19 chip and MagSafe charging, something the horny one did not realize the 16e did not have. A new base model iPad and iPad Air are expected early this year, but will just be speed bumps of the existing models.
One thing you should not be expecting any time soon is that enhanced version of Siri Apple keeps saying is “on schedule” and is “showing good progress” and is “thinking of taking a gap year to travel around Europe before deciding whether to go to college or enter the workforce”. Wait, what was that last one?
After planning to include the new capabilities in iOS 26.4…Apple is now working to spread them out over future versions…possibly postponing some features until at least iOS 26.5, due in May, and iOS 27, which comes out in September.
Mark Gurman (Bloomberg), Feb. 11, 2026
26.5. 27. Whatever it takes.

Foundry In Apple’s defense here, they’re not the only ones struggling to ship an AI feature.
[OpenAI] said its first hardware device won’t ship to customers before the end of February 2027.
Maxwell Zeff (Wired), Feb. 10, 2026
That thing that nobody knows what it is? Turns out Jony Ive and Sam Altman don’t know, either.
Apple also may have a few surprises up its sleeve this year as the company is expected to announce new home products, including a doorbell camera and lock that uses Face ID. The Macalope has been advocating for Apple to make its own home automation products for years, and the timing is good since Amazon seems to have stepped in something that a hypothetical lost dog left on its front lawn.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[It's not clear yet what this is for, but Apple is having an invite-only event not at Apple Park, but instead a joint event in New York City, London, and Shanghai on March 4. It might be time for all those M5 MacBook Pro, iPad, and iPhone 17e rumors to come true. Apple invite to New York City
We're curious what this is about. Apple doesn't typically have big product releases in New York City, let alone also in London and Shanghai simultaneously. They want to show something off, that's for sure.
That said, it may not necessarily be a major announcement. There is no sign of any streaming activity for the event, which reduces the chances of it being a big hardware release. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Rumors continue to say that Apple will release the first iPhone Fold in fall 2026, with the book-like design matching popular foldables already on the market. Companies like Samsung and Motorola also offer clamshell designs, similar to the iconic flip phones of the early 2000s.
Now, in a post on the Weibo Chinese social network, leaker Fixed Focus Digital claims that Apple could follow suit. But it's too early to know whether the phone will ever make its way to market. Rumor Score: Possible Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3064717/apples-march-event-might-bring-several-days-of-surprises.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld We now know the date of Apple’s next event-type thing: March 4. But as ever, we won’t know the precise details or the products the company plans to announce until it chooses to make that information public.
Unusually, however, there’s a good chance that Apple will tell us about the new products first and host the event (or, to use the company’s preferred terminology, the “experience”) after. Because one respected pundit has put forward the theory that Apple will announce new iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks via press release on Monday to Wednesday of that week, before journalists and influencers are gathered for a hands-on session with the hardware.
John Gruber, writing on his Daring Fireball blog, ponders the large number of Apple releases that are expected in the next few months. We’re waiting for the iPhone 17e, he notes, new versions of the entry-level iPad (with an A18 or A19 chip) and iPad Air (with an M4), M5 Pro and Max MacBook Pro, M5 MacBook Air, and the rumored low-cost MacBook with an A18 chip. That’s a lot to fit into a single event. Perhaps too much.
“What strikes me is that March 4—the ‘experience’ day—is a Wednesday,” Gruber writes. “So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the ‘experience’ will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos.”
Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who is generally keyed into Apple’s product launches, responded on X, saying Gruber’s guess “is exactly what I am expecting based on what I’ve heard.” Gurman has previously reported that Apple had a product launch slated for March 2.
There is a precedent for this sort of serial press release strategy. At the end of October 2024, Apple sent out announcements on consecutive days for the M4 iMac (October 28), M4 Mac mini (October 29), and M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro (October 30). The company even called this an “exciting week of announcements,” even though it only lasted for three days and wasn’t especially exciting, focusing only on the Mac section of its product portfolio. A week of announcements covering the iPhone, iPad, and Mac might do a better job of qualifying for that adjective.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple previously accused Qualcomm of “double-dipping” as a result of the company’s policies over selling radio chips for use in iPhones. The Cupertino company had also objected to Qualcomm charging a percentage of the price of an iPhone rather than a fixed fee per chip.
Apple withdrew its claims back in 2024, but an independent class-action lawsuit was still being pursued on behalf of iPhone owners. This lawsuit has now been abandoned …

Since 2020, the Car Key feature has allowed iPhone and Apple Watch owners to unlock and start their cars with the use of mobile devices. According to a social media post spotted on Monday, the 2026 Toyota Rav4 has gained support for Apple's Car Key system.
More than 30 vehicle manufacturers already support Apple's Car Key feature. At WWDC 2025, Apple explained that Car Key would make its way to 13 additional vehicle brands. Toyota might be the latest automaker to roll out Apple Car Key support, but there are a few caveats. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-no-new-siri-features/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The first beta of iOS 26.4 is available to developers and public beta testers, and the software includes no new Siri features. There were expectations of at least some new Apple Intelligence ‌Siri‌ capabilities because of how long the delays have been and persistent rumors suggesting Apple was targeting an iOS 26.4 release, but we'll have to wait longer for ‌Siri‌ updates. After Apple announced a delay for the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ version of ‌Siri‌ in March 2025, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple had set an internal launch target for iOS 26.4. He repeated the iOS 26.4 timeline in several subsequent reports, and even at the end of January, he suggested that Apple would unveil the more personalized version of ‌Siri‌ in February. delayed until iOS 26.5 or iOS 27. Gurman said the ‌Siri‌ features will be spread across several upcoming iOS releases. Some or all of the new ‌Siri‌ features could be introduced in iOS 26.5, or Apple might wait for iOS 27, which will be previewed in June 2026 at WWDC. Apple first showed off the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ version of ‌Siri‌ at the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, and it was supposed to come in iOS 18. Apple had to upgrade ‌Siri‌'s architecture to make the promised functionality work, and so far, that's taken over a year. ‌Siri‌ is apparently taking too long to respond to requests, and some queries aren't processed properly, which is what led to the iOS 26.4 ‌Siri‌ delay. Engineers are apparently using iOS 26.5 for further ‌Siri‌ testing right now, so some functionality could come in that update. There's still a possibility that new ‌Siri‌ features will be introduced in a later iOS 26.4 beta, but that's not guaranteed. Apple has been working to add personalization, onscreen awareness, and the ability for ‌Siri‌ to do more in and between apps. Not all of the features are working reliably and Apple is said to be having continual issues with accuracy. CNBC that the new version of ‌Siri‌ would still be coming at some point in 2026. Apple has never given a timeline more specific than 2026, so there hasn't been a second actual delay, just a disappointment based on rumors of an iOS 26.4 launch. iOS 26 launch could still happen.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3063779/move-over-meta-apple-smart-glasses-are-coming.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld In a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple has three wearable devices in the works that could establish Apple as a leader in AI hardware. Apple is “ramping up work” on smart glasses, a pendant, and AirPods with IR cameras. The three devices will not be stand-alone products and will require an iPhone connection. Apple smart glasses
Smart glasses appear to be the priority for Apple—don’t expect Apple glasses to be an augmented reality version of its Vision Pro headset. These glasses will be more like the Meta AI glasses, with a high-resolution camera capturing photos and video. The UI will depend on speakers, microphones, and a separate camera dedicated to “give the device environmental context.” Users will be able to make phone calls, use Siri, play music, and shoot photos. Also, the user will be able to “take actions based on surroundings.”
Gurman reports that Apple hopes its camera technology will separate it from Meta’s glasses. Apple is working on advanced features, such as the ability for the glasses to recognize text and convert it digitally, and the ability to create context-aware reminders, such as a prompt to tell you to pick up an item you are looking at that’s on your shopping list while in a grocery store. For navigational directions, Siri could provide landmarks instead of generic instructions. Apple also thinks it can offer superior build quality that differentiates it from Meta. The glasses will use “high-end materials, including acrylic elements intended to give the glasses a premium feel.” Different styles could be offered as the product matures over time. Apple had looked into partnering with a glasses maker, but decided against it.
Gurman stated that Apple made “significant progress” in the development of the glasses, and it could be ready for production by the end of the year, with a public release in early 2027. Apple AI pendant]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3062548/ios-26-4-beta-features-install-release.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld After Apple released iOS 26.3 last week, we were anticipating the first beta release of iOS 26.4 with bated breath. That’s because rumors for the better part of a year have pointed to this update as the one to bring the revamped Siri that has been expected since 2024. However, a rumor last week dampened those expectations considerably. Now it’s unclear if the 26.4 updates will have any of the “new Siri” at all, while some of its major features get pushed back.
Still, 26.4 seems like it should be a larger-than-usual update with several new features that aren’t Siri related.
iOS 26.4 beta: New features
We won’t know all of the new features and changes to expect in iOS 26.4 until the final version is released to users, likely in March. We’ll update this section with new features as we discover them.
New video podcast experience: Apple has announced that iOS 26.4 will enable HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) technology in the Podcast app to “switch seamlessly between watching and listening to shows.”
Apple Music: iOS 26.4 introduces a new interface for albums and playlists, and new ways to find concerts near you and tour dates for your favorites artists. There is a new AI playlist feature that generates playlists based on short text prompts. There’s a new home screen widget for accessing ambient music playlists, too.
RCS end-to-end encryption: It’s taken about a year, but Apple has an option to test end-to-end encryption in RCS messages. Apple specifically states this feature is not coming in 26.4 and will be available in a future release.
Stolen Device Protection: The feature introduced in iOS 17.3 will now be enabled by default starting with iOS 26.4.
Freeform: Apple’s whiteboarding app has gotten its Creator Studio update with new features and a new icon.
Reminders: There’s a new “Urgent” smart for any reminders you have marked as Urgent using the new feature introduced in iOS 26.2
Health: Bloody Oxygen has been added back to the “Vitals” overview, and the Sleep graph now has a line showing your average bedtime.
iOS 26.4 beta: How to install the public beta
If you want to test the iOS 26 beta releases but are not a registered developer, follow these steps:
Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID.
Log in to the Beta Software Program.
Click Enroll your iOS device.
Open the Settings app, tap General, then Software Update.
In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta.
It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update.
iOS 26.4 beta: How to install the developer beta
You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer, but a free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app:
Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store.
Open the app.
Tap on Account.
Sign in using your usual Apple ID.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3063625/finally-apple-adds-macbook-battery-charge-limit-to-macos-26-4.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple released the macOS 26.4 beta to developers on Monday, and those who have installed it have found a new feature that’s been a long time a-comin’. Apple is adding the ability to set a charge limit for the battery in a MacBook. With the new slider, you can set the limit to 80 percent, to 100 percent, or to an increment (in fives) in between. OH MY GAWD ! ! ! ! ! !
Charge limit option added in Tahoe 26.4 Beta!!!!! pic.twitter.com/SxNgMV3YsP
— Mr. Macintosh (@ClassicII_MrMac) February 16, 2026 Apple added an Optimize Battery Charging feature in macOS Catalina that uses machine learning to limit charging, but since then, users have been asking for the ability to manually set the charge limit below 100 percent. Apple added that ability for iPhones in iOS 18, and now finally coming to the Mac.
Why is this an important feature? Every time you charge and deplete the battery, it puts wear and tear on it, and over time, the battery carries less of a charge than it used to. Charging to 100 percent and depleting completely accelerates this process. Studies have shown that keeping the battery under 100 percent lowers the amount of wear and tear, thus making the battery healthier over a longer period of time. And the lower the upper limit you can manage, the better it is for battery health. Learn more about keeping a MacBook battery healthy.
There is one drawback to Apple adding this feature: The main feature of AlDente, a popular MacBook utility, is Sherlocked. However, AlDente does have a lot of features that are quite useful, such as the ability to recalibrate the battery, heat protection, the ability to control the color of the MagSafe LED,and a lot more–features Apple isn’t likely to incorprate.]]></description>

If you're like the rest of us, chances are you're getting a little tired of constant notifications from your devices. While this mostly happens on iPhone, you still can get quite a few notifications on Mac.
There aren't too many settings to change on Mac, but there are a few you should be aware of. Here's how you can customize your notification preferences. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/2974412/cosmic-orange-gift-guide-iphone-17-pro-cases-cables-docks-accessories.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple stunned the world with its bold new Cosmic Orange color for the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max. I can’t even name the other colors they are available in… Dark Blue? Sort of White? Who cares? It has to be orange!
Decision made, now comes the real challenge: accessorizing. If you’re going to walk around with a phone that looks like a tiny glowing sunset, you can’t just pair it with any random case, cable, or charger. This is a color that demands commitment.
There are plenty of orange things out these—not all good—but which of the best ones most closely match the new iPhone? Known to others as Papaya with the Pantone specification 15-1243, Apple’s Cosmic Orange is a vivid, slightly lighter orange with a bit more yellow than a traditional copper tone. It’s special, just like your iPhone.
We’ve rounded up the best orange accessories to turn your phone into a fully coordinated citrus masterpiece. Even if you don’t yet own a Cosmic Orange iPhone, you have a grotto of gaudy goodies to gift to your friends who do. Kuxiu X40 Turbo 25W 3-in-1 Foldable Wireless Charging Stand Kuxiu First on any iPhone user’s list should be a fast charger and this up-to-the-minute Qi 2.2-certified gadget is as fast a wireless iPhone charger as you can get: 25W of raw power, which is perfect for the iPhone 17 family. Even if it was 5W it wouldn’t really matter, would it? It’s a glorious orange!
It folds right down to a pocketable 2.5-inch square and 0.7-inch deep 5oz tiny slab. But of course it’s finest attribute isn’t the premium build or tiny form factor, but its glowing Cosmic Orange color.
Find the Cosmic Orange X40 Turbo in the U.S. through Kuxiu ($79), while U.K. orangeers can get it on Amazon (£66).
Kuxiu also sells a slightly cheaper, but larger, version called the X55 Turbo. Journey MOTION Apple Watch Sport Band Journey There are a bunch of orange Apple Watch bands to choose from, in orangy colors such as “Terracotta” and “Turmeric”, but we think the closest match to the iPhone 17 Pro is the orange MOTION Sport Band from Aussie brand Journey.
At $59/£49, it’s also more affordable (at Journey) than the selection of pricey bands on offer at the Apple Store. Match your wrist to your iPhone and you’ll bring brightness to your day as soon as you wake up. UAG Civilian Case UAG If the Cosmic Orange iPhone is so gorgeous, why cover it up in a dull case? Sacrilege, surely. Think again… the iPhone Pro is too lovely to risk dents and dings or a shattered screen, but you still want the world to know you’re hip to be orange. Just like the army of orange Watch straps, there are many orange iPhone cases, but our fave is the ultra-thin UAG Civilian ($65) that isn’t as fancy as some but offers great defensive strength, including 20-foot (6m) drop protection. UAG doesn’t limit its orange to the Civilian; it has juicy versions of its Monarch Pro and Pathfinder cases, too.
If you must have an Apple case, skip the iPhone 17 Pro clear case that’s more white than clear. Instead, opt for the Orange iPhone 17 Pro Silicone Case with MagSafe ($49) or Sierra Orange Beats iPhone 17 Pro Rugged Case ($79), both pictured below—you can even buy the Beats case for a humble iPhone 17—we won’t tell anyone if you don’t. Apple dbrand Cosmic Orange Skins dbrand We love the dbrand iPhone cases, too, but here we highlight their shameless and self-confessed “flawless colormatched knock-off” skins that can transform a ton of other products into Cosmic Orange beauty. Whether your MacBook, iPad, AirPods, or one of hundreds of even non-Apple products (even Android phones) can now cosplay as an iPhone 17 Pro Max.
The skins are precisely cut vinyl wraps that adhere to a device for the custom Cosmic look, offering scratch protection without adding any bulk. Take a look at all the tempting things to wrap in dbrand orange here with prices starting below $40. Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad Belkin Why put your iPhone on a black or white charging pad when you can power up your cheery Cosmic Orange iPhone and sad white AirPods on the beautifully orange Belkin BoostCharge Pro Wireless Charging Pad ($75/£74). Certified by Apple with its MagSafe badge, this flat charging pad can hit 15W of power—not as fast as the 25W Kuxiu X40 Turbo but speedy enough on your nightstand while you doze from orange sunset to sunrise. Bellroy Butterscotch backpacks, bags and slings Bellroy Bellroy doesn’t label the boldest color available in its range of laptop backpacks as orange or cosmic, but this “Butterscotch” backpack will go great with your iPhone 17 Pro.
In Butterscotch, Bellroy has a Classic Daypack or larger Classic Backpack (16L or 20L), both with a protective 16-inch laptop sleeve. If that weren’t enough, you can pick up a Classic Tote, Getaway Bag, and even a Sling with padded iPhone protection. Prices start at $99. Statik SmartCharge Pro Statik 15000mAh is enough battery power to recharge a faded Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro nearly three times over, and even get a decent shot of backup power into your (sadly not orange unless you skin it with the dbrand vinyl wrap, reviewed above) MacBook.
The high-capacity $99 Statik SmartCharge Pro has a bunch of tools, just like a Swiss Army power penknife: 15K battery pack, 15W wireless charging pad for iPhone, Apple Watch or AirPods case, and built-in 60W USB-C cable. You even get U.K., E.U. and AU/NZ plug adapters for your travels (or the region you live in), although these are sadly black rather than orange—no matter black and orange go well together. Orbitkey Travel Sling Orbitkey Sometimes you need top do something else other than gaze at your beautiful orange iPhone. Really. Keep your iPhone and all its accessories (orange of course) in the weather-resistant $89 Orbitkey Travel Sling, which hosts a surprisingly generous 3L capacity and can be worn as a crossbody or carried as a compact pouch. There’s a quick access front zip pocket, a wide opening for effortless access to all compartments, and inside you’ll find integrated mesh pockets. Hidden RFID-blocking pockets and an anti-theft zipper locking system keep digital theft and pickpockets at bay – without impairing your access. Nomad ChargeKey Nomad So small and handy that you don’t need even the orange Orbitkey Travel Sling (see above), the affordable but super-premium $29 Nomad ChargeKey makes a great keychain accessory in limited edition Cosmic Orange. It’s a USB-C cable that delivers both in terms of charging power (240W) and data transfer (10Gbps), and is as gorgeous as the Cosmic Orange 17 Pro with a neat braided nylon sheath and electroplated zinc stain cable tips. Statik MagStack Pro USB-C Cable Statik If that built-in cable isn’t long enough for you, Statik also sells a quality braided USB-C cable in what it calls “Blaze Orange”. MagStack Pro cable is available in 3.3ft (1m) or 6.6ft (2m) lengths, and can carry up to 100W of power. Even better, it is magnetized so automatically wraps up into a neat coil when you’re done with it. Torras Cosmic Orange Special Set Torras Best known for its iPhone cases, Torras has gone all-in on orange with its Cosmic Orange Special Set ($165/£128) that includes a color-matched case, screen protector, charger, and crossfit strap.
To be fair, the screen protector is helpfully clear rather than orange but the application tray makes up for it. You can buy the charger separately (see below) and choose between the Cosmic Orange LoopGo Flex Crossbody Phone Lanyard and Apple’s plain Orange Crossbody Strap. Torras Icenano FoldPro Fast Charger Block 45W Orange Torras If you don’t need the full set, you’ll be happy with the tiny orange charger. Built with a Gallium Nitride (GaN) chip, Torras’s Icenano FoldPro USB-C wall charger ($35) is cooler in temperature (and therefore smaller and lighter) but much hotter in attitude. At 45W, it’s got plenty to spare when fast-charging your iPhone 17 Pro Max, and can even power up your MacBook Air. Case Logic Reflect Laptop Sleeve Case Logic Your MacBook will thank you for the 6mm of dense memory foam that provides a protective cushion and the plush interior lining that defends the laptop from scratches, but forget all that stuff because the outside of the Case Logic Reflect Laptop Sleeve ($45) is a very Cosmic Orange, so you can hide that Silver or Space Gray monstrosity. Antler Heritage Leather AirPods Case, plus luggage tags and straps in Coral Antler Looking for a little class with your iPhone 17 Pro on your next trip? Then look no further than Antler’s lovely Coral range of travel accessories (from $20 / £14), including luggage tags and straps, packing cubes and even a cute orange AirPods case ($75 / £55). You’re not fooling anyone, Antler… your accessories are orange, not coral… unless they are actually made of coral, of course. Weatherman umbellas Weatherman It doesn’t rain but it pours Cosmic Orange gear on us, and we have just the thing for it—the Rusty Orange Weatherman Travel Umbrella ($69/£60). You’ll be delighted to see clouds in the sky when it means you can hoist our orange one proudly through the deluge without fear of getting our other Cosmic Orange goodies drenched.
However… Rusty Orange? Surely, an umbrella this colorful won’t let your IP68-rated iPhone actually corrode. Logitech POP Icon Orange Keyboard Logitech Back at your desk, sometimes you have to use an old-school computer rather than your Cosmic Orange iPhone, even if it is a 17 Pro Max. Apple does make an orange version of its Magic Keyboard, but unless you can find a used one, you’ll need to buy an orange iMac to get it (see below).
So rest your eyes on this orange-accented keyboard from Logitech. The POP Icon Keyboard ($49/£49) in Off White &amp; Orange isn’t completely orange, but all the letters and funny symbols are. As it connects via Bluetooth, you can even pair it with your iPhone and ditch the desktop altogether. Orange Apple iMac Apple One of Apple’s first G3 iMacs was orange—or “Tangerine” as Steve Jobs called it. In those days, however, orange wasn’t as hip as it is today, and the Tangerine iMac was a bit of a failure, at least compared to Blueberry and Strawberry. (Fun orange fact: the iMac’s designer, Jony Ive, used to work at a design agency called Tangerine.)
Fortunately, Tim Cook has forgotten the Tangerine Nightmare, and you can buy a colorful iMac again (from $1,299/£1,299) and this time in Orange—not Cosmic but very close, at least on the back. The iMac even comes with a keyboard and mouse with orange accents. Other orange Apple stuff Apple In fact, Apple makes quite a few things under its orange umbrella, even if they aren’t as cosmic as the iPhone. You can buy an AirTag Key Ring and MagSafe Wallet both in “Fox Orange”, Crossbody Strap for your iPhone, and an orange HomePod mini, Electric Orange PowerBeats Pro 2, and some faded orange AirPods Max. Jan Gruber (Foundry) Issey Miyake iPhone Pocket Apple Ok, so this is a long shot, but you might even be tempted by one of the craziest accessories on the Apple Store: the $149/£139 iPhone Pocket by Issey Miyake—available in “Mandarin”. Mandarin? Orange, ok? It’s not technically an Apple product, even if it is clearly inspired by the legendary and no doubt highly successful (I’ve forgotten) iPod Socks—also available in orange but long gone by now. Anker MagGo Power Bank (5K, Slim) – Coral Apple Consulting the electronic brain of AI, I learned that Coral is either “a pinkish-orange or an orange-pink”. While the Antler luggage accessories in Coral avoided any sort of pinkness in favor of a very Cosmic Orange, Anker’s MagGo Power Bank in Coral (£49; not available in the U.S. for some reason) is decidedly un-orange pink, which actually might be useful if reports are true that the orange iPhone turns pink when scrubbed too hard with cleaning agents.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Investment firm Wedbush is telling its clients to ignore recent reports of delays to Siri, saying that 2026 is when Apple Intelligence will be a boon. The new Siri is coming
Wedbush took its Apple target price up to $350 in December 2025, based on high expectations for Apple Intelligence. Keeping that figure, it then repeated this expectation in January 2026 — and is now back to do so again, specifically because of recent rumors.
Those rumors claimed that testing of the new Siri is going poorly, and its improved features will be delayed, perhaps until iOS 27 in September. Consequently, investors have been selling off their Apple shares, but Wedbush says this is unwarranted. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A code snippet discovered in iOS 26.4 shows that CarPlay could gain an Apple TV app for playback while parked, though the implementation details aren't available. Apple TV is coming to CarPlay
Apple has quietly been adding video playback to CarPlay in iOS 26, but the feature requires the vehicle to be parked. Code discovered in the iOS 26.4 beta suggests that the Apple TV could be coming to the platform.
According to the code shared by user Aaronp613 on X, users will be asked to log in to Apple TV via their iPhone for access to the app on CarPlay. It seems that this could mean that media playback is possible, but there will be obvious restrictions. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

In 2023, Apple rolled out a new feature called Stolen Device Protection. The feature is designed to prevent iPhones from being accessed if a thief manages to both learn a user's passcode and steal their iPhone.
This was a crucial change, as more and more reports rolled in, showing that this type of theft was on the rise. An experienced thief could easily access a user's list of passwords, access bank accounts, and disable safety features such as Find My and Trusted Devices.

      <description><![CDATA[Apple has taken a small step toward securing cross-platform messaging, with early RCS encryption support now appearing in the iOS 26.4 beta. Just don't expect to get that much testing done right now. RCS support will be extended to include end-to-end encryption
Way back in March 2025, Apple announced that it would add support for end-to-end encryption to RCS messaging on iPhone. At the time, there were very few details about when the feature would be implemented.
We got our first hint that the feature was, at the very least, being worked on in January. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple added RCS support to iPhone with iOS 18.1, enabling richer cross-platform messaging between iPhone and Android users. This included things like typing indicators, read receipts, and high-resolution photo and video attachments.
Last March, Apple announced its plans to add support for end-to-end encryption for RCS messages.
Now, iOS 26.4 beta 1, which is rolling out today, adds an early way to test end-to-end encrypted RCS messaging on iPhone.

      <description><![CDATA[A new rumor claims Apple has no major redesign imminent for the iPad Pro, potentially leaving the flagship tablet in an extended cycle of incremental updates. iPad Pro might not see updates for a while
On February 16, Instant Digital posted that Apple won't be redesigning the iPad Pro significantly for a while. The report indicates that Apple will stick to routine chip updates without making major changes to the device's design.
The post states that the iPad Pro won't receive a major upgrade for years. The leaker attributes the pause to the high cost of OLED panels and limited sales growth following the last redesign.
Instant Digital has had a mixed track record with Apple leaks on Weibo. Sometimes they share accurate details like the iPhone 16 camera control button, but other times they promote claims that aren't supported by the facts or what actually happens.

It's already been claimed that iOS 27 will concentrate on Apple Intelligence, but also that Apple's internal code names for the work have recently changed. Now Bloomberg says that a major focus for the operating system update will be about reworking existing elements.

      <description><![CDATA[Following reports of dwindling stocks of the iPhone 16e, there are now ones about the Mac Studio. While a new one is coming, in 2026 there are just too many external factors to use it as a reliable indicator of an imminent launch. Two Mac Studios, stacked
It seems such an obvious thing — if Apple is running low on the Mac Studio, it's because a new one is coming. And it seems such an easy thing to spot, since the online Apple Store details how long the delivery time is for any item.
So if you used to be able to get a custom Mac Studio the day after tomorrow in most cases, but now Apple says it'll take weeks, clearly stocks are low. It's then the rumor mill syllogism: a new device is expected, stocks are now low, therefore the new device is imminent. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple stake by 4% in the fourth quarter of 2025, but Apple remains the conglomerate's largest equity holding by a wide margin. Berkshire Hathaway trims its Apple investment
A February 17 regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows Berkshire trimmed its Apple position during the quarter ended December 31, 2025. Apple was still valued at roughly $62 billion within Berkshire's portfolio at year's end.
The filing also shows Berkshire sold 77% of its Amazon stake in the same quarter, a far more substantial reduction than the modest adjustment to Apple. The latest stock cut by Berkshire isn't a harbinger of doom but rather a routine portfolio adjustment. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

It seems the March 4 Apple Experience won't be an actual launch of new products in Apple's catalog, but instead capping off multiple announcements during the week. That gives Apple a lot of opportunity to promote multiple items.
With the breadth of rumored devices on the docket, including many anticipated for launch in earlu 2026. it certainly needs that opportunity. But, as ever, some have more chance of making an appearance than others. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple may return to its marketing playbook, delivering multiple press releases of big products in just a few days, then highlight them all at the international March 4 "experiences." Apple's experience logo has many layers. The announcement of a special event on March 4 has led to wild speculation of what Apple could introduce at the time. However, with so many oddities surrounding it all, it may not be as straightforward as people think.
On Tuesday, Daring Fireball's John Gruber proposed that Apple's reference of it as an "experience" day is unusual. The choice of holding the event on a Wednesday is also unexpected, especially when you factor in Apple's preference for Tuesday product announcements.

Apple has a special event taking place on March 4, but a subsequent report says that this will not include a keynote presentation. Instead, it says we can expect a series of press releases along the lines of the ones we saw back in 2024 …

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3063982/apple-ends-rosetta-support-macos-28.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple has made a major announcement this week that could affect the software you use, especially if it’s an older app, and you are using an M-series Mac. In a support document, Apple wrote that it will start to phase out Rosetta functionality with macOS 28. That means in two years, apps that were written for Intel-based Macs will no longer run on M-series Macs, except for “certain older, unmaintained games.”
When Apple began its switch from Intel chips to its own M-series chips in 2020, it changed the architecture of the underlying workings of the Mac. To help navigate the transition, Apple created Rosetta, which acts as a translator of Intel-based apps so they can run on M-series Macs. Rosetta will be included in macOS 27, which is expected to be released this fall. After that, Apple will limit the Rosetta implementation in macOS 28.
It’s been over five years since the first M1 Macs debuted. By the time macOS 28 is released in the fall of 2027, it’ll be seven years–Apple has a history of deprecating products after such time.
Developers have had plenty of time to update their software to either support M-series Macs exclusively or run universally on either chip. You can check an app’s compatibility by selecting the app’s icon and pressing Command+I on the keyboard. This will open a software info window, and in the General section, look at the listing for Kind. This will show one of the following:
Application (Apple silicon): The app was written for Apple chips
Application (Universal): The app was written for both Apple and Intel chips]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/18/perplexity-abandons-ai-advertising/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[AI company Perplexity is stepping away from advertising over concerns that it will erode user trust, despite moves by rivals to introduce ads as an alternative money-making strategy. Perplexity was one of the first AI services to embrace ads in 2024, after it ran tests where sponsored answers appeared under the chatbot's answers. That approach however was phased out last year, and executives at the company now say they don't plan to revisit it, according to the Financial Times. "A user needs to believe this is the best possible answer, to keep using the product and be willing to pay for it," a Perplexity executive told the publication. earlier this month to show ads to ChatGPT users who have a free account or a low-cost Go subscription. OpenAI has said ads will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides, nor will it provide advertisers with content from ChatGPT conversations. mocked OpenAI for its decision to show ads to users and has said it has no plans to do the same. The company argues that including ads in Claude would not be in line with its mission of creating a helpful assistant for work and deep thinking, and that users should not need to second-guess whether an AI is being helpful or "subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable." Google features advertising in AI mode and in its AI Overviews summaries on traditional search results. However, Google has not introduced ads into its Gemini chatbot so far. Tag: Perplexity

      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/anthropic-releases-claude-sonnet-4-6/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Anthropic today updated its Sonnet model to version 4.6, and the company says it is the most capable Sonnet model to date with upgrades across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, agent planning, knowledge work, and design. Claude Sonnet 4.6 is the default for users who have Free and Pro plans, and it has an updated 1M token context window. Sonnet 4.6 improves consistency and instruction following for coding, it's better at computer use tasks, and it can complete office tasks that previously required an Opus model. Sonnet 4.6 has human-level capability for tasks like navigating a complex spreadsheet or filling out a multi-step web form. According to Anthropic, Sonnet 4.6 has a "a broadly warm, honest, prosocial, and at times funny character, very strong safety behaviors, and no signs of major concerns around high-stakes forms of misalignment." It offers Opus-level intelligence at a more affordable price point, so it is practical for a wider range of tasks. Opus 4.6 is still the better option for agentic coding, agentic code use, and multidisciplinary reasoning, but Sonnet 4.6 offers measurable improvements over Sonnet 4.5. Tag: Anthropic

The star of the show is their new MagSafe power bank that combines Qi2.2 wireless charging, a built-in USB-C cable, and an integrated kickstand into a slim 10,000mAh design.

      <description><![CDATA[The 2026 revamp of Apple Intelligence and Siri is imminent, and Playlist Playground in iOS 26.4 shows Apple will continue to treat AI as a background tool, not a flagship feature. Apple Intelligence is meant to be a background feature
If you've been paying attention, Apple's strategy with artificial intelligence has always been about keeping it in the background. It augments human users rather than replacing them or stealing from them.
System-wide access to controls via app intents and the more personalized Siri won't or will be groundbreaking, depending on any given user's workflow. Apple isn't treating AI as some kind of world-altering paradigm that needs to overtake every part of the product. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

According to Apple's developer documentation, a new feature called Foveated Streaming is available with visionOS 26.4. It helps ensure processing power is saved by only rendering what the user is looking at in the highest resolution and limiting detail in the periphery.

      <description><![CDATA[Beta testers of the new macOS Tahoe 26.4 are getting warned that their favorite Intel-only apps won't work in macOS 28, because Rosetta 2 is getting killed. macOS will notify users of apps that will no longer work in the future
Rosetta 2 was introduced as a way to allow apps made for Intel chips to continue working on Apple Silicon. Over five years after its introduction in November 2020, Apple's warning users that it is going away.
As part of Monday's first developer beta build of macOS Tahoe 26.4, Apple has included a warning that tells users that some apps on their Mac will eventually stop working. In cases where users launch an app that relies on Rosetta 2, a warning will appear, advising that the app won't work when it pulls support for the translation layer.

Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.4 on Monday, but it didn't include the rumored Apple Intelligence improvements. Instead, it seems to contain a range of user-facing features, including HLS video podcast support in Apple Podcasts and other updates.
Among the Apple Music updates was what initially appeared to be unused discovered by Macworld, which highlighted a potential incoming feature that could release along with iOS 26.4.

Apple's long-promised Apple Intelligence overhaul of Siri still hasn't appeared in public builds, but the delay reflects deliberate pacing rather than a product in trouble.
The company reset expectations in 2025, announcing that a more personalized Siri with deeper app integration would come in 2026. Since then, reports have suggested that the original spring target faced some testing challenges. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[On February 16, 2016, Apple published a statement it knew would be criticized, and laid out the reasons it would not bow to unfair government pressure. We're apparently in a very different world today. The White House is dominating Apple Park — image credits: Apple and the White House
Ten years ago on February 16, 2016, Apple drew a line in the sand. The FBI had cleverly and even callously timed an attack on the firm to take advantage of public outrage over the San Bernardino shootings.
Fourteen people had been murdered in a terrorist attack in California's San Bernardino in December 2015. By February 2016, then FBI director James Comey told senators that they had one of the killers' phones that they hadn't been able to open.

      <description><![CDATA[Historically, Apple's March has been oddly busy in recent years, but as the company teases its newest "special Apple experience" happening on March 4, 2026, here's a look back at what we've seen before, and what we might see this time. Apple used to deck out conference halls for its launches —- this time for the iPad 3
That March 4, 2026 event is invitation-only one in New York, London, and Shanghai, and won't be streamed. It's being called an Apple Experience, too, which is the term the company used for the January 2026 event around the Apple Creator Studio .
If this a product announcement, though, then there is a precedent for it. And while there weren't even any Apple March events at all until 2008, since then they have been wide-ranging. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's next event is happening on March 4, it's not at Apple Park. In Apple's marketing world, location definitely matters. Apple Park, where most Apple events take place
Whenever Apple announces a new event and sends out invitations, the immediate thought is that it is for the launch of a new product. The rumor mill is then immediately scoured for potential items to launch at the event.
What many industry observers don't immediately consider is where the event is taking place. The problem is, that historically has bearing on what Apple is about to say. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Filming of the fourth season of spy thriller Tehran was underway when Eden was discovered in an Athens hotel on Sunday. Discovered by her brother, Eden's death is being treated as a suicide initially, with an investigation underway to determine what happened to her.
Israeli public broadcaster Kan, which produces the show along with Apple TV, called Eden a senior figure in Israel's television industry, reports Deadline. She played a central role in creating some of Kan's major productions in her career. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The long-awaited low-cost MacBook powered by an A18 Pro chip is now expected to launch on March 4. It will reportedly be priced somewhere around $700, making it significantly cheaper than an entry-level MacBook Air.
Given that the upcoming machine is likely to meet the needs of a great many of those who currently opt for the MacBook Air, it could cannibalize a lot of sales. One possible solution to this is to use the strategy Apple once adopted with the iBook and Powerbook lineups … more…]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The Ugreen NASync DH4300 is a very easy-to-use and affordable network attached storage appliance for beginners who need more capacity than your typical entry-level network storage appliance, or for folks who are still relying on a Time Capsule for backup. Ugreen NASync DH4300 Plus
We're getting to a point with cloud storage that in the long run, having a local cloud is a good idea. And, network attached storage (NAS) isn't just for networking experts anymore.
But, it's easy to underestimate needs. That local cloud basic user could go for entry-level options with two drives, which is fine for most, but when you start thinking about other stuff to do, simply isn't enough when data storage needs grow.

      <description><![CDATA[Hard drive prices will continue to be high for quite some time, as the needs of AI data centers continue to consume storage and raise prices for everyone. WD has run out of 2026 drive production capacity. Expect hard drives to stay expensive for a while. One of the major talking points about artificial intelligence has been its impact on memory prices. The demand has caused components to become more expensive to manufacturers like Apple, as well as to consumers, thanks to the build-out of infrastructure needed for AI.
Memory may have made headlines, but it's far from the only component feeling the squeeze. It's also happening to the hard drive market, too. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's February 2026 App Store data shows iOS 26 adoption closely tracking the pace set by iOS 18 in January 2025, and iPadOS 26 is ahead of iPadOS 18, undercutting claims that the upgrade cycle is faltering. Apple publishes OS 26 adoption data
Apple publishes operating system adoption rates based on devices that transacted on the App Store. The February 12, 2026 data can be measured against Apple's January 24, 2025 published figures for a like-for-like comparison.
The breakdown separates recently introduced hardware from the full active installed base. Because Apple publishes these numbers annually, it allows for a category-matched comparison between the 2025 and 2026 cycles at the same stage.

      <description><![CDATA[When automating your smart home, much of the attention centers on cameras and lights, but I believe HomeKit door sensors are arguably among the most critical devices to add to your setup. I’ve written about Onvis before, but the Smart Security Alarm Contact Sensor (CS2) takes the concept of a simple door sensor and turns it into a lot more. It supports Thread, but the really cool add-on here is a 120dB siren built right into the sensor. Let’s take a look at the Onvis CS2.

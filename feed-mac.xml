      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple launched the M5 MacBook Pro in October 2025, but many are still waiting for the company to launch the superior M5 Pro and M5 Max versions of the MacBook Pro. The good news is we may not have to wait for much longer, with the new MacBook Pro possibly launching on, or before, March 4. This article will keep track of rumors about the M5 Pro and M5 Max, when they might launch, what specs and features can be expected, and will offer perspective based on Apple’s Mac lineup. Here’s everything we know so far.
We’ll also address the question: Would power users be wise to wait a little longer for the much bigger changes rumored to be just around the corner? The M6 generation of the MacBook Pro could offer a touch screen and more, according to reports.

These higher-end variants push the boundaries of Apple Silicon by scaling up core counts and memory interfaces and offer a more advanced architecture with greater flexibility for CPU, GPU, and memory configurations. These models also include additional ports, like Thunderbolt 5, that aren’t yet supported at the entry-level.
While the standard M5 MacBook Pro that debuted in October 2025 was little more than a chip refresh to the consumer-targeted version of the machine, the upcoming M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are expected to deliver significant performance leaps to the MacBook Pro, particularly in graphics and artificial intelligence.
Reports indicate that we can expect a typical performance boost from one chip generation to another – between 15 and 25 percent over the equivalent M4 chips. However, based on the performance gains observed in the base M5 chip – which saw a 13% increase in single-core and a 22% increase in multi-core performance over the M4 – projections for the M5 Pro and Max are optimistic. The M5 Max is expected to be a “AI monster,” potentially cracking the 250,000-point mark in Geekbench 6 GPU compute tests, a feat previously only approached by the M3 Ultra with double the GPU cores. M5 Pro and M5 Max chips: Rumored features and specifications
New chip design for the M5 Pro and M5 Max could feature the CPU and GPU on separate blocks.
The M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are expected to be substantial upgrades over the M4 Pro and M4 Max. Current reports suggest Apple may maintain similar core counts to the M4 generation while focusing on architectural efficiency improvements and higher clock speeds. Although exact specifications have not been confirmed, both chips are expected to scale well beyond the base M5’s 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU configuration. More notably, the M5 Pro and M5 Max are rumored to introduce a major architectural shift aimed at improving AI and parallel processing performance. In October 2025, MaxTech’s Vadim Yuryev reported that Apple is developing a redesigned chip layout that separates the CPU and GPU into distinct blocks. This modular approach could enable more flexible CPU and GPU configurations — for example, pairing a base CPU configuration with a fully enabled GPU. Yuryev suggested that this architectural overhaul is the reason the M5 Pro and M5 Max may be delayed until 2026.
The high-end models are also rumored to use TSMC’s “SoIC-MH” packaging technology, which allows vertical stacking of semiconductor components. This approach is expected to improve thermal efficiency and performance compared to the standard 3nm process used in the base M5. These chips are expected to debut in 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with dual-fan cooling systems, offering better sustained performance under heavy workloads compared to the single-fan base M5 configuration.
At a glance: Process Technology: Built on TSMC’s third-generation 3nm process (N3P), delivering roughly 10% better efficiency and 5% higher performance compared to the M4 series.
Memory Bandwidth &amp; Capacity: Expected to deliver nearly a 30% increase in memory bandwidth (around 153 GB/s on the base M5), with the Pro and Max scaling even further for higher throughput. M5 Pro: At least 48GB RAM
M5 Max: Up to 128GB+ RAM. The Max variant is also expected to remain the only option supporting up to 8TB of storage. GPU Capabilities &amp; AI Performance: Expected improvements include: Third-generation hardware-accelerated ray tracing.
Second-generation dynamic caching.
A rumored “Neural Accelerator” in each GPU core (separate from the standard Neural Engine). Together, these upgrades could enable up to a 4x increase in GPU-based AI workload performance, with the Pro and Max variants further scaling graphics and AI capabilities for demanding professional applications.
Connectivity: Confirmed support for Thunderbolt 5, offering up to 120Gbps for video and 80Gbps for data transfer.
Architecture and Design: Reports suggest higher-end models will separate CPU and GPU blocks, enabling more flexible configurations (e.g., base CPU paired with a max-tier GPU). The architecture is expected to share core design elements with the A19 Pro, improving scalability for professional and AI-heavy workloads. New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Specs
N1 chip: Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6. Thunderbolt 5.
With the launch of the M4 MacBook Pro, Apple made a series of upgrades that replaced outdated components, including upping the base RAM to 16GB, bringing Thunderbolt 5 to the M4 Pro and Max models, and offering a Nano-texture glass option. The M5 MacBook Pro saw no changes to the specs other than the processor. The Bluetooth and Wi-Fi remained the same. A new 4TB SSD option was added, but in the U.K. and Europe, Apple has removed the Power Adapter from the box.
However, more is expected for the MacBook Pro M5 Pro and Max: Apple may integrate the N1 chip, as used in the iPhone 17, which will bring Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6, as well as improve features like Personal Hotspot and AirDrop. Apple The entry-level model still only offers Thunderbolt 4, but the Max and Pro will continue to offer Thunderbolt 5. There are reports that Apple is working on a 5G modem for the Mac, but it’s unlikely to arrive before 2026. New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Camera
No change expected.
The M4 MacBook Pro added a 12MP FaceTime camera, a decent upgrade from the 1080p FaceTime camera. The M5 Macook Pro maintains this camera, so it is unlikely the Pro and Max models will gain anything. However, we could see a similar FaceTime camera update to 18MP as seen on the iPhone 17. The square sensor is less relevant here as the MacBook Pro will only ever be in one orientation, although it could allow for more of the area around a person to be visible.
More changes are rumored for the camera in the M6 generation: reports suggest that in the future we may see a hole-punch webcam instead of a notch. Petter Ahrnstedt New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Design rumors
No change to the design expected.
Apple last updated the design of the MacBook Pro in 2021. There was no change to the MacBook Pro’s design when Apple introduced the M5 model. Apple will likely stick with the current design for the M5 Pro and Max models. It’s always possible that a new color makes an appearance—like Space Black in 2023—but for the most part, the MacBook Pro design is set for at least another year.
There have been suggestions that an overhaul of the MacBook design could mark the 20th anniversary of the MacBook Pro (the MacBook Pro launched in January 2006 replacing the PowerBook). However, the rumors aren’t pointing to an early 2026 redesign.
Instead, the bigger changes are expected for the M6 generation. In July 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the M5 MacBook Pro series would be the last of the current design. Apple appears to be saving the next major design upgrade for the M6 MacBook Pro for 2026. The M6 upgrade is said to include OLED screens, a camera “hole” to replace the notch, and a thinner design.
New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Display rumors
No changes to the display expected.
Big changes are said to be coming to the M6 MacBook Pro. Foundry There is no change to the display on the M5 MacBook Pro, so it’s unlikely that the M5 Max and M5 Pro models will get any screen updates. Although we could see a higher nits brightness rating, up from the current 1,600 nits peak. As for display support, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips will continue to differentiate themselves from the base M5 through superior expansion and display support. While the standard M5 is limited to two external displays, the M5 Pro is expected to support at least two 6K displays, and the M5 Max will likely support up to four external displays
More changes to the display could be in the pipeline, but not for this generation. Back on February 11, 2025, The Elec reported that OLED displays for the MacBook Pro were going into production, but these weren’t expected to feature in the laptop until 2026. Unfortunately, the big display changes seem set to arrive with a subsequent generation of MacBook Pro, with rumors, again, pointing to Apple introducing OLED screens for the M6 generation of MacBook Pro.
There could be something even more exciting coming with the M6 generation: a touchscreen! Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple is going to launch a MacBook with a touch screen, and it could arrive on a MacBook Pro as soon as 2026. However, this update is not expected to arrive until the M6 generation and could be delayed until 2027. Apple could be saving any drastic changes to the MacBook Pro for 2026. Foundry New M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro: Release date
Launch by March 4, 2026
Apple is expected to release the updated MacBook Pro models featuring M5 Pro and M5 Max chips in the spring of 2026. Apple has confirmed it will hold a series of global “experiences” on March 4, 2026, in New York, London, and Shanghai. Unlike a traditional keynote event, these coordinated sessions are expected to be extended hands-on experiences for the press to interact with new hardware, and the M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro is likely to be one of the new products being demoed at that “experience”. Specific details regarding the launch include:
Experience day: Apple has invited some press to “experiences” on March 4, in London, New York and Shanghai. Production status: Reports from early 2025 indicated that fabrication facilities for these “high-end M5 models” were already being prepared, utilizing TSMC’s advanced SoIC-MH process for improved thermal management.
In December 2025, a MacRumors report indicated that a kernel debug kit used by Apple engineers referenced MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, indicating that the update is coming soon.
On February 1, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple plans to ship the M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro around the time when macOS 26.3 is released. That version is currently in beta and could be released in February or March.
On February 4, Apple released the release candidate for macOS 26.3. This indicates that the software is almost ready to go and could be officially released in the next week or two. The new laptops could follow shortly after or be released at the same time.
On February 9, Gurman reported that the macOS 26.3 beta release candidate cycle runs through March. A release of the new laptops “is currently slated for as early as the week of March 2.”
On February 22, Gurman indicated that Apple will launch “at least five new products” by March 4, and that could include the M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro. Why the Delay?
The staggered release – launching the base M5 in late 2025 while holding back the Pro and Max versions – is reportedly due to a significant architectural shift. As discussed above, the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips are rumored to feature a new design that separates CPU and GPU blocks, which may allow for greater customization at the time of purchase to meet the parallel processing demands of AI. New M5 MacBook Pro: Price
Prices are unlikely to change.
Reports suggest pricing for M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pros will align with the current Pro and Max models.
Here are the prices for the current standard configurations of the M4 Pro and Max MacBook Pro, for reference. Prices are unlikely to change.

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple ships a simple but effective charging cable with the Apple Watch that will fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7 or later (Watch 8/9/10/11, Watch Ultra 1/2/3). You won’t find a faster charging accessory but you can also choose from a wide range of stylish and practical charging stands, docks and power banks for your Apple Watch—including some that can also charge other Apple devices such as your iPhone and AirPods.
Here, we round up the best Apple Watch chargers, docks and charging stands—some of which can charge your other Apple devices at the same time. Most should be compatible with all generations of the Watch, but be sure to check compatibility before buying.
See below the product chart for more on Apple Watch fast-charging, including the expected charging times of each Apple Watch.
There are simple charging cables, multi-device chargers that can power up your Apple Watch plus your iPhone and AirPods, chargers that are built for portability and travel, designer models that look great at home or in the office, and handy Apple Watch power banks.
While battery life has improved with the most recent Watch launches, particularly the Apple Watch 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3, you will still find yourself in need of recharging between one and two days.
We’ve tested a lot and selected our favorite Apple Watch chargers here.

Every Apple Watch comes with the company’s Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable. At $29 / £29 it’s not overly expensive to buy a spare or replacement, but there are more able multifunction Watch chargers available, as well as much cheaper simple cables that we would steer clear of but which we have investigated to see if we can find one we can recommend. First we start our best Apple Watch charger roundup with these simple models, and then we test the more functional and better-designed alternatives. Pros

Apple ships its Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable with its Watch Series 7 and later models, including the Watch Series 8/9/10/11, SE 3 and Watch Ultra. (Earlier Apple Watch SE models and Series 6 and earlier Watches shipped with the Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable that lacks the fast-charging function.)
Both charging cables are Apple white and a meter long. The latest version features an enhanced charging puck that also works with the case of the AirPods Pro 2 &amp; 3 and AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation.
The 7.5W Fast Charger Cable can charge 33% faster than the older 5W cable—charging a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in just 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will support eight hours of sleep tracking.
Without fast charge, it takes about 1.5 hours to charge an Apple Watch to 80%, and about 2.5 hours to 100%.
Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger, like you’d use to charge an iPhone; find our best iPhone chargers for a wider choice that the plain Apple 20W charger.
While you can still buy the older Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable, there’s little benefit as the newer Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable is backwards compatible with older Watch models, looks the same, and is the same price. You can use the old cable on a later Watch but obviously without fast charging. Pros

Apple’s official Watch Charger is fast and reliable but expensive compared to the knock-off Watch chargers you can find online. This is a shame as having a spare in your bag or lying around at home is useful given the Watch’s pretty dreadful battery life.
Usually there is a trusted third-party provider with an alternative to Apple’s simple charging cable but we could find none for the Apple Watch that were cheaper than the Apple version. We know that the Satechi USB-C Fast Charging Cable for Apple Watch is trustworthy as it’s from one of our favorite brands, but it’s actually pricier than the Apple—so why bother, unless you prefer the shorter cable?
There are some great third-party Apple Watch charging stands and adapters—many of which we review below. But you are taking a chance (albeit a very affordable chance) by picking a cheapo simple Watch charger from Amazon, Temu or other online retailers. We bought one from Amazon that frayed its cable sitting in a bag for a few weeks. If you must, then scan the user reviews but we can’t vouch that the good ones are genuine and others often state problems with durability and extremely slow charging. You spent a bunch on your Apple Watch so why risk it going up in flames by saving a few bucks on a spare charger? Pros

Small enough to fit in your pocket, this little 5W Watch charger from Satechi can plug straight into a USB-C charger or a USB-C charging port—for example, the Thunderbolt on your MacBook or iPad, a USB-C car charger, or USB-C output power bank.
As we all know, it’s not only the Apple Watch with a weak battery. This portable Watch Charger can also be used to charge AirPods in a compatible case.
When you get an alert telling you that your Watch battery is fading, you don’t always have your meter-long Apple charging cable with you but you are likely nearer a USB-C power point, and this little Watch charger can live at the bottom of your backpack for when you need it most. Pros

The Nimble Watch charging stand can fast-charge the Watch (Series 7 and later), and weighing just 3.2oz (91g) is portable, too. It is made from sustainable plant-based aloe leather.
The magnetic charging module allows the Watch to be raised to work either lying flat or in Nightstand mode. It ships with a separate 5-foot (1.5m) USB-C but requires a USB-C wall charger. Belkin An alternative is the larger (3.8 x 3.8 x 0.63 inches) and heavier (6.8oz) Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch, which is a long name for a fairly simple square, rubberized Apple Watch charging stand. It’s a little more expensive ($59.99), too, but it is available in white as well as black. Its built-in 4-foot (1.2m) USB-C cable wraps neatly around the underside of the dock, so keeping your space clutter-free. There’s a precision dial on the bottom of the dock to raise the puck height depending on the size of your Watch.
Alternatively, you can save money by buying one of the simple Apple Watch stands that require you to connect your Watch charging cable into the basic stand. Pros

If you own an Apple Watch there is a high possibility that you also own an iPhone, so why not have one versatile charger that can power up both Apple devices at the same time. Here are some of the favorites we have tested. Pros

USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included
Twelve South has triumphed with this pocketable 2-in-1 charger that can handle iPhone and Apple Watch (or Watch and AirPods), charging the two devices simultaneously.
It is fully Apple certified, so fast wirelessly charges the Watch at 5W and the iPhone at 15W. The Watch can’t be charged faster, although you can find 25W wireless chargers for the iPhone.
But its wonder is its clever, dinky foldable size and MacBook-like styling. Unfurl the charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed. You can even fold 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nightstand mode. Flip it round, and you can set the iPhone in landscape StandBy mode.
It chips with a super-compact 30W USB-C wall charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads: US, UK, EU and AU/NZ.
The ButterFly is also our favorite Apple Watch travel charger, but it works back at base just as well. Twelve South You can buy a different (a little pricier at $99.99) version in six different colors—the Twelve South ButterFly SE uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe, so also charges at 15W, but doesn’t ship with a wall charger. Its not metal like the original Butterfly but at least with its color choices (Black, White, Pink, Coastal Blue, Iridescent, Midnight Plum) it resembles more a butterfly than a moth. Pros

Very similar to the Twelve South ButterFly, reviewed above, the Native Union Voyage is a touch larger but also a little lighter. In the same way, it’s a superb travel charger for iPhones after version 12 and Apple Watches. It can fast charge both as it uses 15W Qi2 for iPhone magnetic wireless charging (compared to the ButterFly’s 15W MagSafe but the same Qi2 standard as the ButterFly SE) and 5W for Apple Watch. AirPods can be charged on the Watch part depending on your charging needs.
It is so compact that it will easily fit in your pocket or get lost at the bottom of your backpack—the included pouch is handy in this regard, and something we hoped would be included with the ButterFly.
Like the ButterFly SE (but not the original ButterFly that ships with a 30W USB-C charger) it doesn’t come with a wall charger so you’ll need to add your own. And it is priced the same as the ButterFly SE.
It seems a shame to just compare this very neat 2-in-1 charger to the similar chargers that came before it. It does beat the Twelve South chargers in two respects. We think the Voyage will likely show less wear than the others as its silicone cover looks more hardy. And we like the fact you can just push out the Watch charging module from the back rather than risking your fingernail on the ButterFly’s notch.
Take a look at the Voyage and the ButterFly and ButterFly SE, and make your choice. You won’t be disappointed with any of these dinky and cleverly designed 2-in-1 chargers. Pros

Compact and low-level in an elegant organic shape, the bulb-like charging stand is made from at least 60% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic and has pleasingly soft edges and a texture that makes you stroke it longingly.
The chrome Watch-charging pad sticks out from the back of the stand, and can’t be folded in when not in use, as is possible with some compact multi-device chargers such as the Anker 3-in-1 Cube. It features fast wireless charging for both Watch and iPhone. While it lacks an AirPods charging module like the 3-in-1 charging stations reviewed here, you can charge the AirPods wireless charging case on the top when the charging pad is flat and not charging your iPhone.

Belkin created not one but two UltraCharge Pro Convertible chargers; see also the review below. Both fold up to create a pocketable charging pad and can be unfolded to make a viewing stand. Only this version—they’re both called the same thing so bear with me—can charge both iPhone and Watch when partially folded up.
While not as design-mag gorgeous as the BoostCharge Pro Charging Dock reviewed above, the super-portable UltraCharge Pro Convertible is a foldable compact design marvel nonetheless.
Belkin designates its 15W iPhone chargers as “BoostCharge” and its 25W models as “UltraCharge”. Both will charge the Apple Watch at the same 5W but owners of the iPhone 16 and 17 series will cut around 15 minutes off their charging time with the 25W variety. Pros

It’s got the same name and near identical functions and technical specification as the Belkin UltraCharge Pro Convertible reviewed above, so the choice is all yours and may come down to price. This slightly pricier version is classier with its chrome bar and maybe that’s why Apple chose to sell this model in its Store. It’s also a bit heavier, making the cheaper version better suited to travel.
As the Watch-charging module is folded away under the pad, you can’t charge your Watch while it’s in Pad mode as you can with its non-identical twin. Pros

We list this elegant charging stand as a 2-in-1 because it can charge two types of Apple device: the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, you could argue that it’s a 3-in-1 as it has dual Watch charging pads for families or offices with more than one Apple wearable and can therefore charge two separate devices at the same time.
For such households this charger will help eliminate the need for messy individual charging cables. Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone/AirPod chargers
As well as owning an Apple Watch and iPhone, a fair few of us have further swelled Apple’s coffers by buying AirPods. These are the 3-in-1 chargers that we have tested and approve for simultaneously charging Apple Watch, Apple iPhone and Apple AirPods (with a wireless charging case). Pros

If you’ve got an Apple Watch, chances are you also own an iPhone and maybe a set of AirPods, too. Here’s where a charging station, which can power up all three devices simultaneously, becomes essential if you want to rid yourself of a snake’s nest of cables.
Previously, 3-in-1 chargers were limited to 15W wireless charging either via Apple’s MagSafe or Qi2. Apple’s own iPhone MagSafe Charger has alone been able to charge iPhone 16 and later at 25W. The new Qi2 25W standard, however, means you can get the fastest magnetic charging in a stand without needing to rig it with Apple’s charging puck. In our real-world tests using the iOS 26 beta on our iPhone 16 Pro, we saw actual charging times from 0 to 50 percent of 30-35 minutes, measurably faster than 15W MagSafe.
As with the 25W MagSafe, Qi2 25W requires at least an iPhone 16 running iOS 26 to hit the top wireless charging speed. It and this stand is backwards compatible with older iPhones going back to the iPhone 12 but is pegged back at Qi2’s older 15W limit for those iPhones.
Here we are just as interested in the UltraCharge Pro’s Apple Watch-charging prowess and this is as fast as it gets at 5W.
The base is wrapped in a beautifully soft-touch silicone, while the bar that holds the iPhone and Watch chargers look great in a shiny chrome finish. It’s not the highest stand, but the iPhone charging pad is highly adjustable— up to 70 degrees in portrait or landscape—so it can be angled as you desire. Pros

The HiRise 3 Deluxe (available at Apple) can wirelessly charge three devices—iPhone 12/13/14/15/16/17 (but not SE), Apple Watch 7, 8, 9, SE and Ultra, and Apple AirPods (2nd and 3rd gen AirPods, and all AirPods Pro). The AirPods-charging Qi wireless pad can alternatively be used to charge any iPhone from iPhone 8 up.
The iPhone 15W, Watch 5W and Qi pad 7.5W charging points allow for fast charging, but that 15W iPhone charger is now bested by Qi2 25W chargers as found on the Belkin UltraCharge Pro 3-in-1 stand reviewed above.
The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, and the iPhone in iOS 17’s StandBy mode. You can angle the iPhone by up to 35 degrees. Pros

If you own an Apple Watch it’s a fair bet that you also have an iPhone, and, go on admit it, some AirPods, too—you’re well invested into the Apple ecosystem.
This 3-in-1 charging station from Journey has a tiltable MagSafe-certified pad (15W) for all iPhones 12/13/14/15, plus a Qi charger for AirPods that have a wireless charging case.
Important to us here, though, is the Apple Watch charger at the back, which can fast-charge your Apple wearable.
The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is similar and features a tiltable Watch charger at the front rather than the back. If you want a 3-in-1 fast charging stand in white, then pick this Journey stand or the OtterBox 3-in-1 reviewed below; if you prefer black, go for the Charcoal Belkin UltraCharge Pro.
There is a cheaper version, the Journey Trio 3-in-1 Charging Station, which features a handy detachable Watch charger that you can slip into your pocket and plug into a USB-C charger, including your MacBook, away from the base unit. While that is a neat feature (and might save you $40 on a standalone Watch adapter) the MagSafe pad is only compatible so charges the iPhone at 7.5W and the Watch charger is slower than the one featured on the Trio Ultra 3-in-1.

The first 3-in-1 device charger based on the fast MagSafe-like 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging tech, the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station not only boosts wireless charging speeds that match Apple’s MagSafe but wraps up everything into a solid, foldable and compact yet flexible design. Apple Watch fast charging is the cream on the top.
Foldable and super compact, the Anler MagGo Wireless Charging Station is a great portable option for your travels. The Watch-charging module neatly folds into the base of the charging station. It’s just as great as a permanent charger at home.
We also like Anker’s 3-in-1 Cube, reviewed below—but while it’s gorgeous, it is heavier than the MagGo and doesn’t feature Watch fast charging.
If you can live without the MagSafe wireless charging iPhone stand element, we are rather in love with another Apple Watch charger from the same company, which is also a power bank: the Anker MagGo 10K Power Bank For Apple Watch, reviewed below in our Best Apple Watch Power Banks reviews. Pros

Belkin’s Boost Up Charge Pro Wireless Charging Pad 3-in-1 charger (available at Apple) is the fastest way you can wirelessly charge both your Apple Watch and iPhone (12/13/14/15/16-series models), plus AirPods that come in a wireless charging case. It’s a flat pad so the iPhone charges lying down rather than visible as it would be on a stand.
It boasts both Watch fast charging (7.5W) and iPhone MagSafe fast charging (15W). The included 20W USB-C wall charger is a little underpowered if charging all three devices simultaneously. A 30W or 40W charger would better handle that situation.
The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, but because the iPhone lies flat you can’t take advantage of iOS 17’s StandBy mode. The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is a better option if you want to view your iPhone while it’s charging—and it also comes with a more powerful 40W power supply.
The magnetic charging module features a precision dial that can adjust the height for the best Watch, depending on the screen size. Pros

Charge your Apple Watch plus your other small Apple gadgets with this dinky (if weighty) designer 3-in-1 cube that is MagSafe certified so can wirelessly charge an iPhone at 15W.

Matching the Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe in terms of charging speed, the OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station is a super-fast iPhone/Watch/AirPods charger with a small footprint—indeed, it’s a little smaller than its rival.
The charging points for iPhone and Apple Watch are fully certified—iPhone 15W and Watch 5W. At 5W, the lower Qi pad is slower than the Twelve South.
We prefer the HiRise 3 Deluxe for its tilting iPhone MagSafe pad and more flexible Watch module. But if the white color option fits your decor better than the black-only HiRise, the OtterBox 3-in-1 is a great choice. Best Apple Watch travel chargers

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld The iPad mini isn’t on the same update cadence as Apple’s other tablets. Where the iPad and iPad Air generally get annual refreshes, and the iPad Pro gets a new model every 18 months, the iPad mini can often go years without an update. As such, the current iPad mini, which was released in October 2024, isn’t expected to get an update until later this year. But it could be worth the wait.
2026 iPad mini: At a glance
A18 Pro, N1, C1X
Possible OLED display
Same design and cameras
Same price 2026 iPad mini: Performance and specs A18 Pro chip
8GB RAM
C1X modem
N1 chip for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6
Since it hasn’t been updated in over a year, the 2026 iPad mini will likely get several chip upgrades. With the current iPad mini sporting an A17 Pro with 8GB of RAM and Apple Intelligence support, the 2026 iPad mini is expected to jump to the A18 Pro, according to reports.
The A18 Pro has the same number of CPU cores as the A17 Pro (10), but the chip optimizations make the A18 Pro a faster CPU performer. The A18 Pro is available with a 6-core GPU, which is one more GPU core than the A17 Pro. So it’ll benchmark a little better than the existing model but won’t bring a huge speed bump.
With the iPhone 17 lineup, Apple released a new N1 chip for wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread). Apple is expected to gradually roll out the new chip to the iPad line throughout 2026 and 2027, including the iPad mini. We also expect the cellular version of the iPad mini to get Apple’s C1X modem. The A18 Pro chip will be the main new feature in the upcoming iPad mini Apple 2026 iPad mini: Design and display

The new iPad mini has had the same design since its 2021 overhaul, and the 2026 model is expected to keep the same overall look. There’s a strong possibility of new colors, however. Apple currently offers blue, purple, starlight, and space gray, following the previous model’s pink, purple, starlight, and space gray.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[How cheap is a cheap MacBook, really?]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3064445/how-cheap-is-a-cheap-macbook-really.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld There’s probably not long to go now. Based on Apple’s looming “global experience” on March 4, dwindling stock of the M1 MacBook Air, and a near-universal consensus among pundits and leakers, the much-anticipated cheap MacBook will be with us in the next week or two. But we still don’t know the answer to the key question.
Exactly how cheap are we talking about?
Because here’s the thing: As a general rule, Apple doesn’t do cheap. It prefers to focus on the premium end of the market where the margins are higher, and it can get more mileage out of its luxury brand. Conversely, dabbling in the budget market risks tarnishing that brand: if everyone can afford an iPhone, owning an iPhone stops being a status symbol.
From the iPhone 5c and Apple Watch SE to the AirPods 4 and Mac mini, fans have often got excited about the imminent launch of a “cheap” Apple product, then been disappointed when it turns out to sit roughly on the border of budget and solidly affordable mid-market. They’re (mostly) good products perfectly capable of delivering value for money. But that isn’t quite the same as being out-and-out cheap.
Indeed, despite rising costs of living in the U.S. and several major international markets, Apple appears less inclined than ever to cater to buyers on a strict budget. This time last year, it released the iPhone 16e, which was certainly more affordable than its siblings but cost $170 more than the iPhone SE it nominally replaced. The new “e” phone felt like a signal that Apple no longer wished to participate (or pretend to participate) in the budget smartphone market. And the iPhone 17e, which we expect to launch in a matter of days as well, is unlikely to reverse that decision.
So what would be a reasonable asking price for a MacBook with an A19 iPhone chip? For comparison purposes, let’s consider the rest of Apple’s current range. At the top, the MacBook Pro starts at $1,599 for the 14-inch model with an M5 chip, while the MacBook Air starts at $999 for the 13-inch model with an M4 chip. Even if the cheap MacBook has the same 256GB of storage and 16GB of RAM as those models (which isn’t guaranteed), it’ll cost less than both of those, so we can start subtracting from a thousand.
At the other end, the most interesting comparator is the M1 MacBook Air. Apple once sold this machine for $999 long past its prime, and it continued to be sold by Walmart until very recently. In 2024, Walmart sold the M1 Air for $699, but the price fell over the months to $599, $549 and finally all the way down to $499 on Cyber Monday last year, so this gives us a floor.
Now that we’ve established that cheap is between $499 and $999, let’s drill down deeper. The budget MacBook will be targeted at customers who need to do light work on the go, and that’s veering into iPad territory. The entry-level and mini versions of the iPad don’t quite fit that target audience, but the iPad Air is about right. That starts at $599. Chuck in the Magic Keyboard, and we’re up to $868. I’d expect our MacBook’s price tag to sit somewhere between those two numbers, hopefully closer to the lower end.
And this is more or less where pundits have ended up. Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg, says the budget MacBook will cost “well under $1,000.” Others have more ambitiously claimed it could start as low as $599 to compete in the popular Chromebook market, and maybe Apple will manage this by making heavy compromises on the specs and feature set. But I’d be surprised by that, given how recently Apple fans were expected to part with the same amount for a five-year-old MacBook Air. Based on our experience with the transition from the iPhone SE 3 to the iPhone S16e, I’d expect the A19 Pro MacBook to cost somewhere between $699 and $799, with a discount of $50 or $100 for education buyers.
Of course, there are plenty of customers out there who’d be delighted if Apple went lower. Our colleagues at PCWorld have an entire article recommending laptops under $500, and this includes one pick under $300 and another under $200. If Apple truly wanted to smash the ultra-budget Chromebook market, it would be targeting numbers like that. But it won’t. And the sooner we accept this, the better.

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld According to rumors, 2026 is shaping up to be a huge year for the Mac, starting in just a couple of weeks with Apple’s first event (or “experience”) of the year. Along with the usual faster chips, Apple reportedly has new tricks up its sleeve in 2026, with several new features that will have Mac users everywhere saying, “Finally!” Here are four major overdue announcements we expect to arrive this year.
A budget MacBook
iPhone fans have long pined for a truly affordable MacBook priced below the $999 MacBook Air that isn’t just an older model with a cut-rate price. That dream machine may finally arrive in just two short weeks. On March 4, Apple will hold a series of “experiences” in New York, London, and Shanghai, and the star is expected to be the first-ever low-cost MacBook. After tackling the mid-range market with the MacBook Air, Apple reportedly wants to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops, with a new laptop that could be as cheap as $599. Apple will reportedly use an A18 Pro or A19 Pro iPhone chip, and it will likely have a smaller screen than the Air and possibly fewer USB ports. But it will be powerful enough for everyday tasks and light work. For a lot of users, that’s all that’s needed.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066931/dwindling-m1-air-stock-points-to-imminent-release-of-a-budget-macbook.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple’s long-rumored cheap MacBook appears to have come a step closer to launch, with the discovery that Walmart has stopped selling new units of the low-cost M1 MacBook Air.
As first reported by PC Mag, searching for the late-2020 machine on the U.S. site with the “new” filter checked brings up three buying options: the 256GB in Space Gray or gold, and a listing for the 512GB model, which hasn’t been available since 2024. All three now show as out of stock for shipping, and the reporter was able to find just one store in his local area with units for pickup. I had a similar experience. I’m out of luck, and they’re out of stock.
David Price / Foundry (As a side note, I’ve been unable to find new units of the M1 Air in any other stores close to me, including Amazon. If you check the price-comparison table below, you’ll see if there are any in your location. If the table isn’t showing up at all, that means you’re out of luck, too.)
Retailer Price Check Product Price It isn’t clear how long Walmart has been short of stock for this machine, but we know it was on sale for the bargain price of $549 as recently as mid-December. As it’s unlikely that Walmart just happened to run out of stock after two years, it seems Apple and Walmart have decided to wind down sales.
While the decision could be related to cost-cutting measures due to memory prices ballooning, this timing adds credence to the rumors of a cheap MacBook expected within the next two weeks. Apple recently announced global “experiences” on March 4, and it’s widely rumored that it will announce a series of new entries in its iPhone, iPad, and MacBook lines in the days leading up to that. Rumors about the new MacBook claim it will use an A18 Pro iPhone chip and cost around $699, both reasons to stop selling these M1 models. Whatever the truth, we should find out soon.

      <title><![CDATA[The retro iPod that never was]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066316/the-retro-ipod-that-never-was.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple is known for being secretive about what goes on inside its offices, whether it’s about upcoming products or things from the past. Still, from time to time, we get a glimpse into internal projects that were never meant to see the light of day. What if we told you that Apple once considered launching a “retro iPod”?
Thanks to newly published material by former Apple designer Jon Stoa, we now have a fascinating glimpse into never-before-seen marketing concepts. They not only show scrapped plans for the 2007 iPhone launch, but also concepts for what would have been a special edition iPod classic.
An iPod inspired by the 1984 Macintosh
On his resume webpage, which includes several images for ads, packaging elements, and marketing images created while working at Apple, Stoa shares some of the unreleased projects he worked on at Apple between 2006 and 2008. The most intriguing is the concept for a limited edition “retro iPod,” which would be designed to look like it came straight out of 1984.
The idea was heavily based on a growing trend of nostalgia, even 20 years ago. The material imagines an iPod based on the design of the original Macintosh with a beige finish, classic typography, and the rainbow Apple logo on the back. He writes that the device “would draw from both the present and the past to make a statement about the role of Apple and the iPod in culture, both now and then.” Apple proposed a series of names for its retro “1984” iPod. Jon Stoa Suggested names included iPod retro, iPod rewind, iPod beta, and iPod backspace, all rendered in Apple Garamond, the typography used in Apple’s marketing materials at the time.
The concept went far beyond a vintage design. The marketing material proposed preloading the iPod with some music videos from the 1980s and even classic arcade games such as Pac-Man. Distribution would have been limited, with the retro iPod only available at Apple Stores and selected boutique partners.
There’s no evidence Apple ever developed prototypes for the retro iPod. The materials appear to be unused design and marketing explorations rather than a cancelled product.
Still, the fact that someone inside Apple considered making a vintage edition of the iPod (which was at its peak in 2006) is fascinating. A retro iPod is unlikely to happen now, but it would make an intriguing device. Jon Stoa Could a retro iPod happen in 2026?
Apple officially killed the iPod brand in 2022 when it discontinued the iPod touch, but the more classic iPod nano and iPod shuffle disappeared years earlier. Even so, some people are still calling for the return of the iPod in some form.
Some fans would instantly buy an iPod classic, while others would like a reimagined version of the iPod that blends today’s technologies with the essence of the original iPod.
If Apple were to revisit the idea today, it likely wouldn’t be a straight reissue. Instead, we could imagine a compact device the size of the iPod classic, but built with today’s materials and components. A modern OLED or mini-LED display, haptic feedback to simulate the tactile feel of the Click Wheel, expanded storage options, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support, and deep integration with Apple Music.
Whether Apple would embrace this idea of looking back at its hardware is another question. The company typically prefers to move forward and rarely celebrates milestones such as product anniversaries. But it’s hard to imagine a limited-edition device like this not selling out instantly. The Apple Store cube on 5th Avenue in New York City could have had a light projection show ahead of the iPhone’s launch. Jon Stoa The canceled iPhone event
Stoa’s material also sheds light on Apple’s pre-launch strategy for the original iPhone.
According to the documents, Apple had considered hosting another press event on June 26, 2007, just three days before the iPhone officially went on sale. The event was to be held at The California Theatre in San Jose. Attendees would have received an iPhone-shaped gift card to spend on the iTunes Store.
However, the event never happened.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[No, Apple won’t drop USB-C from the iPhone 18]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066138/no-apple-wont-drop-usb-c-from-the-iphone-18.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Most iPhone fans are currently focused on the imminent launch of the iPhone 17e, which could be here in a matter of days. But one dubious rumor doing the rounds on social media right now concerns a flagship phone from the next generation. It’s just a shame that it’s almost certainly wrong.
This TikTok video, which at the time of writing has been viewed more than 17 million times, purports to show the charging port of the iPhone 18. (Or “iPhone18,” as it’s labelled by the clearly knowledgeable maker.) But rather than the USB-C port, which has been used on all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 15 in 2023, the animation shows something more akin to the MagSafe connector that appears on newer MacBooks. This video might look cool, but it’s not going to happen. TikTok The charging cable, which has a rather nice black braided cord, attaches via a magnetic connection. When it’s in place a green LED lights up on the charger head, and a small green lightning bolt is shown at the bottom of the previously blank phone screen. (Never mind that iPhones don’t behave like this; it’s the least of our worries.) It looks very similar to the MagSafe cable on my 2021 MacBook Pro, except with three pins instead of five and a chunkier body.
Now, the video doesn’t list its sources; we don’t get the usual “supply-chain sources” or “people with knowledge of the matter.” It’s just an animation. So in some ways it’s quite difficult to refute: where did this information come from? Who said this was likely? Is this simply a concept that an illustrator dreamed up, like this animation from the same channel showing possible iPhone 18 Pro colors?
Whatever the video’s intention, it’s getting major traction from viewers who think it’s real. A quick browse through a handful of the 9,700-odd reveals viewer after viewer complaining about Apple’s foolishness in doing this, or the impracticality of the design. A few appear to be Android fans mocking iPhone users for their misfortune. I couldn’t find any pointing out that this is extraordinarily unlikely to happen.
Because, as several commenters argue, it wouldn’t be a practical solution. It would disconnect very easily, and unlike on the MacBook, disconnecting easily isn’t necessary to protect it from a specific type of accident. It would annoy customers and accessories makers. And it could create problems with the EU, who mandated USB-C connectors on all smartphones sold in its territory.
What may have happened is that someone has got confused between MagSafe on the iPhone and MagSafe on the Mac. They’re both charging standards that use a magnetic connection to keep the charging points in place, but in most other respects they’re totally different. (For example, the phone’s magnetic connection is stronger so that it remains connected if you nudge the device, whereas the laptop is designed to detach if you trip on the wire.) The iPhone 17 already has the phone version of MagSafe, and the iPhone 18 will too, but that doesn’t mean it will have the Mac version as well. If nothing else, it would be enormously confusing.
Whereas the iPhone 17e is expected to be here in time for Apple’s “experience” on March 4, the first 18-series iPhones won’t arrive until September. And the actual iPhone 18, the cheaper baseline model, might not turn up until the following spring.

      <title><![CDATA[Apple set to launch ‘at least five new products’ by March 4]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3068255/apple-set-to-launch-at-least-five-new-products-by-march-4.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple has invited the press to what it calls an “experience” on March 4, in the middle of next week. But based on the unusual terminology and timing, analysts believe Apple won’t save everything for that date and will rather launch new products throughout the week.
And now a new report has revealed more details of what we can expect next week. In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Marc Gurman claims Apple will launch at least five new products, and that these “could span hardware, software, and chips.” Gurman believes any or all of the following products could arrive before Apple’s “experience” kicks off at 9am ET next Wednesday:
Low-cost MacBook
iPhone 17e
M5 MacBook Air
M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro
Entry-level iPad
iPad Air
Mac Studio
Apple Studio Display
Of these five-plus announcements for the week of March 2, Gurman is most confident that we’re going to get a low-cost MacBook and the iPhone 17e, although he says the latter might even make it out the door before then. Its predecessor was released in mid-February 2025, and one source who contacted Macworld at the start of this month believed the 17e would arrive exactly a year after the 16e on February 19, which we now know was a mistake.)
The budget MacBook, Gurman says, “is the only thing in Apple’s imminent pipeline that actually looks new,” referring to the bold colors in both the laptop and the invitation artwork. Indeed the hands-on event on March 4 wouldn’t be happening without this product, he argues, cattily observing that “it’s not worth flying in so-called influencers to try out a product if the only difference is a faster chip.”
So hardware and chips, check. It’s not clear what Gurman’s “software” prediction refers to, but presumably it’s a round of 26.3.1 updates to support all the new products.
Beyond the iPhone 17e and the low-cost MacBook, Gurman identifies four further products or product groups that are coming in spring 2026. There are two iPads on the way (the latest version of the standard iPad with an A18 or A19 processor, and the M4 iPad Air), and new models of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. The timing fits historically for the MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro “is overdue by months,” and Gurman’s supply-chain sources indicate that the iPads are ready to go too, so there’s a good chance that some or all of these products will be revealed next week.
And it doesn’t end there. The Mac Studio is in line for a refresh in the first half of 2026, as is the Apple Studio Display. The new display, Gurman says, is ready to ship, while the new desktop isn’t far behind. So next week could be full of excitement, even if we don’t get an actual Apple event.]]></description>

      <title><![CDATA[How long Macs &amp; MacBooks last: Lifespan, support &amp; when to upgrade]]></title>
      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/673939/this-is-how-long-macs-and-macbooks-last.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Macs have a high price so it’s understandable that many Mac users will want to put off replacing them for as long as they can. But just how long should you expect a Mac to last? Similarly, in order to save money, you may be considering buying an older, used or refurbished Mac. Is that 2018 MacBook Pro for $300/£300 a good deal, or would you be better off spending a bit more on a newer model? The question of whether a Mac is too old depends on hardware durability and software support, both of which we will address in this article. Hardware: Macs and MacBooks are built to last, with most users getting five to eight years of reliable performance. Beyond that though, Apple gives Macs that have been off sale for five to seven years “vintage” and eventually “obsolete” status, at which point opportunities for repairs become limited. Software: Software support also plays a crucial role, especially unsupported Macs can be vulnerable to security issues. Apple typically provides macOS updates for Macs up to around eight years old, but that window is narrowing with the company ending support for Intel Macs in the near future. With Apple transitioning fully to its own silicon and phasing out support for Intel models, knowing how long your Mac will receive updates – and when it’s time to upgrade – is more important than ever. Updated February 2026 with details of the macOS Big Sur and Catalina updates and news that a new battery-preservation tool coming in the next update to macOS Tahoe (macOS 26.4) will allow users to cap charging between 80-100% which should extend battery life. Is your Mac too old?
We know that Macs cost a fair bit of money and not everyone has the luxury of upgrading every few years. But at what point is it time to consider upgrading your Mac?
Is the hardware to old? One factor to consider is the age at which most Macs start to experience issues, such as random shutdowns and degraded batteries that no longer hold their charge. Unfortunately, at one point repairing your Mac or MacBook will no longer be a viable option and you will need to look for a replacement. There is a point at which Apple stops providing the required parts for Macs, rating them either obsolete and vintage. Once a Mac is considered vintage (you can find a list of vintage and obsolete Macs below) we would recommend that you upgrade it.
Is the software to old? Another issue with aging Macs is that the software you need may not run on it. You may find that your Mac cannot update to the latest version of macOS (Apple’s Mac operating system software), but it’s even more concerning if Apple is no longer issuing security updates to the version of macOS you can run – because that make you open to malware and security vulnerabilities. We will explain which versions of macOS are supported – and for how much longer, below.
If the following apply, it is probably the case that your Mac has reached the end of its useful life:
Apple no longer supports the latest version of the software it runs (which could leave you vulnerable).
The apps you need to use no longer run on it.
The Mac struggles to perform the tasks you need it to – especially as you can’t update the RAM and other components.
Something breaks and is too expensive to fix, or the parts aren’t available.
The Mac is becoming unreliable. Unexpected shutdowns are becoming commonplace and you’ve tried everything to fix the problem to no avail. Apple Software support: Which Macs are supported by macOS updates – and why it matters…
Only the most recent version of macOS gets feature updates, but Apple usually maintains the last two or three versions of the macOS with bug fixes and important security updates, ensuring that the latest version of Safari will run, and that Apple Services, such as iCloud, are fully supported
Apple currently provides support for these versions of macOS, in terms of security updates:
macOS Tahoe
macOS Sequoia
macOS Sonoma
Since Tahoe arrived on September 15, 2025, Apple has continued to issue security updates for Sequoia and Sonoma. Sonoma’s predecessor, macOS Ventura, last had a security update in August 2025.
On that basis, if your Mac is able to run macOS Tahoe, Sequoia, or Sonoma, you should be able to be confident that Apple will keep an eye on any security vulnerabilities and other problems with these operating systems. You can see which Macs that includes in the next section of this article.
If your Mac is running an older version of the Mac operating system, you will find yourself out in the cold when it comes to essential security updates to Apple’s software. Read: The latest version of macOS your Mac can run. That said, there has been a surprise update to macOS Big Sur and macOS Catalina: On February 2 2026, Apple issued a update to fix a FaceTime and Messages Certificate in order to ensure that those communication tools remained operational on the older systems. This doesn’t mean that Apple is offering security updates to those versions of macOS. Another reason why must run a supported macOS version is that if it is too old you may also find that your other Apple products aren’t compatible with your Mac. For example, without the latest security update, you may no longer be able to use Apple Pay or other means to pay for services online, for example. And if you want to sync your iPad or iPhone with your Mac (rather than using iCloud) you will need a recent version of macOS. Since Catalina, syncing is done via the Finder, rather than iTunes. If you can’t run macOS Catalina you will need at least iTunes 12.8.2.3 and at least Mac OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan) or your Mac will not recognize your iPhone or iPad. Are Intel Macs supported by Apple? Apple There are a small number of 2018/2019 Intel-powered Macs currently supported by macOS Tahoe, Sequoia and Sonoma, but support for Intel Macs will be ending soon. Apple has revealed that the version of macOS that launches in September 2026 will not support any Intel Macs. However, that doesn’t mean that support for Intel Macs ends in September 2026. Apple will continue to support macOS Sequoia for at least one more year and macOS Tahoe until 2028, so a small number of Intel Macs should receive support until September 2028. If your Macs isn’t in the list of supported Macs below, it won’t receive important security updates: Which Macs are supported by Apple in 2026
Apple’s support for the Mac lineup is centered on its transition to Apple silicon, with the current operating system, macOS 26 Tahoe, serving as the final time Intel-based machines will receive the latest macOS update.
Apple generally provides full feature updates for the most recent macOS version and security updates for the previous two.
The following versions are actively supported with security patches: macOS 26 Tahoe: The current flagship version, released on September 15, 2025.
macOS 15 Sequoia: Released in 2024.
macOS 14 Sonoma: Released in 2023.
Macs supported by macOS Tahoe macOS Tahoe supports the following Macs, including a small number of Intel-powered models. We expect that Apple will continue to support Tahoe with security updates until fall 2028:
MacBook Air M1 and later
MacBook Pro 16-inch from 2019 and later
MacBook Pro 12-inch from 2018 and later
Mac mini M1 and later
iMac from mid 2020 and later
Mac Pro from 2019 and later
Mac Studio (all models)
Macs supported by macOS Sequoia 2024’s Sequoia supports the following Macs, including a number of Intel-based models. We expect that Apple will continue to support Sequoia with security updates until fall 2027. MacBook Air from 2020 and later
MacBook Pro from 2018 and later

Oldest: 2017 iMac Pro
This means that the oldest Macs supported right now is the 2017 iMac Pro, but only while Apple still supports macOS Sequoia security updates.
The next Macs to lose support will be those that cannot update from macOS Sonoma, for which support will likely end in September 2026. At this time, the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air will lose support.
The 2018 MacBook Pro and Mac mini, and the 2019 iMac should continue to get support until fall 2027 as they can run macOS Sequoia. Which Macs aren’t supported by macOS? macOS Ventura is no longer supported by Apple software updates
Apple Support for 2022’s macOS Ventura has ended now that Apple has released macOS Tahoe.
This means that, aside from the iMac Pro, no Macs from 2017 are supported with security updates. The following Macs can not be updated to macOS Sonoma from macOS Ventura: 2017 MacBook
2017 MacBook Pro
2017 iMac Read: Can my Mac run Ventura?
When Apple introduced Sequoia in 2023 it dropped support for macOS Monterey, meaning that Macs that couldn’t update from Monterey could no longer get security updates.
The following Macs couldn’t update from macOS Monterey to Ventura: iMac 2015
MacBook Air 2017
MacBook Pro 2016
Mac mini 2014 Mac Pro 2013
All other Macs that pre-date those mentioned above are no longer supported by Apple’s software updates.
If your Mac is a decade old then you certainly won’t get security updates for it. In fact, we’d recommend avoiding any Macs from before 2019, in which case you might as well just look at 2020 Macs with Apple’s own processor, rather than Intel, which won’t be supported for much longer. Does it matter if my Mac won’t run a supported macOS?
Once you cannot update your Mac to run a supported version of macOS you are vulnerable to security breaches, which should obviously be a concern. You may also find that you can’t carry out transactions on the internet if you want to pay for things on your out-of-date Mac. It’s also probably that the software you need won’t run on your Mac. Apple and other companies stop supporting older versions of the applications they make, so there could be issues with the versions of the software you are running. If you are experiencing random shutdowns, for example, it could be due to problems with an app you are running – problems that will not be addressed by the developer because that version of the app is no longer supported.
If you want to run fully supported software then you will need to update to a newer version of macOS – and that may mean that you need to update your Mac. Although, there are workarounds to install a new version of macOS on an old Mac if you need to.
Once Apple no longer supports your Macs with operating system updates, it’s probably a good time to replace your Mac. When do Macs become obsolete?
But it’s not just software updates that determine the lifespan of a Mac. It’s also a question of whether it will be possible to fix your Mac should something go wrong with the hardware. Apple has two standards that indicate hardware support is waining: Obsolete or Vintage. The first stage is Vintage: you might be lucky enough to get parts for this Mac, the second is Obsolete: you are out on your own when it comes to any attempt to mend the Mac if it goes wrong. If you look at Apple’s list of Obsolete Macs – those being the Macs that Apple will no longer provide spare parts for – you will see that the company stops providing parts for Macs that it hasn’t sold for more than seven years. In fact, the company may not even provide parts for Macs that haven’t been sold for more than five years (considered Vintage by the company).
This could mean that you won’t be able to get a faulty Mac fixed because the parts aren’t available.
Obsolete Macs
Obsolete Macs are generally Macs that Apple stopped selling more than seven years ago. Once a Mac is in Apple’s obsolete list you have little chance of getting it repaired if something does go wrong. You might be able to find spare parts yourself, but Apple won’t provide them.
You’ll find more details about the exact models on Apple’s US page and the equivalent UK page, but the lists below will give you a general idea.
Apple considers the following Macs and older Obsolete, now including the 2017 MacBook Pro models:
11-inch MacBook Air (early 2015 and older) 12-inch MacBook (2016 and older)
13-inch MacBook Air (early 2015 and older)
13-inch MacBook Pro (2017 and older)
15-inch MacBook Pro (2017 and older)
27-inch iMac (2015 and older)
21.5-inch iMac (2015 and older)
Mac mini (2012 and older) Mac mini Server (2012 and older)
Mac Pro (2010 and older)
Anything predating the Intel switch, obviously. Petter Ahrnstedt Vintage Macs
Apple also has a list of Vintage Macs. These are Macs that Apple stopped selling between five and seven years ago. (If you live in France where a law means you can get support for spare parts for up to seven years after Apple stops selling a Mac).
Apple Authorized Service Providers will repair vintage products, as long as parts are available.
Apple lists the following products as being vintage, now including the 2020 MacBook Air, 2019 MacBook Air, 2019 MacBook Pro and 2019 iMac, and the 2018 Mac mini:
12-inch MacBook (2017)
13-inch MacBook Air (2018, 2019 and 2020)
13-inch MacBook Pro (2017, 2018 &amp; 2019)
15-inch MacBook Pro (2015, 2017, 2018, 2019)
21.5-inch iMac (2013, 2017)
27-inch iMac (2015, 2017 &amp; 2019)
Mac Pro (2012 &amp; 2014)
Mac mini (2014 &amp; 2018)
Based on the above, we’d suggest that if your Mac is more than eight years old, it’s time to look for a new one. And, if you see a 2018 or earlier Mac on sale, it’s not wise to buy it. In fact you will note that there are even 2019 Macs on the vintage list. Read: Why you shouldn’t buy a second hand Mac.
See: Best Mac: Every Apple Mac and MacBook compared How to extend the life of a MacBook Use your MacBook with the screen open for better thermal management. Petter Ahrnstedt Extending the life of your MacBook involves a combination of optimizing software settings, maintaining battery health, and adopting hardware habits that protect the device’s physical integrity.
Battery health: One way to extend the life of a MacBook is to not leave it plugged in all the time. Apple added an Optimize Battery Charging feature in macOS Catalina that uses machine learning to limit charging to help extend battery lifespan by reducing wear from constant full charges. Since the arrival of this feature, users have been asking for the ability to manually set the charge limit below 100 percent. In response, Apple is adding the ability to stop charging between 80-100% in macOS 26.4. Thermal Management: Avoid pushing the machine to the point of overheating. MacBook Pro models feature fans for better cooling during intensive tasks, whereas the fanless MacBook Air may throttle performance to maintain safe temperatures. Using External Displays: If you frequently work at a desk, using your MacBook in “clamshell mode” (with the lid closed) can help organize your space and reduce the footprint on your desk. However, operating the laptop with the lid closed while connected to an external monitor may make it more likely to overheat. Because the MacBook’s chassis and keyboard area often assist in dissipating heat, closing the lid can trap thermal energy that would otherwise escape through the top of the device. This heat buildup is particularly concerning for fanless models like the MacBook Air. Without an internal fan to force air circulation, these models rely entirely on passive cooling, which is less effective when the lid is closed. We recommend using multiple external displays with your Mac, but with the MacBook open to allow for cooling. Security: Ensure you update macOS often and only install applications from the “App Store &amp; Known Developers” to prevent malicious software from compromising your system. Should I fix or upgrade components in my Mac? You may be wondering if spending money to improve your Mac, or fix a hardware problem, might be more savvy than buying a brand new Mac.
If your Mac is in the Obsolete category above and something goes wrong with it then you are going to struggle to get the necessary parts if you wanted to attempt to get it fixed as Apple won’t provide the parts. You might be able to buy an old Mac on eBay or similar and scrap if for the parts, but we’d suggest that it really wouldn’t be worth the effort.
Even if your Mac is in the Vintage list then Apple might be able to provide the required parts, but there is no guarantee. If you are lucky enough to get the part an Apple service provider might even be able to fix the Mac for you – but the cost of the work is likely to be prohibitive.
Similarly, if you are considering adding more RAM, or doubling your storage by adding a new SSD, you will be similarly prohibited because with most modern Macs there is no way to update the hardware.
It’s been years since it was possible to upgrade the RAM in a Mac. Now Apple solders RAM in place and hides components away to make access impossible (or at least impossible if you don’t want to completely destroy your Mac attempting to get to them). With M-series Macs memory, GPU and CPU are all integrated onto the chip, so it is impossible to upgrade them. Nor can you update the SSD as it is soldered onto the motherboard. There are other ways to upgrade your Mac, though. Read: How to upgrade your Mac mini for ideas. Apple repair programs
You might find that the Mac was included in part of a recall due to the issue you are experiencing, in that case, it might be worth enlisting in a repair program. However, if the time period in which Apple was offering the repairs has passed (which is unfortunately likely) then you will still have to find the money for the repair, which again might be prohibitive.
If the Mac you own, or are considering buying would be affected by any of the problems listed below that’s another reason to avoid it. Apple’s current Mac repair programs include:
A recall for 15-inch MacBook Pro units due to a battery fault. September 2015 to February 2017 models affected.
Current service programs: There is a Mac mini service program with a No Power Issue. This relates to the 2023 Mac mini, but specifically devices manufactured between June 16, 2024 to November 23, 2024.
Service programs that have now ended:
There was a keyboard services for some Mac laptops bought since 2016, but this is no longer running.
A 13-inch MacBook Pro backlit service program for models from 2016-2018.
A SSD service program for 13in MacBook Pro models from 2017-2018.
A battery replacement program for 13in MacBook Pros from 2016-2017.
We have more information about Apple’s product recalls and repair programs here. Plus, visit this page for more information on the above repair programs.
Assuming your fault isn’t one of those listed above, you may be faced with a pricy repair bill. We suggest that if your Mac is older than five years then repairing it will not be worth it – unless of course there are important documents or photos on it that you want to retrieve in which case it might be worth looking at how to recover these files or the best software to recover data on your Mac. How long do Macs last?
So, in answer to the question: How long do Macs last? We’d say five to eight years, but beware that you may not be able to replace any faulty parts in a Mac when more than five years have passed since Apple last sold it.
With Apple saying that it will stop support for Intel-powered Macs with the version of macOS that launches at the end of 2026, we recommend that you avoid buying an Intel-powered Mac now.
So, our advice right now is to avoid buying a Mac that is more than five years old – especially if it has Intel inside. And if you haven’t yet updated to the series Apple silicon powered Macs, what are you waiting for!

      <description><![CDATA[I have tested dozens of smart locks over the years for HomeKit Weekly, from the August lock to the latest Level Lock Pro. They all solved the problem of having to fish your keys out, but they never quite solved the problem of “my hands are full.” Even with Home Key, you’d still have to either get your Apple Watch to your lock or pull out your iPhone. Yes, plenty of locks offer various flavors of auto-unlock, but none are perfect and work 100% of the time. That is the problem Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology aims to solve. This week, I am taking a deep look at the Aqara UWB Smart Lock U400.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066403/macos-26-3-might-have-just-confirmed-apples-biggest-march-4-surprises.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld As we have extensively covered, Apple is rumored to soon introduce new products, as the company recently confirmed a special announcement for March 4. Among the expected products are a low-cost MacBook and a new generation of Studio Display.
If you needed more evidence that these products will soon be arriving in stores, here’s proof from Apple itself. Code from macOS 26.3, released last week to the public, confirms the existence of such devices.
As discovered by Macworld, the final build of macOS 26.3 released to the public on February 11 includes kernel extensions (kexts) for three new devices identified as J700, J427, and J527. The codenames match previous reports, including those based on an internal build of iOS 26 leaked last year.
Low-cost MacBook essentially confirmed
J700 is the codename for the rumored new low-cost MacBook. This Mac is expected to be priced lower than the current MacBook Air, and will be the first Apple silicon Mac to be powered by an A-series chip instead of an M-series one.
More specifically, the new entry-level MacBook will reportedly have the same A18 Pro chip as the iPhone 16 Pro models. Benchmark tests show that the A18 Pro performs slightly better than the M1, which is good enough for most casual users who will be the target audience for this new laptop.
More recently, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the laptop will have a display that’s slightly under 13 inches and will be made of aluminum, despite its lower price. Some analysts believe it will cost as low as $599, but a price between $699 and $799 is more likely. Apple’s Studio Display is nearly four years old and in need of an update. Foundry Studio Display 2 may have an extra surprise
In addition to the highly anticipated MacBook, macOS 26.3 includes drivers for two other unreleased devices: J427 and J527, both variants of a new generation of Studio Display.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple previously accused Qualcomm of “double-dipping” as a result of the company’s policies over selling radio chips for use in iPhones. The Cupertino company had also objected to Qualcomm charging a percentage of the price of an iPhone rather than a fixed fee per chip.

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld TL;DR: This MacBook Air is only $199.97 right now, and shipping is free.
The RAM shortage is already starting to affect computer prices, but it hasn’t touched refurbished devices yet. If you need a low-cost computer for the basics, this MacBook Air is still a good option for only $199.97 (MSRP $999).
Inside, this MacBook has a 1.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB solid-state drive. That combination is enough for web browsing, note-taking, light photo work, and office productivity. The 13.3-inch display has a 1440×900 resolution, which is sharp enough for documents and video without hammering the battery. You also get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you can connect to wireless networks, headphones, and other accessories without hassle. Fully charged, the battery can last up to 12 hours, which gives you plenty of room during busy days when you can’t sit down at an outlet.
This unit has a Grade “A/B” refurbished rating, which means it’s fully tested but may have light scuffs or small marks on the case. That’s also why the price is so low. It can update to macOS Monterey, which keeps it compatible with most modern software, though it will not move to newer macOS 26 releases. You also get a MagSafe charger in the box and a limited third-party warranty.
Shipping is free.
Right now, you can get a MacBook Air on sale for $199.97.
Sale ends February 22 at 11:59 p.m. PT. Apple MacBook Air (2017) 13″ i5 1.8GHz 8GB RAM 128GB SSD Silver (Refurbished)See Deal

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld TL;DR: CleanMy Phone scans duplicates, compresses media, and organizes your camera roll so your iPhone feels new again — for just $19.99.
You know the warning: “iPhone Storage Full.” Suddenly, you’re speed-deleting photos from 2017, removing apps you still probably need, and debating whether one blurry brunch pic is worth iCloud rent.
Instead, there’s an affordable and easy solution.
CleanMy Phone (now $19.99, normally $44.99) acts like a spring cleaning crew for your camera roll. The app scans your device and intelligently finds duplicate photos, giant videos, forgotten screenshots, and low-quality shots you didn’t realize were multiplying.
The surprisingly helpful part? It doesn’t just delete — it suggests. AI highlights the best image in a group, compresses videos without wrecking quality, and can even convert Live Photos to standard shots to save serious space.
Everything runs locally on your device, so your photos never leave your phone. No uploading, no weird privacy tradeoffs — just a cleaner library.
It also shows real-time storage analytics, so you finally understand why 40GB vanished overnight (spoiler: videos and memes).
Instead of upgrading storage again, you might just clean it up.
Because most phones don’t need replacing — they need organizing.
Get CleanMy Phone for your iPhone or iPad while it’s just $19.99 (MSRP $44.99). CleanMyPhone Cleanup Storage AppSee Deal

      <description><![CDATA[Macworld TL;DR: Until February 22 at 11:59 p.m. PT, these MacBook Pros are only $430.
Now is a tough time to need a better computer. Tech prices are going up, but that doesn’t mean you can’t upgrade. This 2020 MacBook Pro is in near-mint condition, but it’s still only $429.97 (reg. $1,999) right now.
This 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 quad-core processor that runs at 2.0GHz, so everyday work like browsing, video calls, and document editing feels smooth. It has 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which is plenty of space for apps, photos, and big project files, and it helps the system stay responsive when you have a lot open at once.
The 13.3-inch Retina display runs at 2560×1600 resolution with True Tone, so text looks sharp, and colors are vivid while the screen adjusts to the lighting in your room. Intel Iris Plus graphics handle streaming, light creative work, and general use without drama. The backlit Magic Keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, and the Touch Bar and Touch ID give you quick shortcuts and fingerprint login.
You get four Thunderbolt 3 ports that handle charging, external displays, and fast storage through USB-C. Wireless connections use 802.11ac Wi Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 for modern routers and accessories.
This Grade A refurbished unit should arrive in near-mint condition, with only minor signs of use. It weighs about 3.1 pounds, comes with a charger, and includes a limited third-party warranty.

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3067073/get-a-free-storage-upgrade-with-this-m5-macbook-pro-deal.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Listen, we love MacBooks around here, but we hate paying Apple’s storage upgrade prices. That’s why today’s deal is so good: B&amp;H Photo is selling the M5 MacBook Pro with 1TB of storage space for $1,599, the same price as the 512GB version. Now that’s a deal worth getting!
So, the 14-inch MacBook Pro M5 is an absolute beast of a laptop that we gave a 4.5-star rating to and our Editors’ Choice award. We loved the improved CPU and GPU performance, as well as how speedy the drive is. We concluded that “the M5 MacBook Pro offers a great combination of price and performance.” And with this deal, you’ll get twice the storage without paying a penny more
The model’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR Display delivers crisp visuals and vibrant colors, as well as an amazing 1,000 nits of brightness that will make it easy to use the laptop in any lighting situation. The laptop also features a slew of ports, including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, USB-C, and an SD card reader, as well as MagSafe for power.]]></description>

      <link>https://www.macworld.com/article/3066031/get-5-2nd-gen-airtags-for-the-price-of-4-with-this-rare-costco-deal.html</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Macworld Apple has a new AirTag for sale, but you’re probably not rushing out to buy one since you can still get the old ones for cheaper. But this deal may change your mind: Costco is throwing in a free AirTag when you buy a 4-pack for $100, essentially giving you five new AirTags for the price of 4, a savings of $45 on the price of buying five AirTags individually. (Note: You don’t need to be a member to take advantage of this deal.)
Apple’s 2nd-gen of AirTags have the same size as the previous model, and they look virtually the same. However, they have a louder speaker, which will make them easier to find even if your keys somehow ended up between couch cushions. Apple also upgraded the Bluetooth chip inside the tracker, expanding the range at which items can be located.
Also new is the U2 Ultra Wideband chip, which will make it possible to more precisely locate lost items, something that will definitely be handy. We’ve already tested the new AirTag 2 and gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, finding it to be a simple and efficient Bluetooth tracker that’s also super easy to set up and fairly inexpensive.]]></description>

They have power stations that hold enough energy to run entire houses for days or weeks at a time. But recently they have been bringing that same battery know-how to a smaller and more consumer-friendly form factor. They have expanded their lineup with the new Rapid Mag power bank product line. The star of the show is their new MagSafe power bank that combines Qi2.2 wireless charging, a built-in USB-C cable, and an integrated kickstand into a slim 10,000mAh design.

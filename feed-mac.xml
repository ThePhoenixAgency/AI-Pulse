The collaboration, branded as "Limited Edition Ritter Sport x ‌Apple Music‌," involves promoting iconic albums on Ritter Sport's iconic 100g square chocolate bars (via Macerkopf). There will be a QR code on the back of each bar that links directly to the album on ‌Apple Music‌ and provides a free trial subscription to the service. Ritter Sport and ‌Apple Music‌ have selected five albums that have shaped German music history across different genres, including Cro's "RAOP," Marteria's "Happy for the Future II," Scorpions' "Crazy World," Sarah Connor's "Mother Tongue," and Helene Fischer's "Farbenspiel," for the series. They are each available on ‌Apple Music‌ in Dolby Atmos. Tags: Apple Music, Germany, Macerkopf

      <description><![CDATA[Blender's work on a native iPad version of its open source 3D creation suite has been shelved, according to the development team. Back in July, Blender revealed that it was developing for iPad, with an iPad Pro version of its desktop software coming first, complete with a fully-featured multitouch interface and support for Apple Pencil Pro. No release date was announced at the time. Blender's GitHub page for iPad development saying that the project is on hold until further notice. YouTuber Brad Colbow, in a response to a offering help on the project, Blender developer Dalai Felinto said that the team was now focusing on Android tablets first instead. During the fall at SIGGRAPH in Vancouver, Blender showed a live tech demo of the software running on iPad, so there's still hope that the project isn't completely dead and will resume at some point. We'll update this story if we learn anything more about a development timeline. Blender website.

The latest example of the pressures Apple and others are under concerns buying DRAM supplies from Samsung.

      <description><![CDATA[The UK government's continued attempts to gain access to iCloud users' private data have prompted U.S. lawmakers to request a briefing about the issue. Apple's iPhone is encrypted to ensure no one can get in, good guys or bad
Apple is a company widely known and often praised for its privacy-first approach, but sometimes that very same philosophy is at odds with the goals of world governments. The iPhone maker famously fought against an FBI request for an encryption backdoor, and it did the same when the UK came up with similar demands of its own.
The drama surrounding the UK's seemingly never-ending pursuit of iCloud user data continues. On Wednesday, two U.S. lawmakers, U.S. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan and Foreign Affairs Chair Brian Mast, requested that the UK government hold a briefing about its planned iCloud encryption backdoor.

Samsung Unpacked took place on February 25, and saw the South Korean electronics giant introduce its latest smartphone lineup. As usual, this included a lot under the Galaxy S26 brand, covering a wide range of performance levels and price points.
The highlight model is the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra, its highest-specification model and largest device on the roster. One that everyone will be comparing with Apple's similarly-framed model, the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Nobody claimed it was going to be equivalent to a MacBook Pro or even a MacBook Air. A code leak details the budget MacBook having an A18 Pro chip, limits on charging, no True Tone, and more. Multicolored MacBooks are on the way
Apple is preparing a new low-cost MacBook model for launch, switching out Apple Silicon's M-series chips for an A-series from the iPhone. While the rumor mill has settled on some core specifications, other measures will help bring the cost of production down for the company.
In a technical analysis of an internal test build of macOS shared with AppleInsider, there will be quite a few smaller changes in the smaller MacBook compared to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The latest iOS 26.4 developer beta has introduced age verification, although so far only for the UK. You can postpone setting it up, but the whole process is absurdly fast to do. Apple has added age verification to the UK iOS 26.4 beta
Amongst features such as improved RCS messaging encryption, the latest iOS 26.4 beta has added age verification for the first time. For now, it's present in the UK beta because the country's Online Safety Act requires it.
Apple's implementation is not part of how the UK uses the act to mandate that adult sites verify users' ages. It's instead another aspect of how parents can already limit their children to age-appropriate apps on the iPhone. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Despite Blizzard's history with Apple's platforms, Overwatch has frustratingly steered clear of the Mac. However, Blizzard is now planning a return via an iPhone game, that takes things in a different direction.
Overwatch Rush is an in-development title that Blizzard describes as an entirely new game made for mobile. Instead of being a first-person shooter, it's a "top-down hero shooter." Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[SSD storage is now a seller's market. Apple's huge buying power no longer means it can dictate better and long-term deals with its iPhone suppliers than anyone else — for now. The iPhone 18 Pro will cost Apple more to manufacture as NAND storage costs rise
Just as it used to buy out as much of TSMC's processor capacity as possible, Apple used to bulk-buy NAND storage. In 2009, for instance, it paid Toshiba $500 million for a long-term deal.
In 2012, Apple bought 23% of the world's NAND supply, paying around $0.67/GB. NAND prices fluctuate greatly, but Apple has almost always paid less than market rates — such as in 2018, when it was reportedly paying an incredibly discounted $0.25 per gigabyte.

The long-rumored iPhone Fold's key feature is its ability to fold its larger display in half. But, as other foldables have shown, there is a risk of there being a noticeable crease in the middle.
If a new leak is correct, Apple's work to minimize the crease has resulted in an exceptional display. If this rumor is correct, it will have a crease, but one only barely observable to its users. Rumor Score: Possible Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

This anticipated new MacBook is expected to be significant because it will use an iPhone processor instead of the Mac's now usual M-series ones. It is that lower-cost processor that means Apple may be able to compete with Chromebooks.
That's key now, and it was important when Apple would release a MacBook range in 2015. But back in 2006 with the follow up to the iBook, the MacBook, the budget-priced and low specification Chromebook was five years away. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Government fines are usually quite sizable when dealing with a company at the scale of Apple. However, in one long-running legal disagreement with Brazil, the fine is unusually small.
State consumer protection watchdog Procon-AL has levied the fine against Apple over its continued lack of a power charger in the iPhone box that ships to consumers. Stemming from an environmental decision made in late 2020 that Apple still follows,the fine insists that it is an essential accessory that should be provided.

While the iPhone 18 Pro isn't expected to feature any major design changes, Apple's next high-end iPhone is set to receive new under-display technology that will reduce the Dynamic Island.

      <description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly told officials that he slept “with one eye open” after he attended a classified CIA briefing on Taiwan, home to the company’s chipmaker TSMC.
US intelligence agencies have been worried for years that China may plan to invade the island, and the briefing warned that this could happen as early as next year …

      <description><![CDATA[The Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode aims to use Apple Intelligence to prioritize notifications to cut them down, yet not have you miss anything important. Here's how to use it. The Reduce Notifications Focus Mode
A strength of Apple Intelligence is that rather than some separate ChatGPT-like app, its features are woven into all aspects of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. But that also makes it confusing when Apple promotes some feature but doesn't say where it fits.
"For example," said Craig Federighi at the WWDC 2024 launch, "your iPhone can prioritize your notifications to minimize unnecessary distractions while ensuring you don't miss something important." Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Messages is an essential app for iPhone users, with it used to communicate with your closest relations. However, people may be getting a bit bored of seeing the usual grey and blue (and sometimes green) speech bubbles floating up a plain white page.
During WWDC, Apple finally made a change to Messages, allowing users to select the background for conversations. A work chat could be jazzed up with corporate-approved branding, while speaking to parents can be done to a background of favorite pets, for example.

      <description><![CDATA[I have been a Philips Hue user for a number of years. They are rock solid, but they aren’t cheap. Recently, one of the bulbs in my hallway finally gave up the ghost. Instead of dropping $45 on a replacement, I decided to look at what the “Matter era” has brought to the table in terms of Wi-Fi only bulbs. I found a Matter-native option that costs less than $10 per bulb. It connects directly over Wi-Fi, requires no hub outside of a HomePod/Apple TV, and works with Apple Home right out of the box.

      <description><![CDATA[A global shortage is responsible for every electronics and computer manufacturer in the world — including Apple — paying twice as much for RAM and flash storage as it did in 2025, and 10 times more than it paid in 2020. Here's why there is little hope of that improving anytime soon. Memory is in short supply globally — Image credit: SK Hynix
Apple has historically been able to closely control the cost of its components. Buying in huge numbers, from multiple suppliers has historically given an economy of scale that made Apple a sought-after customer for everything from display makers to storage vendors.
But that dynamic has changed. A global shortage of key components like memory and storage has seen the price of both skyrocket. Apple is far from the only company impacted. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

It's been two years since Apple Vision Pro arrived on the market, and there still isn't a "killer app." That said, the product has a lot of small features that make it worthwhile, and one of them is sports MultiView.
Apple released visionOS 26.3.1 on Thursday evening with a fix specifically for sports MultiView. The release notes say that a flicker issue could occur while using MultiView in the Apple TV app. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

That might include a low-cost MacBook, but then further ahead there's a hint of a touch-screen MacBook Pro later this year, all on the AppleInsider Podcast. If a MacBook is announced in March, it won't be a MacBook Pro — but a touch-screen one is expected later in 2026
What we actually know about next week is that there will be launches. Tim Cook doesn't hint if there's nothing much to say, but he also tagged his post #AppleLaunch.
So we know something is coming, and if you listen to the leaks, actually everything is coming. If you've ever heard it rumored, it's all due out next week for sure. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

Steve Jobs was not Apple's first Chief Executive Officer. While he founded the company on April 1, 1976, with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, Jobs had no experience running what was aiming to become a large company.
So a CEO was needed, but actually Apple's first two chief executives are tightly interlinked. Mike Markkula would become the second one, but he hired the first — and then later persuaded that first to leave. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Apple TV is doing great in Brazil, but services chief Eddy Cue says Apple doesn't have any plans for new content developed in the country. Apple's SVP of services, Eddy Cue, says Brazil is Apple TV's fastest-growing market.
During a special press event on February 4, Apple previewed content coming to its streaming service in 2026, with several new films and series set to debut on Apple TV later in the year. However, we didn't hear much about Apple's international streaming-related endeavors — until now.
Apple's Senior Vice President of Services, Eddy Cue, revealed a few key details about the future of Apple TV in an interview with the Brazilian publication Folha de Sao Paulo, spotted by 9to5mac. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums]]></description>

So I wanted to put a list together of some of those amazing magic ecosystem moments that iPadOS and MacOS give you together.

      <description><![CDATA[Apple's App Store age verification system has been updated to ensure compliance can be maintained in places like Louisiana, Utah, Australia, Brazil, and Singapore. Apple has updated its assortment of age assurance tools related to the App Store.
In response to increasingly strict age-assurance laws, like Utah's App Store Accountability Act, Apple has updated its requirements for apps distributed in specific countries. iOS applications made available to users in Australia, Brazil, Singapore, Louisiana, and Utah will have to abide by the modified App Store age requirements.
Specifically, users in Australia, Brazil, and Singapore will be blocked from downloading applications rated 18+, unless the users are confirmed to be adults through "reasonable methods." The App Store can automatically confirm whether or not a user is an adult, and the change is already in effect as of Tuesday, February 24.

      <description><![CDATA[Discord is delaying the global rollout of its age verification system until the second half of 2026 following user backlash over privacy concerns, biometric checks, and third-party vendors. Discord icon
Chief Technology Officer Stanislav Vishnevskiy said the company "missed the mark" in explaining how the system works and promised greater transparency before a global launch. The announcement follows criticism fueled in part by distrust after a 2025 data breach involving a former customer service provider.

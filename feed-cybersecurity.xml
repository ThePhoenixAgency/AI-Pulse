      <description><![CDATA[In my last blog post I introduced the new Windows feature, Administrator Protection and how it aimed to create a secure boundary for UAC where one didn’t exist.

In this blog post I wanted to describe the root cause of 5 of those 9 issues, specifically the implementation of UI Access, how this has been a long standing problem with UAC that’s been under-appreciated, and how it’s being fixed now.]]></description>

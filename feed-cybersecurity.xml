Instead of flashy new exploits, many operations are built around quiet misuse of trusted tools, familiar workflows, and overlooked exposures that sit in plain sight.
Another shift is how access is gained versus how it’s used. Initial entry points are getting simpler, while post-compromise]]></description>

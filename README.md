So, there’s a new AirTagthat’s louder and a bit more accurate from longer distances. But otherwise it’s the same, so why pay full price when you can get a four-pack of AirTags 1 for $64? That’ $35 off the original price (the same price you’ll pay for AirTag 2) and the best price we’ve ever seen.
Apple’s AirTags integrate directly with the Find My app on your iPhone and other Apple devices, allowing users to locate wallets, luggage, or backpacks with ease. Just open the app and use it to locate the tag by making it beep.

A new iPhone 18 Pro Max leak claims that will see the smallest year-over-year battery capacity increase in years, although the final use figures depends more on the power efficiency of the A20 processor.


The iPhone 18 Pro Max should see an improvement in battery life
Recent rumors have claimed that the expected iPhone Fold will have the largest-capacity battery the iPhone has ever had. But dubious leaks specifying a capacity figure claim it will be a 5,000mAh battery, and now the iPhone 18 Pro Max will reportedly beat it.

"I spend a lot of time thinking about who's in the room five years from now, 10 years from now," said Cook, who was taking questions, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. "I am obsessed with this — who's in the room 15 years from now."

Financial Times reported that Apple was preparing for Cook to step down as soon as early 2026.

Apple launched a new series of iPhones at the end of 2025: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, as well as a brand new iPhone Air, but there was no new iPhone 17e for those hoping for an update to the budget iPhone.
This wasn’t a surprise: Apple released the iPhone 16e in February 2025 to replace the iPhone SE, so an update to the iPhone “e” series phones wasn’t expected to arrive until early 2026.
If you’re considering buying an iPhone 17e, this is the place to keep up to date on its development.

At an all-hands meeting on Thursday, Apple CEO Tim Cook did his best to reassure employees about the company’s prospects in the AI market, a market in which it has so far struggled to achieve relevance. When questioned about rivals’ launches of new types of AI device, Cook insisted that Apple isn’t concerned.
“There will be new categories of products and services that are enabled through AI, and we’re extremely excited about that,” he said, as reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
The iPhone 18 Pro Max will feature a bigger battery for continued best-in-class battery life, according to a known Weibo leaker.


Citing supply chain information, the Weibo user known as "Digital Chat Station" said that the ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max will have a battery capacity of 5,100 to 5,200 mAh. Combined with the efficiency improvements of the A20 Pro chip, made with TSMC's 2nm process, the device could tout extremely impressive battery life. It is expected to be thicker than its predecessor to facilitate the larger battery.

Apple Health to get multiple smaller feature updates soon
Apple has never announced Health+ or plans for the initiative, but leaks surrounding the project suggested some kind of AI chat interface was going to be offered. Users would be able to discuss their health data and be directed to professional videos explaining certain topics.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
Users shouldn't be afraid of exploring music or letting their kids choose a song, but since Apple Music lacks manual algorithm controls, one wrong song can upend your recommendations for weeks.


Apple Music is great except when you accidentally poison your algorithm
Apple Music is debatably the best option for music streaming, especially for those committed to the Apple ecosystem. However, as great as the app and human curation aspects can be, there is a fatal flaw that requires users to either actively fight it or give up entirely.

Folding phones are everywhere. There are enough of them that our friends at TechAdvisor have maintained a best folding phone guide for several years. Samsung even just came out with a tri-fold phone, in a very “we made a razor with even more blades” sort of approach.
And while folding phones have gotten quite good over the past several years and are reasonably popular considering the high price they command ($1,500 or more for the best models), the expectations for Apple’s long-awaited folding iPhone are a lot higher.

After a few years of rumors about the feature, Apple added live translated captions to FaceTime in iOS 26, allowing one-on-one calls to display real-time subtitles spanning languages. Here's where to find live translation in FaceTime, and how it came to be.

FaceTime
Live translation in FaceTime is a big new feature, but many users don't even know it's there. That's because Apple doesn't make it clear or easy to find as a translation option.
Plus, the translation feature isn't found under Apple Intelligence settings or FaceTime menus where you might expect it.

The monitor might be the second-most important part of your Mac’s setup after the Mac, of course–after all, you can’t use any desktop computer without one and even the 16-inch screen on the MacBook Pro is going to feel cramped if you are having a particularly productive morning. Spread your work out by plugging in multiple monitors to your Mac and extending your desktop over a wider space.
Because you’ll spend a lot of time looking at the display, you’ll want to invest wisely.

TL;DR: This is Microsoft Office for Mac the old-school way: one $50 payment (MSRP $219), lifetime access, no monthly fees.
There are two kinds of Mac users: those who live inside Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—and those who quietly resent paying a monthly fee just to keep using them. If you’re in the second group, this deal is for you.
Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2021 for Mac delivers the classic Office experience with a one-time purchase instead of an ongoing subscription.

TL;DR: Pick up an iPad 11 on sale for only $370 (reg. $499).
The global RAM shortage is causing tech prices to rise across the board, but refurbished prices are still staying low. This 2025 iPad 11 is in near-mint condition, but because it’s technically a refurb, it only costs $369.99 instead of $499.
This iPad 11 has an A16 chip with a 5-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, so it can handle multitasking, 4K video editing, and everyday apps without feeling slow.

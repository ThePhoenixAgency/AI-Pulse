Apple just can’t seem to get its new Siri off the ground. A new report from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg says that testing of the big Siri overhaul due in iOS 26.4 (soon to enter beta, with a release planned for March) will instead be spread out over the rest of the year. At this point, it’s hard to have confidence that important planned features won’t be delayed further.
Gurman’s sources tell him that testing has “run into snags in recent weeks” and that some of the features will be delayed to iOS 26.5 (due in May) or iOS 27 (due in September).

### 1. `EN` [Railway secures $100 million to challenge AWS with AI-native cloud infrastructure](data/articles/e670024b9a32e878ab282337aaddf6f9.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Railway, a San Francisco-based cloud platform that has quietly amassed two million developers without spending a dollar on marketing, announced Thursday that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, as surging demand for artificial intelligence applications exposes the limitations of legacy cloud infrastructure.
TQ Ventures led the round, with participation from FPV Ventures, Redpoint, and Unusual Ventures. The investment values Railway as one of the most significant infrastructure startups to emerge during the AI boom, capitalizing on developer frustration with the complexity and cost of traditional platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.
"As AI models get better at writing code, more and more people are asking the age-old question: where, and how, do I run my applications?" said Jake Cooper, Railway's 28-year-old founder and chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. "The last generation of cloud primitives were slow and outdated, and now with AI moving everything faster, teams simply can't keep up."
The funding is a dramatic acceleration for a company that has charted an unconventional path through the cloud computing industry. Railway raised just $24 million in total before this round, including a $20 million Series A from Redpoint in 2022. The company now processes more than 10 million deployments monthly and handles over one trillion requests through its edge network — metrics that rival far larger and better-funded competitors.
Why three-minute deploy times have become unacceptable in the age of AI coding assistants
Railway's pitch rests on a simple observation: the tools developers use to deploy and manage software were designed for a slower era. A standard build-and-deploy cycle using Terraform, the industry-standard infrastructure tool, takes two to three minutes. That delay, once tolerable, has become a critical bottleneck as AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor can generate working code in seconds.
"When godly intelligence is on tap and can solve any problem in three seconds, those amalgamations of systems become bottlenecks," Cooper told VentureBeat. "What was really cool for humans to deploy in 10 seconds or less is now table stakes for agents."
The company claims its platform delivers deployments in under one second — fast enough to keep pace with AI-generated code. Customers report a tenfold increase in developer velocity and up to 65 percent cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.
These numbers come directly from enterprise clients, not internal benchmarks. Daniel Lobaton, chief technology officer at G2X, a platform serving 100,000 federal contractors, measured deployment speed improvements of seven times faster and an 87 percent cost reduction after migrating to Railway. His infrastructure bill dropped from $15,000 per month to approximately $1,000.
"The work that used to take me a week on our previous infrastructure, I can do in Railway in like a day," Lobaton said. "If I want to spin up a new service and test different architectures, it would take so long on our old setup. In Railway I can launch six services in two minutes."
Inside the controversial decision to abandon Google Cloud and build data centers from scratch
What distinguishes Railway from competitors like Render and Fly.io is the depth of its vertical integration. In 2024, the company made the unusual decision to abandon Google Cloud entirely and build its own data centers, a move that echoes the famous Alan Kay maxim: "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware."
"We wanted to design hardware in a way where we could build a differentiated experience," Cooper said. "Having full control over the network, compute, and storage layers lets us do really fast build and deploy loops, the kind that allows us to move at 'agentic speed' while staying 100 percent the smoothest ride in town."
The approach paid dividends during recent widespread outages that affected major cloud providers — Railway remained online throughout.
This soup-to-nuts control enables pricing that undercuts the hyperscalers by roughly 50 percent and newer cloud startups by three to four times. Railway charges by the second for actual compute usage: $0.00000386 per gigabyte-second of memory, $0.00000772 per vCPU-second, and $0.00000006 per gigabyte-second of storage. There are no charges for idle virtual machines — a stark contrast to the traditional cloud model where customers pay for provisioned capacity whether they use it or not.
"The conventional wisdom is that the big guys have economies of scale to offer better pricing," Cooper noted. "But when they're charging for VMs that usually sit idle in the cloud, and we've purpose-built everything to fit much more density on these machines, you have a big opportunity."
How 30 employees built a platform generating tens of millions in annual revenue
Railway has achieved its scale with a team of just 30 employees generating tens of millions in annual revenue — a ratio of revenue per employee that would be exceptional even for established software companies. The company grew revenue 3.5 times last year and continues to expand at 15 percent month-over-month.
Cooper emphasized that the fundraise was strategic rather than necessary. "We're default alive; there's no reason for us to raise money," he said. "We raised because we see a massive opportunity to accelerate, not because we needed to survive."
The company hired its first salesperson only last year and employs just two solutions engineers. Nearly all of Railway's two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.
"We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come," Cooper recalled. "And to some degree, they came."
From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway's unlikely corporate expansion
Despite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.
Notable customers include Bilt, the loyalty program company; Intuit's GoCo subsidiary; TripAdvisor's Cruise Critic; and MGM Resorts. Kernel, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.
"At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS," said Rafael Garcia, Kernel's chief technology officer. "Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012."
For enterprise customers, Railway offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer's existing cloud environment through a "bring your own cloud" configuration.
Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).
The startup's bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivals
Railway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.
Cooper argues that Railway's competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.
"The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven't gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money," he observed. "They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don't really need to?"
Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. "We're not just containers; we've got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing," Cooper said. "And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster."
The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.
Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists today
Railway's fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.
"The amount of software that's going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we're talking a thousand times more software," Cooper predicted. "All of that has to run somewhere."
The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls "loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically." Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.
"The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes," Cooper said. "You don't have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity."
What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experience
Railway plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company's five-year history.
"One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business," Cooper explained. "We've built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what's been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage."
The company's investor roster reads like a who's who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Guillermo Rauch, chief executive of Vercel; Spencer Kimball, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; Olivier Pomel, chief executive of Datadog; and Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear.
The timing of Railway's expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper's telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.
Whether Railway can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at Wolfram Alpha, Bloomberg, and Uber before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.
"In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period," he said. "Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That's the prize worth playing for, and there's no bigger one on offer."
For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.

### 2. `EN` [Claude Code costs up to $200 a month. Goose does the same thing for free.](data/articles/1bd5d5f60cc30b30eee498627c185f8f.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
The artificial intelligence coding revolution comes with a catch: it's expensive.
Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-based AI agent that can write, debug, and deploy code autonomously, has captured the imagination of software developers worldwide. But its pricing — ranging from $20 to $200 per month depending on usage — has sparked a growing rebellion among the very programmers it aims to serve.
Now, a free alternative is gaining traction. Goose, an open-source AI agent developed by Block (the financial technology company formerly known as Square), offers nearly identical functionality to Claude Code but runs entirely on a user's local machine. No subscription fees. No cloud dependency. No rate limits that reset every five hours.
"Your data stays with you, period," said Parth Sareen, a software engineer who demonstrated the tool during a recent livestream. The captures the core appeal: Goose gives developers complete control over their AI-powered workflow, including the ability to work offline — even on an airplane.
The project has exploded in popularity. Goose now boasts more than 26,100 stars on GitHub, the code-sharing platform, with 362 contributors and 102 releases since its launch. The latest version, 1.20.1, shipped on January 19, 2026, reflecting a development pace that rivals commercial products.
For developers frustrated by Claude Code's pricing structure and usage caps, Goose represents something increasingly rare in the AI industry: a genuinely free, no-strings-attached option for serious work. Anthropic's new rate limits spark a developer revolt
To understand why Goose matters, you need to understand the Claude Code pricing controversy.
Anthropic, the San Francisco artificial intelligence company founded by former OpenAI executives, offers Claude Code as part of its subscription tiers. The free plan provides no access whatsoever. The Pro plan, at $17 per month with annual billing (or $20 monthly), limits users to just 10 to 40 prompts every five hours — a constraint that serious developers exhaust within minutes of intensive work.
The Max plans, at $100 and $200 per month, offer more headroom: 50 to 200 prompts and 200 to 800 prompts respectively, plus access to Anthropic's most powerful model, Claude 4.5 Opus. But even these premium tiers come with restrictions that have inflamed the developer community.
In late July, Anthropic announced new weekly rate limits. Under the system, Pro users receive 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 usage per week. Max users at the $200 tier get 240 to 480 hours of Sonnet 4, plus 24 to 40 hours of Opus 4. Nearly five months later, the frustration has not subsided.
The problem? Those "hours" are not actual hours. They represent token-based limits that vary wildly depending on codebase size, conversation length, and the complexity of the code being processed. Independent analysis suggests the actual per-session limits translate to roughly 44,000 tokens for Pro users and 220,000 tokens for the $200 Max plan.
"It's confusing and vague," one developer wrote in a widely shared analysis. "When they say '24-40 hours of Opus 4,' that doesn't really tell you anything useful about what you're actually getting."
The backlash on Reddit and developer forums has been fierce. Some users report hitting their daily limits within 30 minutes of intensive coding. Others have canceled their subscriptions entirely, calling the new restrictions "a joke" and "unusable for real work."
Anthropic has defended the changes, stating that the limits affect fewer than five percent of users and target people running Claude Code "continuously in the background, 24/7." But the company has not clarified whether that figure refers to five percent of Max subscribers or five percent of all users — a distinction that matters enormously.
How Block built a free AI coding agent that works offline
Goose takes a radically different approach to the same problem.
Built by Block, the payments company led by Jack Dorsey, Goose is what engineers call an "on-machine AI agent." Unlike Claude Code, which sends your queries to Anthropic's servers for processing, Goose can run entirely on your local computer using open-source language models that you download and control yourself.
The project's documentation describes it as going "beyond code suggestions" to "install, execute, edit, and test with any LLM." That last phrase — "any LLM" — is the key differentiator. Goose is model-agnostic by design.
You can connect Goose to Anthropic's Claude models if you have API access. You can use OpenAI's GPT-5 or Google's Gemini. You can route it through services like Groq or OpenRouter. Or — and this is where things get interesting — you can run it entirely locally using tools like Ollama, which let you download and execute open-source models on your own hardware.
The practical implications are significant. With a local setup, there are no subscription fees, no usage caps, no rate limits, and no concerns about your code being sent to external servers. Your conversations with the AI never leave your machine.
"I use Ollama all the time on planes — it's a lot of fun!" Sareen noted during a demonstration, highlighting how local models free developers from the constraints of internet connectivity.
What Goose can do that traditional code assistants can't
Goose operates as a command-line tool or desktop application that can autonomously perform complex development tasks. It can build entire projects from scratch, write and execute code, debug failures, orchestrate workflows across multiple files, and interact with external APIs — all without constant human oversight.
The architecture relies on what the AI industry calls "tool calling" or "function calling" — the ability for a language model to request specific actions from external systems. When you ask Goose to create a new file, run a test suite, or check the status of a GitHub pull request, it doesn't just generate text describing what should happen. It actually executes those operations.
This capability depends heavily on the underlying language model. Claude 4 models from Anthropic currently perform best at tool calling, according to the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, which ranks models on their ability to translate natural language requests into executable code and system commands.
But newer open-source models are catching up quickly. Goose's documentation highlights several options with strong tool-calling support: Meta's Llama series, Alibaba's Qwen models, Google's Gemma variants, and DeepSeek's reasoning-focused architectures.
The tool also integrates with the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, an emerging standard for connecting AI agents to external services. Through MCP, Goose can access databases, search engines, file systems, and third-party APIs — extending its capabilities far beyond what the base language model provides.
Setting Up Goose with a Local Model
For developers interested in a completely free, privacy-preserving setup, the process involves three main components: Goose itself, Ollama (a tool for running open-source models locally), and a compatible language model.
Step 1: Install Ollama
Ollama is an open-source project that dramatically simplifies the process of running large language models on personal hardware. It handles the complex work of downloading, optimizing, and serving models through a simple interface.
Download and install Ollama from ollama.com. Once installed, you can pull models with a single command. For coding tasks, Qwen 2.5 offers strong tool-calling support:
ollama run qwen2.5
The model downloads automatically and begins running on your machine.
Step 2: Install Goose
Goose is available as both a desktop application and a command-line interface. The desktop version provides a more visual experience, while the CLI appeals to developers who prefer working entirely in the terminal.
Installation instructions vary by operating system but generally involve downloading from Goose's GitHub releases page or using a package manager. Block provides pre-built binaries for macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux.
Step 3: Configure the Connection
In Goose Desktop, navigate to Settings, then Configure Provider, and select Ollama. Confirm that the API Host is set to http://localhost:11434 (Ollama's default port) and click Submit.
For the command-line version, run goose configure, select "Configure Providers," choose Ollama, and enter the model name when prompted.
That's it. Goose is now connected to a language model running entirely on your hardware, ready to execute complex coding tasks without any subscription fees or external dependencies.
The RAM, processing power, and trade-offs you should know about
The obvious question: what kind of computer do you need?
Running large language models locally requires substantially more computational resources than typical software. The key constraint is memory — specifically, RAM on most systems, or VRAM if using a dedicated graphics card for acceleration.
Block's documentation suggests that 32 gigabytes of RAM provides "a solid baseline for larger models and outputs." For Mac users, this means the computer's unified memory is the primary bottleneck. For Windows and Linux users with discrete NVIDIA graphics cards, GPU memory (VRAM) matters more for acceleration.
But you don't necessarily need expensive hardware to get started. Smaller models with fewer parameters run on much more modest systems. Qwen 2.5, for instance, comes in multiple sizes, and the smaller variants can operate effectively on machines with 16 gigabytes of RAM.
"You don't need to run the largest models to get excellent results," Sareen emphasized. The practical recommendation: start with a smaller model to test your workflow, then scale up as needed.
For context, Apple's entry-level MacBook Air with 8 gigabytes of RAM would struggle with most capable coding models. But a MacBook Pro with 32 gigabytes — increasingly common among professional developers — handles them comfortably.
Why keeping your code off the cloud matters more than ever
Goose with a local LLM is not a perfect substitute for Claude Code. The comparison involves real trade-offs that developers should understand.
Model Quality: Claude 4.5 Opus, Anthropic's flagship model, remains arguably the most capable AI for software engineering tasks. It excels at understanding complex codebases, following nuanced instructions, and producing high-quality code on the first attempt. Open-source models have improved dramatically, but a gap persists — particularly for the most challenging tasks.
One developer who switched to the $200 Claude Code plan described the difference bluntly: "When I say 'make this look modern,' Opus knows what I mean. Other models give me Bootstrap circa 2015."
Context Window: Claude Sonnet 4.5, accessible through the API, offers a massive one-million-token context window — enough to load entire large codebases without chunking or context management issues. Most local models are limited to 4,096 or 8,192 tokens by default, though many can be configured for longer contexts at the cost of increased memory usage and slower processing.
Speed: Cloud-based services like Claude Code run on dedicated server hardware optimized for AI inference. Local models, running on consumer laptops, typically process requests more slowly. The difference matters for iterative workflows where you're making rapid changes and waiting for AI feedback.
Tooling Maturity: Claude Code benefits from Anthropic's dedicated engineering resources. Features like prompt caching (which can reduce costs by up to 90 percent for repeated contexts) and structured outputs are polished and well-documented. Goose, while actively developed with 102 releases to date, relies on community contributions and may lack equivalent refinement in specific areas.
How Goose stacks up against Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and the paid AI coding market
Goose enters a crowded market of AI coding tools, but occupies a distinctive position.
Cursor, a popular AI-enhanced code editor, charges $20 per month for its Pro tier and $200 for Ultra—pricing that mirrors Claude Code's Max plans. Cursor provides approximately 4,500 Sonnet 4 requests per month at the Ultra level, a substantially different allocation model than Claude Code's hourly resets.
Cline, Roo Code, and similar open-source projects offer AI coding assistance but with varying levels of autonomy and tool integration. Many focus on code completion rather than the agentic task execution that defines Goose and Claude Code.
Amazon's CodeWhisperer, GitHub Copilot, and enterprise offerings from major cloud providers target large organizations with complex procurement processes and dedicated budgets. They are less relevant to individual developers and small teams seeking lightweight, flexible tools.
Goose's combination of genuine autonomy, model agnosticism, local operation, and zero cost creates a unique value proposition. The tool is not trying to compete with commercial offerings on polish or model quality. It's competing on freedom — both financial and architectural.
The $200-a-month era for AI coding tools may be ending

### 3. `EN` [Nous Research's NousCoder-14B is an open-source coding model landing right in the Claude Code moment](data/articles/b37d936464575171be4586234d600b41.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Nous Research, the open-source artificial intelligence startup backed by crypto venture firm Paradigm, released a new competitive programming model on Monday that it says matches or exceeds several larger proprietary systems — trained in just four days using 48 of Nvidia's latest B200 graphics processors.
The model, called NousCoder-14B, is another entry in a crowded field of AI coding assistants, but arrives at a particularly charged moment: Claude Code, the agentic programming tool from rival Anthropic, has dominated social media discussion since New Year's Day, with developers posting breathless testimonials about its capabilities. The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving — and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written.
type: embedded-entry-inline id: 74cSyrq6OUrp9SEQ5zOUSl
NousCoder-14B achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on LiveCodeBench v6, a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba's Qwen3-14B, according to Nous Research's technical report published alongside the release.
"I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour," wrote Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing — a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt.
The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic's Claude Code has captured imaginations with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap — and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability. How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicate
What distinguishes the NousCoder-14B release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the model weights but the complete reinforcement learning environment, benchmark suite, and training harness — built on the company's Atropos framework — enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to reproduce or extend the work.
"Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research," noted one observer on X, summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities.
The model was trained by Joe Li, a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li's technical report reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model's improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance.
Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B's improvemen t— from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 — mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days.
"Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience," Li wrote in the technical report.
But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners. Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problems
NousCoder-14B's training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.
The approach relies on what researchers call "verifiable rewards" — a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale.
Nous Research used Modal, a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints — 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively.
The training employed a technique called DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization), which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves "dynamic sampling" — discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning.
The researchers also adopted "iterative context extension," first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent.
Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification — as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters. The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progress
Buried in Li's technical report is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses "a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format."
In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data.
"The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude," Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. "This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data."
This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is "increasingly finite," as Li put it.
"It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures," he concluded.
The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn't — making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult.
Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. "Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction," he wrote. A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big Tech

**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup, Listen Labs, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million offers seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a billboard in San Francisco displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.
The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.
That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by Ribbit Capital with participation from Evantic and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Conviction, and Pear VC. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews. "When you obsess over customers, everything else follows," Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. "Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is."
Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it
Listen's AI researcher finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.
Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: "Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can't get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys." The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, "gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they're talking about. And the problem is you can't scale that."
The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.
What distinguishes Listen's approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. "In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options," Wahlforss said. "Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty."
The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraud
Listen finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called "one of the most shocking things that we've learned when we entered this industry"—rampant fraud.
"Essentially, there's a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players," he explained. "We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud."
The company built what it calls a "quality guard" that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: "People talk three times more. They're much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health."
Emeritus, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. "We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information," said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.
How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better products
The speed advantage has proven central to Listen's pitch. Traditional customer research at Microsoft could take four to six weeks to generate insights. "By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it," said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.
With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.
The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. "We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward," Patel said, "and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day." Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.
Simple Modern, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. "We went from 'Should we even have this product?' to 'How should we launch it?'" said Chris Hoyle, the company's Chief Marketing Officer.
Chubbies, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. "There's school, sports, dinner, and homework," explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. "I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules."
The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI "through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed." The redesigned product became "a blockbuster hit."
The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not less
Listen Labs is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly $140 billion annually, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption.
"There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing," Wahlforss said. "Why we're replacing them is that one, they're super costly. Two, they're kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with."
But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn't just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption.
"What I've noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don't need less of it. You want more of it," Wahlforss explained. "There's infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren't researchers before can now do that as part of their job."
Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toilet
Listen Labs traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. "We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day," Wahlforss recalled. "We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today."
The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss's co-founder "was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot." The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the International Olympiad in Informatics — the same competition that produced the founders of Cognition, the AI coding startup.
The Berghain billboard stunt generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.
"We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet," he said. "But now we fixed that situation."
The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.
Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building next
Wahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building "the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we've done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices."
Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. "Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?"
Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. "Obviously, as you said, there's kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop."
The company already handles sensitive data with care. "We don't train on any of the data," Wahlforss said. "We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that."
How AI could reshape the future of product development
Perhaps the most provocative implication of Listen's model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop.
"They're based in Australia, so they're coding during the day, and then in their night, they're releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate."
The vision extends Y Combinator's famous dictum — "write code, talk to users" — into an automated cycle. "Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you'll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously."
Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen's control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A 2024 MIT study found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos.
"I'm constantly have to emphasize like, let's make sure the quality is there and the details are right," he said.
But the company's growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft's Patel said Listen has "removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work." Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day.
"It's a total game changer," said Ali Romero, Sling Money's marketing manager.
Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he's building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website.
One of them: "Slow is fake."
It's an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution. But Listen Labs is betting that in the AI era, the companies that listen fastest will be the ones that win. The only question is whether customers will talk back.

### 5. `EN` [Salesforce rolls out new Slackbot AI agent as it battles Microsoft and Google in workplace AI](data/articles/db7ff708ed2fd3ffb22714bc4e846e1c.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Salesforce on Tuesday launched an entirely rebuilt version of Slackbot, the company's workplace assistant, transforming it from a simple notification tool into what executives describe as a fully powered AI agent capable of searching enterprise data, drafting documents, and taking action on behalf of employees.
The new Slackbot, now generally available to Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, is Salesforce's most aggressive move yet to position Slack at the center of the emerging "agentic AI" movement — where software agents work alongside humans to complete complex tasks. The launch comes as Salesforce attempts to convince investors that artificial intelligence will bolster its products rather than render them obsolete.
"Slackbot isn't just another copilot or AI assistant," said Parker Harris, Salesforce co-founder and Slack's chief technology officer, in an exclusive interview with Salesforce. "It's the front door to the agentic enterprise, powered by Salesforce."
From tricycle to Porsche: Salesforce rebuilt Slackbot from the ground up
Harris was blunt about what distinguishes the new Slackbot from its predecessor: "The old Slackbot was, you know, a little tricycle, and the new Slackbot is like, you know, a Porsche."
The original Slackbot, which has existed since Slack's early days, performed basic algorithmic tasks — reminding users to add colleagues to documents, suggesting channel archives, and delivering simple notifications. The new version runs on an entirely different architecture built around a large language model and sophisticated search capabilities that can access Salesforce records, Google Drive files, calendar data, and years of Slack conversations.
"It's two different things," Harris explained. "The old Slackbot was algorithmic and fairly simple. The new Slackbot is brand new — it's based around an LLM and a very robust search engine, and connections to third-party search engines, third-party enterprise data."
Salesforce chose to retain the Slackbot brand despite the fundamental technical overhaul. "People know what Slackbot is, and so we wanted to carry that forward," Harris said.
Why Anthropic's Claude powers the new Slackbot — and which AI models could come next
The new Slackbot runs on Claude, Anthropic's large language model, a choice driven partly by compliance requirements. Slack's commercial service operates under FedRAMP Moderate certification to serve U.S. federal government customers, and Harris said Anthropic was "the only provider that could give us a compliant LLM" when Slack began building the new system.
But that exclusivity won't last. "We are, this year, going to support additional providers," Harris said. "We have a great relationship with Google. Gemini is incredible — performance is great, cost is great. So we're going to use Gemini for some things." He added that OpenAI remains a possibility as well.
Harris echoed Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's view that large language models are becoming commoditized: "You've heard Marc talk about LLMs are commodities, that they're democratized. I call them CPUs."
On the sensitive question of training data, Harris was unequivocal: Salesforce does not train any models on customer data. "Models don't have any sort of security," he explained. "If we trained it on some confidential conversation that you and I have, I don't want Carolyn to know — if I train it into the LLM, there is no way for me to say you get to see the answer, but Carolyn doesn't."
Inside Salesforce's internal experiment: 80,000 employees tested Slackbot with striking results
Salesforce has been testing the new Slackbot internally for months, rolling it out to all 80,000 employees. According to Ryan Gavin, Slack's chief marketing officer, the results have been striking: "It's the fastest adopted product in Salesforce history."
Internal data shows that two-thirds of Salesforce employees have tried the new Slackbot, with 80% of those users continuing to use it regularly. Internal satisfaction rates reached 96% — the highest for any AI feature Slack has shipped. Employees report saving between two and 20 hours per week.
The adoption happened largely organically. "I think it was about five days, and a Canvas was developed by our employees called 'The Most Stealable Slackbot Prompts,'" Gavin said. "People just started adding to it organically. I think it's up to 250-plus prompts that are in this Canvas right now."
Kate Crotty, a principal UX researcher at Salesforce, found that 73% of internal adoption was driven by social sharing rather than top-down mandates. "Everybody is there to help each other learn and communicate hacks," she said.
How Slackbot transforms scattered enterprise data into executive-ready insights
During a product demonstration, Amy Bauer, Slack's product experience designer, showed how Slackbot can synthesize information across multiple sources. In one example, she asked Slackbot to analyze customer feedback from a pilot program, upload an image of a usage dashboard, and have Slackbot correlate the qualitative and quantitative data.
"This is where Slackbot really earns its keep for me," Bauer explained. "What it's doing is not just simply reading the image — it's actually looking at the image and comparing it to the insight it just generated for me."
Slackbot can then query Salesforce to find enterprise accounts with open deals that might be good candidates for early access, creating what Bauer called "a really great justification and plan to move forward." Finally, it can synthesize all that information into a Canvas — Slack's collaborative document format — and find calendar availability among stakeholders to schedule a review meeting.
"Up until this point, we have been working in a one-to-one capacity with Slackbot," Bauer said. "But one of the benefits that I can do now is take this insight and have it generate this into a Canvas, a shared workspace where I can iterate on it, refine it with Slackbot, or share it out with my team."
Rob Seaman, Slack's chief product officer, said the Canvas creation demonstrates where the product is heading: "This is making a tool call internally to Slack Canvas to actually write, effectively, a shared document. But it signals where we're going with Slackbot — we're eventually going to be adding in additional third-party tool calls."
MrBeast's company became a Slackbot guinea pig—and employees say they're saving 90 minutes a day
Among Salesforce's pilot customers is Beast Industries, the parent company of YouTube star MrBeast. Luis Madrigal, the company's chief information officer, joined the launch announcement to describe his experience.
"As somebody who has rolled out enterprise technologies for over two decades now, this was practically one of the easiest," Madrigal said. "The plumbing is there. Slack as an implementation, Enterprise Tools — being able to turn on the Slackbot and the Slack AI functionality was as simple as having my team go in, review, do a quick security review."
Madrigal said his security team signed off "rather quickly" — unusual for enterprise AI deployments — because Slackbot accesses only the information each individual user already has permission to view. "Given all the guardrails you guys have put into place for Slackbot to be unique and customized to only the information that each individual user has, only the conversations and the Slack rooms and Slack channels that they're part of—that made my security team sign off rather quickly."
One Beast Industries employee, Sinan, the head of Beast Games marketing, reported saving "at bare minimum, 90 minutes a day." Another employee, Spencer, a creative supervisor, described it as "an assistant who's paying attention when I'm not."
Other pilot customers include Slalom, reMarkable, Xero, Mercari, and Engine. Mollie Bodensteiner, SVP of Operations at Engine, called Slackbot "an absolute 'chaos tamer' for our team," estimating it saves her about 30 minutes daily "just by eliminating context switching."

### 6. `EN` [Anthropic launches Cowork, a Claude Desktop agent that works in your files — no coding required](data/articles/a102a18a5efc083299a9baaa1b4a8378.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Anthropic released Cowork on Monday, a new AI agent capability that extends the power of its wildly successful Claude Code tool to non-technical users — and according to company insiders, the team built the entire feature in approximately a week and a half, largely using Claude Code itself.
The launch marks a major inflection point in the race to deliver practical AI agents to mainstream users, positioning Anthropic to compete not just with OpenAI and Google in conversational AI, but with Microsoft's Copilot in the burgeoning market for AI-powered productivity tools.
"Cowork lets you complete non-technical tasks much like how developers use Claude Code," the company announced via its official Claude account on X. The feature arrives as a research preview available exclusively to Claude Max subscribers — Anthropic's power-user tier priced between $100 and $200 per month — through the macOS desktop application.
For the past year, the industry narrative has focused on large language models that can write poetry or debug code. With Cowork, Anthropic is betting that the real enterprise value lies in an AI that can open a folder, read a messy pile of receipts, and generate a structured expense report without human hand-holding. How developers using a coding tool for vacation research inspired Anthropic's latest product
The genesis of Cowork lies in Anthropic's recent success with the developer community. In late 2024, the company released Claude Code, a terminal-based tool that allowed software engineers to automate rote programming tasks. The tool was a hit, but Anthropic noticed a peculiar trend: users were forcing the coding tool to perform non-coding labor.
According to Boris Cherny, an engineer at Anthropic, the company observed users deploying the developer tool for an unexpectedly diverse array of tasks. "Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven," Cherny wrote on X. "These use cases are diverse and surprising — the reason is that the underlying Claude Agent is the best agent, and Opus 4.5 is the best model."
Recognizing this shadow usage, Anthropic effectively stripped the command-line complexity from their developer tool to create a consumer-friendly interface. In its blog post announcing the feature, Anthropic explained that developers "quickly began using it for almost everything else," which "prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude in the very same way."
Inside the folder-based architecture that lets Claude read, edit, and create files on your computer
Unlike a standard chat interface where a user pastes text for analysis, Cowork requires a different level of trust and access. Users designate a specific folder on their local machine that Claude can access. Within that sandbox, the AI agent can read existing files, modify them, or create entirely new ones.
Anthropic offers several illustrative examples: reorganizing a cluttered downloads folder by sorting and intelligently renaming each file, generating a spreadsheet of expenses from a collection of receipt screenshots, or drafting a report from scattered notes across multiple documents.
"In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder," the company explained on X. "Try it to create a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft from scattered notes." The architecture relies on what is known as an "agentic loop." When a user assigns a task, the AI does not merely generate a text response. Instead, it formulates a plan, executes steps in parallel, checks its own work, and asks for clarification if it hits a roadblock. Users can queue multiple tasks and let Claude process them simultaneously — a workflow Anthropic describes as feeling "much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker."
The system is built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK, meaning it shares the same underlying architecture as Claude Code. Anthropic notes that Cowork "can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks."
The recursive loop where AI builds AI: Claude Code reportedly wrote much of Claude Cowork
Perhaps the most remarkable detail surrounding Cowork's launch is the speed at which the tool was reportedly built — highlighting a recursive feedback loop where AI tools are being used to build better AI tools.
During a livestream hosted by Dan Shipper, Felix Rieseberg, an Anthropic employee, confirmed that the team built Cowork in approximately a week and a half.
Alex Volkov, who covers AI developments, expressed surprise at the timeline: "Holy shit Anthropic built 'Cowork' in the last... week and a half?!" This prompted immediate speculation about how much of Cowork was itself built by Claude Code. Simon Smith, EVP of Generative AI at Klick Health, put it bluntly on X: "Claude Code wrote all of Claude Cowork. Can we all agree that we're in at least somewhat of a recursive improvement loop here?"
The implication is profound: Anthropic's AI coding agent may have substantially contributed to building its own non-technical sibling product. If true, this is one of the most visible examples yet of AI systems being used to accelerate their own development and expansion — a strategy that could widen the gap between AI labs that successfully deploy their own agents internally and those that do not.
Connectors, browser automation, and skills extend Cowork's reach beyond the local file system
Cowork doesn't operate in isolation. The feature integrates with Anthropic's existing ecosystem of connectors — tools that link Claude to external information sources and services such as Asana, Notion, PayPal, and other supported partners. Users who have configured these connections in the standard Claude interface can leverage them within Cowork sessions.
Additionally, Cowork can pair with Claude in Chrome, Anthropic's browser extension, to execute tasks requiring web access. This combination allows the agent to navigate websites, click buttons, fill forms, and extract information from the internet — all while operating from the desktop application.
"Cowork includes a number of novel UX and safety features that we think make the product really special," Cherny explained, highlighting "a built-in VM [virtual machine] for isolation, out of the box support for browser automation, support for all your claude.ai data connectors, asking you for clarification when it's unsure."
Anthropic has also introduced an initial set of "skills" specifically designed for Cowork that enhance Claude's ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. These build on the Skills for Claude framework the company announced in October, which provides specialized instruction sets Claude can load for particular types of tasks.
Why Anthropic is warning users that its own AI agent could delete their files
The transition from a chatbot that suggests edits to an agent that makes edits introduces significant risk. An AI that can organize files can, theoretically, delete them.
In a notable display of transparency, Anthropic devoted considerable space in its announcement to warning users about Cowork's potential dangers — an unusual approach for a product launch.
The company explicitly acknowledges that Claude "can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it's instructed to." Because Claude might occasionally misinterpret instructions, Anthropic urges users to provide "very clear guidance" about sensitive operations.
More concerning is the risk of prompt injection attacks — a technique where malicious actors embed hidden instructions in content Claude might encounter online, potentially causing the agent to bypass safeguards or take harmful actions.
"We've built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections," Anthropic wrote, "but agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude's real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry."
The company characterized these risks as inherent to the current state of AI agent technology rather than unique to Cowork. "These risks aren't new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you're using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation," the announcement notes.
Anthropic's desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft Copilot
The launch of Cowork places Anthropic in direct competition with Microsoft, which has spent years attempting to integrate its Copilot AI into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.
However, Anthropic's approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application.
What distinguishes Anthropic's approach is its bottom-up evolution. Rather than designing an AI assistant and retrofitting agent capabilities, Anthropic built a powerful coding agent first — Claude Code — and is now abstracting its capabilities for broader audiences. This technical lineage may give Cowork more robust agentic behavior from the start.
Claude Code has generated significant enthusiasm among developers since its initial launch as a command-line tool in late 2024. The company expanded access with a web interface in October 2025, followed by a Slack integration in December. Cowork is the next logical step: bringing the same agentic architecture to users who may never touch a terminal.
Who can access Cowork now, and what's coming next for Windows and other platforms
For now, Cowork remains exclusive to Claude Max subscribers using the macOS desktop application. Users on other subscription tiers — Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise — can join a waitlist for future access.
Anthropic has signaled clear intentions to expand the feature's reach. The blog post explicitly mentions plans to add cross-device sync and bring Cowork to Windows as the company learns from the research preview.
Cherny set expectations appropriately, describing the product as "early and raw, similar to what Claude Code felt like when it first launched."
To access Cowork, Max subscribers can download or update the Claude macOS app and click on "Cowork" in the sidebar.
The real question facing enterprise AI adoption
For technical decision-makers, the implications of Cowork extend beyond any single product launch. The bottleneck for AI adoption is shifting — no longer is model intelligence the limiting factor, but rather workflow integration and user trust.
Anthropic's goal, as the company puts it, is to make working with Claude feel less like operating a tool and more like delegating to a colleague. Whether mainstream users are ready to hand over folder access to an AI that might misinterpret their instructions remains an open question.
But the speed of Cowork's development — a major feature built in ten days, possibly by the company's own AI — previews a future where the capabilities of these systems compound faster than organizations can evaluate them. The chatbot has learned to use a file manager. What it learns to use next is anyone's guess.

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles Intel and Hugging Face collaborated to demonstrate the real-world value of upgrading to Google’s latest C4 Virtual Machine (VM) running on Intel Xeon 6 processors (codenamed Granite Rapids (GNR)). We specifically wanted to benchmark improvements in the text generation performance of OpenAI GPT OSS Large Language Model(LLM). The results are in, and they are impressive, demonstrating a 1.7x improvement in Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) over the previous-generation Google C3 VM instances. The Google Cloud C4 VM instance further resulted in: 1.4x to 1.7x TPOT throughput/vCPU/dollar
Lower price per hour over C3 VM Introduction GPT OSS is a common name for an open-source Mixture of Experts (MoE) model released by OpenAI. An MoE model is a deep neural network architecture that uses specialized “expert” sub-networks and a “gating network” to decide which experts to use for a given input. MoE models allow you to scale your model capacity efficiently without linearly scaling compute costs. They also allow for specialization, where different “experts” learn different skills, allowing them to adapt to diverse data distributions.
Even with very large parameters, only a small subset of experts is activated per token, making CPU inference viable.
Intel and Hugging Face collaborated to merge an expert execution optimization (PR #40304)

### 19. `EN` [The creator of Claude Code just revealed his workflow, and developers are losing their minds](data/articles/c2e433d6dc0060138f55b9de14c8a605.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
When the creator of the world's most advanced coding agent speaks, Silicon Valley doesn't just listen — it takes notes.
For the past week, the engineering community has been dissecting a thread on X from Boris Cherny, the creator and head of Claude Code at Anthropic. What began as a casual sharing of his personal terminal setup has spiraled into a viral manifesto on the future of software development, with industry insiders calling it a watershed moment for the startup. "If you're not reading the Claude Code best practices straight from its creator, you're behind as a programmer," wrote Jeff Tang, a prominent voice in the developer community. Kyle McNease, another industry observer, went further, declaring that with Cherny's "game-changing updates," Anthropic is "on fire," potentially facing "their ChatGPT moment."
The excitement stems from a paradox: Cherny's workflow is surprisingly simple, yet it allows a single human to operate with the output capacity of a small engineering department. As one user noted on X after implementing Cherny's setup, the experience "feels more like Starcraft" than traditional coding — a shift from typing syntax to commanding autonomous units.
Here is an analysis of the workflow that is reshaping how software gets built, straight from the architect himself. How running five AI agents at once turns coding into a real-time strategy game
The most striking revelation from Cherny's disclosure is that he does not code in a linear fashion. In the traditional "inner loop" of development, a programmer writes a function, tests it, and moves to the next. Cherny, however, acts as a fleet commander.
"I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal," Cherny wrote. "I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input."
By utilizing iTerm2 system notifications, Cherny effectively manages five simultaneous work streams. While one agent runs a test suite, another refactors a legacy module, and a third drafts documentation. He also runs "5-10 Claudes on claude.ai" in his browser, using a "teleport" command to hand off sessions between the web and his local machine.
This validates the "do more with less" strategy articulated by Anthropic President Daniela Amodei earlier this week. While competitors like OpenAI pursue trillion-dollar infrastructure build-outs, Anthropic is proving that superior orchestration of existing models can yield exponential productivity gains.
The counterintuitive case for choosing the slowest, smartest model
In a surprising move for an industry obsessed with latency, Cherny revealed that he exclusively uses Anthropic's heaviest, slowest model: Opus 4.5.
"I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything," Cherny explained. "It's the best coding model I've ever used, and even though it's bigger &amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it's better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end."
For enterprise technology leaders, this is a critical insight. The bottleneck in modern AI development isn't the generation speed of the token; it is the human time spent correcting the AI's mistakes. Cherny's workflow suggests that paying the "compute tax" for a smarter model upfront eliminates the "correction tax" later.
One shared file turns every AI mistake into a permanent lesson
Cherny also detailed how his team solves the problem of AI amnesia. Standard large language models do not "remember" a company's specific coding style or architectural decisions from one session to the next.
To address this, Cherny's team maintains a single file named CLAUDE.md in their git repository. "Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time," he wrote.

Back to Articles What Is OpenEnv? The Calendar Gym: A Production-Grade Benchmark What We Learned Looking Ahead Appendix: Common error cases in tool use Specific error cases found in the wild AI agents often perform impressively in controlled research settings, yet struggle when deployed in real-world systems where they must reason across multiple steps, interact with real tools and APIs, operate under partial information, and recover from errors in stateful, permissioned environments—highlighting a persistent gap between research success and production reliability.
OpenEnv is an open-source framework from Meta and Hugging Face designed to address this challenge by standardizing how agents interact with real environments. As part of this collaboration, Turing contributed a production-grade calendar management environment to study tool-using agents under realistic constraints such as access control, temporal reasoning, and multi-agent coordination.
In this post, we explore how OpenEnv works in practice, why calendars serve as a powerful benchmark for real-world agent evaluation, and what our findings reveal about the current limitations of tool-using agents.

Everything links together. The community can submit results via PR. Verified badges prove that the results can be reproduced. Evaluation is broken Let's be real about where we are with evals in 2026. MMLU is saturated above 91%. GSM8K hit 94%+. HumanEval is conquered. Yet some models that ace benchmarks still can't reliably browse the web, write production code, or handle multi-step tasks without hallucinating, based on usage reports. There is a clear gap between benchmark scores and real-world performance.
Furthermore, there is another gap within reported benchmark scores. Multiple sources report different results. From Model Cards, to papers, to evaluation platforms, there is no alignment in reported scores. The result is that the community lacks a single source of truth. What We're Shipping Decentralized and transparent evaluation reporting.
We are going to take evaluations on the Hugging Face Hub in a new direction by decentralizing reporting and allowing the entire community to openly report scores for benchmarks. At first, we will start with a shortlist of 4 benchmarks and over time we’ll expand to the most relev

Back to Articles It has become increasingly challenging to assess whether a model’s
reported improvements reflect genuine advances or variations in

mirrors benchmark tasks. The NVIDIA Nemotron approach to openness
addresses this by publishing transparent and reproducible evaluation
recipes that make results independently verifiable.
NVIDIA released Nemotron 3 Nano 30B

clear. Alongside the model card, we are publishing the complete

anyone can rerun the evaluation pipeline, inspect the artifacts, and
analyze the outcomes independently.
We believe that open innovation is the foundation of AI progress. This
level of transparency matters because most model evaluations omit
critical details. Configs, prompts, harness versions, runtime settings,
and logs are often missing or underspecified, and even small differences
in these parameters can materially change results. Without a complete

Back to Articles Ethics in Practice: Consent as System Infrastructure The Technical Details Approach Unlocking the Voice Consent Gate In this blog post, we introduce the idea of a 'voice consent gate' to support voice cloning with consent. We provide an example Space and accompanying code to start the ball rolling on the idea.
Realistic voice generation technology has gotten uncannily good in the past few years. In some situations, it’s possible to generate a synthetic voice that sounds almost exactly like the voice of a real person. And today, what once felt like science fiction is reality: Voice cloning. With just a few seconds of recorded speech, anyone’s voice can be made to say almost anything. Voice generation, and in particular the subtask of voice cloning, has notable risks and benefits. The risks of “deepfakes”, such as the cloned voice of former President Biden used in robocalls, can mislead people into thinking that people have said things that they haven’t said. On the other hand, voice cloning can be a powerful beneficial tool, helping people who’ve lost the ability to speak communicate in their own voice again, or assisting people in learning new languages and dialects.
So how do we create meaningful use without malicious use? We’re exploring one possible answer: a voice consent gate. That’s a system where a voice can be cloned only when the

When given a query, they would easily manage ambiguity in instructions, construct step-by-step plans, correctly identify necessary resources, execute those plans without getting sidetracked, and adapt to unexpected events, all while maintaining accuracy and avoiding hallucinations.
However, developing agents and testing these behaviors is no small feat: if you have ever tried to debug your own agent, you’ve probably observed how tedious and frustrating this can be. Existing evaluation environments are tightly coupled with the tasks they evaluate, lack real-world flexibility, and do not reflect the messy reality of open-world agents: simulated pages never fail to load, events don’t spontaneously emerge, and asynchronous chaos is absent.

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles The past year has been all about giving LLMs more tools and autonomy to solve more complex and open ended tasks. The goal of the Jupyter Agent is to give the model the ultimate tool: code execution. A natural way to display multi-step code execution together with reasoning is within a Jupyter Notebook, which consists of code and markdown cells. So we built Jupyter Agent to act as an agent that can execute code directly inside a Jupyter notebook and use this environment to solve data analysis and data science tasks. Think of it like Cursor, but living natively inside your data science workflow.We built a demo of this vision with Qwen-3 Coder, currently one of the strongest coding models. This is a follow-up to our earlier work on jupyter-agent (v1).
While large models are starting to show useful behavior, the key question is how we can continue improving them. To this end, we focus on strengthening smaller models to perform well on agentic data science tasks as they currently struggle to compete with the large models.
The goal of this project is to build a pipeline to first generate high-quality training data, then fine-tune an existing small model, and finally evaluate whether the model's performance improves on relevant benchmarks.
Let’s begin with the last step: selecting a strong benchmark for evaluating models on data science tasks.

Back to Articles What will change for llama.cpp, the open source project and the community? Technical focus Our long term vision We are super happy to announce that GGML, creators of Llama.cpp, are joining HF in order to keep future AI open. Georgi Gerganov and team are joining HF with the goal of scaling and supporting the community behind ggml and llama.cpp as Local AI continues to make exponential progress in the coming years.
We've been working with Georgi and team for quite some time (we even have awesome core contributors to llama.cpp like Son and Alek in the team already) so this has been a very natural process.
llama.cpp is the fundamental building block for local inference, and transformers is the fundamental building block for model definition, so this is basically a match made in heaven. What will change for llama.cpp, the open source project and the community? Not much – Georgi and team still dedicate 100% of their time maintaining llama.cpp and have full autonomy and leadership on the technical directions and the community.

DeepMath is an aligned math reasoning agent built on Qwen3-4B Thinking and fine-tuned with GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization). Instead of verbose text, the model emits tiny Python snippets for intermediate steps, runs them in a secure sandbox, and folds the results back into its reasoning, reducing errors and output length. The agent is implemented using the smolagents library.
We evaluate DeepMath on four math datasets: MATH500, AIME, HMMT, and HLE, and show that: The math agent alone reduces output lengths by up to 66%, while often improving accuracy. GRPO training improves the agent performance even further, in almost all benchmarks.

Getting Involved It's been fantastic to see the community dive into our new MiniMax M2, with many highlighting its impressive skills in complex agentic tasks. This is particularly exciting for me, as my work was centered on the agent alignment part of its post-training. In this post, I'd like to share some of the key insights and lessons we learned during that process. The Real Agent Alignment Problem: Benchmarks or Reality? If you've worked with LLM Agents, you've felt this pain: the same model can feel brilliant in one framework and useless in another. An agent might crush a tool-use leaderboard but fail spectacularly at a simple, real-world task. This gap between benchmark performance and practical usability is one of the biggest challenges in the field.
When we designed M2, we knew we had to tackle this problem head-on. This led us to two core, and sometimes conflicting, objectives: Excel on Open-Source Benchmarks.

Back to Articles The Problem The Solution The RFCs Use cases What’s Next With tools like TRL, TorchForge and verl, the open-source community has shown how to scale AI across complex compute infrastructure. But compute is only one side of the coin. The other side is the developer community; the people and tools that make agentic systems possible. That’s why Meta and Hugging Face are partnering to launch the OpenEnv Hub: a shared and open community hub for agentic environments.
Agentic environments define everything an agent needs to perform a task: the tools, APIs, credentials, execution context, and nothing else. They bring clarity, safety, and sandboxed control to agent behavior.
These environments can be used for both training and deployment, and serve as the foundation for scalable agentic development. The Problem Modern AI agents can act autonomously across thousands of tasks. However, a large language model isn’t enough to get those tasks to actually run — it needs access to the right tools. Exposing millions of tools directly to a model isn’t reasonable (or safe). Instead, we need agentic environments: secure, semantically clear sandboxes that define exactly what’s required for a task, and nothing more. These environments handle the critical details: Clear semantics about what a task needs

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles TL;DR – We’re excited to introduce the beta version of the Retrieval Embedding Benchmark (RTEB), a new benchmark designed to reliably evaluate the retrieval accuracy of embedding models for real-world applications. Existing benchmarks struggle to measure true generalization, while RTEB addresses this with a hybrid strategy of open and private datasets. Its goal is simple: to create a fair, transparent, and application-focused standard for measuring how models perform on data they haven’t seen before.
The performance of many AI applications, from RAG and agents to recommendation systems, is fundamentally limited by the quality of search and retrieval. As such, accurately measuring the retrieval quality of embedding models is a common pain point for developers. How do you really know how well a model will perform in the wild?
This is where things get tricky. The current standard for evaluation often relies on a model's "zero-shot" performance on public benchmarks. However, this is, at best, an approximation of a model's true generalization capabilities. When models are repeatedly evaluated against the same public datasets, a gap emerges between their reported scores and their actual performance on new, unseen data. Performance Discrepancy Between Public and Closed Datasets To address these challenges, we developed RTEB, a b

Back to Articles Enter SyGra: One Framework for Every Data Challenge Why SyGra Matters SyGra Architecture Final Thoughts References When we think about building a model - be it a Large Language Model (LLM) or a Small Language Model (SLM) - the first thing we need is data. While a vast amount of open data is available, it rarely comes in the exact format required to train or align models.
In practice, we often face scenarios where the raw data isn't enough. We need data that is more structured, domain-specific, complex, or aligned with the task at hand. Let's look at some common situations: Complex Scenarios Missing You start with a simple dataset, but the model fails on advanced reasoning tasks. How do you generate more complex datasets to strengthen performance? Knowledge Base to Q&amp;A You already have a knowledge base, but it's not in Q&amp;A format. How can you transform it into a usable question-answering dataset? From SFT to DPO You've prepared a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset. But now you want to align your model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). How can you generate preference pairs? Depth of Questions You have a Q&amp;A dataset, but the questions are shallow. How can you create in-depth, multi-turn, or reasoning-heavy questions? Domain-Specific Mid-Training

Back to Articles Risk Rubric, a new Standardized Assessment of Risk for models What we found (as of September 2025) Conclusion Building trust in the open model ecosystem through standardized risk assessment
More than 500,000 models can be found on the Hugging Face hub, but it’s not always clear to users how to choose the best model for them, notably on the security aspects. Developers might find a model that perfectly fits their use case, but have no systematic way to evaluate its security posture, privacy implications, or potential failure modes. As models become more powerful and adoption accelerates, we need equally rapid progress in AI safety and security reporting. We're therefore excited to announce RiskRubric.ai, a novel initiative led by Cloud Security Alliance and Noma Security, with contributions by Haize Labs and Harmonic Security, for standardized and transparent risk assessment in the AI model ecosystem. Risk Rubric, a new Standardized Assessment of Risk for models RiskRubric.ai provides consistent, comparable risk scores across the entire model landscape, by evaluating models across six pillars: transparency, reliability, security, privacy, safety, and reputation. The platform's approach aligns perfectly with open-source values: rigorous, transparent, and reproducible. Using Noma Security capabilities to automate the effort, each mo

In our previous LeRobotDataset:v2 release, we stored one episode per file, hitting file-system limitations when scaling datasets to millions of episodes. LeRobotDataset:v3 packs multiple episodes in a single file, using relational metadata to retrieve information at the individual episode level from multi-episode files. The new format also natively supports accessing datasets in streaming mode, allowing to process large datasets on the fly.We provide a one-liner util to convert all datasets in the LeRobotDataset format to the new format, and are very excited to share this milestone with the community ahead of our next stable release!

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles FilBench What did we learn from FilBench? Finding #1: Although region-specific LLMs still lag behind GPT-4, collecting data to train these models is still a promising direction Finding #2: Filipino translation is still a difficult task for LLMs Finding #3: Open LLMs Remain a Cost-Effective Choice for Filipino Language Tasks Does your LLM work on Philippine Languages? Try it on FilBench! Acknowledgements Citation As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our lives, it becomes crucial to assess whether they reflect the nuances and capabilities of specific language communities.
For example, Filipinos are among the most active ChatGPT users globally, ranking fourth in ChatGPT traffic (behind the United States, India, and Brazil [1] [2]), but despite this strong usage, we lack a clear understanding of how LLMs perform for their languages, such as Tagalog and Cebuano.
Most of the existing evidence is anecdotal, such as screenshots of ChatGPT responding in Filipino as proof that it is fluent.
What we need instead is a systematic evaluation of LLM capabilities in Philippine languages. That’s why we developed FilBench: a comprehensive evaluation suite to assess the capabilities of LLMs for Tagalog, Filipino (the standardized form of Tagalog), and Cebuano, on fluency, linguistic and translati

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles GPT OSS is a hugely anticipated open-weights release by OpenAI, designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases. It comprises two models: a big one with 117B parameters (gpt-oss-120b), and a smaller one with 21B parameters (gpt-oss-20b). Both are mixture-of-experts (MoEs) and use a 4-bit quantization scheme (MXFP4), enabling fast inference (thanks to fewer active parameters, see details below) while keeping resource usage low. The large model fits on a single H100 GPU, while the small one runs within 16GB of memory and is perfect for consumer hardware and on-device applications.
To make it even better and more impactful for the community, the models are licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, along with a minimal usage policy: We aim for our tools to be used safely, responsibly, and democratically, while maximizing your control over how you use them. By using gpt-oss, you agree to comply with all applicable law. According to OpenAI, this release is a meaningful step in their commitment to the open-source ecosystem, in line with their stated mission to make the benefits of AI broadly accessible. Many use cases rely on private and/or local deployments, and we at Hugging Face are super excited to welcome OpenAI to the community. We believe these will be long-lived, inspiri

**Source:** The Verge | **Keyword:** `AI`
Welcome to the weekend, folks! The Reviews and Guides team here at The Verge is gearing up for all things Unpacked, but Samsung isn’t the only one readying new phones. Google just announced the Pixel 10A, which, for you early adopters, is already up for preorder with a $100 gift card. Elsewhere in deal land, you’ll find steep discounts on mopping vacuums, slight discounts on Soundcore’s cheap ANC headphones, and a rare discount on a new PC controller with swiveling sticks.
So, let’s get to it, shall we?
We finally have a release date for the Pixel 10A: March 5th. What’s more, if you’re thinking about picking up Google’s latest phone, you can already preorder the base-model configuration at Amazon and Best Buy with 128GB of storage and a $100 gift card for $499. Alternatively, Amazon is offering it with a free pair of the Pixel Buds 2A, a fantastic set of recently released earbuds that typically retail for $130.
Despite being a pretty minimal update, Google’s forthcoming Android handset is a pretty solid deal. It doesn’t adopt a lot of features from the flagship Pixel 10 series; however, last year’s Tensor G4 chip is still speedy enough for most tasks, satellite SOS is handy, and you get slightly faster wired and wireless charging. More importantly, it still comes with seven years of OS and security updates, which, personally, I’d take over Magic Cue, Pixel Screenshots, and other AI-based tools any day of the week.
Read our hands-on impressions.
Google Pixel 10A Where to Buy: $599 $499 at Amazon (free $100 gift card) $629 $499 at Amazon (free Pixel Buds 2A) $599 $499 at Best Buy (free $100 gift card) Twelve. That’s how many AC outlets Anker’s 351 Power Strip — which is now available in black or white from Amazon and Anker for $23.99 ($6 off) — packs into its 9.65-inch, surge-protected build. The beefy power strip also features a 20W USB-C port and two USB-A ports, both of which can deliver up to 15W of juice. Just keep in mind that, like with most power strips and like-minded chargers, you’ll have to split power amongst the USB ports, which are limited to a max output of 15W when charging multiple devices simultaneously.
Anker 351 Power Strip Where to Buy: $29.99 $23.99 at Amazon $29.99 $23.99 at Anker (with code WS7DV2YWISTS) I’m admittedly not a huge fan of fighting games — I have no patience for learning combos, dear readers — but the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot seems like a good compromise if I were forced to choose between a traditional controller and one specifically built for hammering out hadokens. And now, the novel gamepad is on sale at both Amazon and Best Buy for $99.99 ($40 off), its lowest price to date.
Although Turtle Beach’s wireless PC controller offers a slew of welcome components, including drift-free Hall effect joysticks and adjustable trigger stops, its defining feature is a pair of rotating modules that can “pivot” to reveal a customizable controller layout that’s better suited for retro titles and fighting games. You also get programmable back buttons, the ability to save up to five profiles, and a 3.5mm audio jack, not to mention compatibility with mobile devices over Bluetooth and Xbox consoles via a wired connection.
Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot Where to Buy: $139.99 $99.99 at Amazon $139.99 $99.99 at Best Buy If you’re looking for a cheap(ish) set of noise-canceling headphones, Soundcore’s Space One are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and directly from Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) in all four colors for $79.99 ($20 off), matching their second-best price to date.
During Cyber Monday last year, our own John Higgins waxed poetic about the over-ear cans, namely because they deliver impressive sound and comfort for the price. The sound quality and ANC don’t rival the flagships from Sony or Bose, sure, but you can try over 20 different presets or tweak the sound yourself using the eight-band equalizer in Anker’s companion app. They can also last up to 40 hours with ANC enabled, meaning you should be able to fly from New York to Singapore and back again without ever having to charge them.
Soundcore Space One Where to Buy: $99 $79.99 at Amazon $99.99 $79.99 at Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) $99.99 $79.99 at Walmart More ways to save this weekend
Google’s refreshed Nest Cam Indoor, which launched in October, is already down to a new low of $74.99 ($25 off) at Amazon. The wired camera supports 2K HDR video and offers a taller and wider field of view than prior models, along with a new sensor for full-color low-light video. It also comes in a new berry color, which, for better or worse, seems to be Google’s latest obsession.

**Source:** Numerama Tech | **Keyword:** `IA`
Lorsque m'est venue l'idée saugrenue de proposer un « top » des Zelda pour célébrer les 40 ans de la franchise, je me suis immédiatement posé une question : existe-t-il une licence dont il est potentiellement aussi difficile de classer les épisodes en termes de qualité globale ? Face à l'excellence quasi unanimement constatée des épisodes de la série principale, le défi semblait insurmontable, et pourtant, j'ai quand même décidé de le relever. Ce top ne va assurément plaire à personne, mais ça en dit long sur le niveau stratosphérique des jeux The Legend of Zelda dans leur ensemble.

Anomalies thermiques prévues entre le 23 février et le 2 mars 2026 - modèle ECMWF Si les températures ont déjà connu une légère hausse ces derniers jours, ce n’est rien en comparaison de ce qui nous attend cette semaine. Le courant va en effet se diriger vers le sud, permettant à l’air chaud en provenance du Maroc de se propager directement sur la France. La Belgique, l’Allemagne et la Suisse seront également touchées par cette vague de douceur en Europe occidentale. Jusqu'à 12°C au-dessus de la normale ! Tout au long de la semaine, les températures seront largement supérieures aux normales saisonnières pour une fin février, notamment entre mardi et mercredi, lorsque le soleil illuminera les trois quarts du pays. Les écarts à la normale pourraient atteindre sept à dix degrés mardi, et même dix à douze degrés mercredi ! Anomalies de températures maximales prévues mardi et mercredi Plus de 15° presque partout durant quatre jours Entre lundi et jeudi, les températures dépasseront les quinze degrés Celsius l’après-midi sur presque tout le territoire français. La journée la plus douce, voire localement chaude, sera probablement celle de mercredi, car la grande douceur qui aura déjà touché le quart sud-ouest la veille remontera vers les régions du Nord. Températures maximales prévues entre lundi 23 et jeudi 26 février selon METEO-VILLES.COM Peut-être quelques records mensuels battus ? Il sera difficile d’atteindre les records mensuels de douceur pour un mois de février, qui s’élèvent à près de trente degrés dans l’extrême Sud-Ouest et à vingt à vingt-trois degrés sur la plupart des régions. Néanmoins, à Paris, il est possible de se rapprocher des records pour une fin février. Le record pour la troisième décade de février est de 21,4 degrés en 1960. Pour un 24 février, le record est de 20,3 degrés en 1990, et pour un 25 février, il a fait jusqu’à 17,9 degrés à Paris Montsouris en 2019. Records de températures maximales pour un mois de février - Meteociel Pour une fin février, les années de référence sont donc 1960, 1990 et 2019.

La neige est très abondante à Val d'Isère en Savoie actuellement ! - Photographie : Station Val d'Isère Même si la neige reste timide en plaine depuis le début du mois de janvier sur la France, le constat est tout autre en montagne. Avec le temps très humide et perturbé de ces dernières semaines, la neige se montre en effet particulièrement abondante sur la majorité de nos massifs, notamment en moyenne montagne où l'épaisseur est parfois impressionnante, même pour une mi-février. Nous vous proposons donc un petit tour de nos massifs. Enneigement MOYEN par massif en bas et en haut des pistes au vendredi 13 février 2026 - relevés Météo-France Voici la liste des stations de sports d'hiver les plus enneigées en haut des pistes (source : Meteo-France) : Piau Engaly : 350 cm La Rosière 1850 : 300 cm Puy Saint-Vincent : 279 cm Saint-François-Longchamp : 265 cm Bonneval sur Arc : 262 cm Flaine : 260 cm Alpe d’Huez : 255 cm Praloup : 255 cm Arêches-Beaufort : 240 cm Chamrousse : 237 cm Les 2 Alpes : 235 cm Alpes C'est sur la partie nord du massif que les quantités de neige sont les plus importantes en station en cette mi-février 2026. On relève en effet en général entre 90 et 110 cm de neige en bas des pistes de la Haute-Savoie au Queyras en passant par l'Isère, parfois plus comme au Grand-Bornand (74) à 1430m d'altitude où on mesure 155 cm de neige ce 13 février. Les quantités sont en général comprises entre 200 et 300 cm en haut des pistes, là aussi des valeurs particulièrement élevées. L'enneigement est exceptionnel à La Rosière (Savoie), ce vendredi 13 février 2026 - cliché Alexandra Brochard via @MeteoExpress Attention toutefois, ces quantités de neige particulièrement importantes entraînent un risque d'avalanche très élevé en cette fin de semaine. Plusieurs avalanches notables ont d'ailleurs été observées ce jeudi 12 février sur le nord des Alpes. Le sud du massif n'est pas non plus en reste avec là aussi des quantités notables. On mesure en général entre 40 et 60 cm de neige en bas des pistes dans les stations des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence et des Alpes-Maritimes et jusqu'à 200 cm sur les sommets. La nivôse de Millefonts (06) mesure par exemple 147 cm de neige à 2430 m d'altitude, soit 86 cm de plus que l'année dernière à la même période ! Pyrénées Le massif pyrénéen est également particulièrement concerné par les chutes de neige ces dernières semaines. Que ce soit l'est ou l'ouest du massif, toutes les stations observent d'importantes quantités de neige en cette mi-février 2026. Certains secteurs des Pyrénées-Orientales ont même relevé des quantités de neige qui n'avaient plus été vues depuis près de 30 ans et d'autres ont atteint des records au début du mois de février ! Si les quantités restent raisonnables en bas des pistes (entre 20 et 40 cm en général) en raison de plusieurs redoux plus ou moins notables depuis le début du mois de février, on relève le plus souvent 200 à 250 cm de neige sur les sommets ! Corse Comme pour les Pyrénées et les Alpes, le temps agité et très humide de ces dernières semaines a apporté une couche de neige particulièrement importante sur les massifs de l'île de beauté. Celle-ci est même plus importante que dans certains massifs alpins avec en général entre 30 et 50 cm à moyenne altitude et jusqu'à 250 cm sur sommets de la région, localement plus ! On relève par exemple 277 cm à la nivôse de Maniccia (2360m), 157 cm de plus que l'année dernière à la même date et presque 2 m de plus qu'en février 2024 ! La station de Bastelica dans le Val d'Ese a même pu rouvrir ses portes au début du mois de février après 3 ans sans neige ! Les autres massifs français sont malheureusement un peu moins bien fournis en terme de neige car moins élevés. L'air globalement assez doux pour la période a en effet limité les chutes de neige abondante sur le Jura, les Vosges et le Massif Central ces dernières semaines en plus de quelques journées de pluie jusqu'aux sommets de ces massifs, entraînant un lessivage parfois notable. On ne relève en général pas plus de 20-25 cm sur les sommets de ces reliefs, ce qui est à contrario déficitaire. Encore et toujours des chutes de neige en vue ! D'autres chutes de neige abondantes sont prévues d'ici la fin du mois (et notamment d'ici le 24 février) à tel point qu'il pourrait encore tomber 1 m à 2,50 m supplémentaires en haut des pistes, notamment sur le nord des Alpes et l'Ouest des Pyrénées ! Les épaisseurs pourraient ainsi atteindre localement 5 m voire davantage...

La neige fera son retour en Île-de-France ce dimanche 15 février, tout comme sur d'autres régions du nord et du nord-est de la France - Image d'illustration (vue depuis notre caméra meteo-paris.com) Des chutes de neige relativement éphémères auront lieu ce dimanche jusqu'en plaine entre les Hauts-de-France, tout le Bassin parisien et le nord-est du pays. D'autres épisodes pourraient avoir lieu la semaine prochaine. Retour très bref de la neige en plaine L'invasion polaire continentale qui a eu lieu samedi, fut de courte durée, rapidement remplacée par une poussée océanique plus douce. Si l’air froid persiste sur une grande partie de la France ce dimanche, un nouveau front pluvieux traverse rapidement le pays par l’Ouest. Ce front est accompagné d’un net redoux en altitude, mais la pluie est temporairement précédée de neige pendant quelques heures, là où la couche d’air froid sera suffisamment épaisse. Dimanche matin, la Normandie et l’Île-de-France ont connu des chutes de neige moins importantes que prévues, la perturbation s’étant scindée en deux. La neige a principalement touché un axe s’étendant du Limousin aux Pays de la Loire et au Centre, avant de se réactiver sur les Hauts-de-France, la Champagne-Ardenne et la Lorraine dans l’après-midi et la soirée. Évolution prévue des zones enneigées entre dimanche 8h et lundi 3h – (réactualisation de dimanche 6h - Modèle CEP via meteociel) Quelques centimètres, notamment sur les plateaux Ainsi, les cumul de neige ont été revus à la baisse de la Normandie à l'Île-de-France, mais pas forcément ailleurs. Paris n'a par exemple pas du tout été blanchie. Dimanche en fin de journée, les épaisseurs de neige pourraient dépasser 5 cm entre le nord du département de l'Aisne, ainsi que les Ardennes et le nord de la Lorraine. Épaisseurs de neige maximales prévue pour le dimanche 15 février 2026 (réactualisation de dimanche 6h) – Météo-Villes Une semaine à risque sur les régions du Nord et du nord-est Après le redoux de dimanche après-midi, l’air froid reprendra rapidement le dessus sur la moitié nord dès le début de la semaine. Une dépression, déviée vers le sud par l’air froid persistant au nord, devrait s’échouer sur la France entre mercredi soir et jeudi. Les précipitations, sous cet air froid, pourraient se transformer en neige. Il est cependant encore trop tôt pour déterminer précisément les régions concernées. Des chutes de neige significatives sont possibles, avec un risque accru entre la Normandie, l’Île-de-France et toutes les régions situées au nord de la Seine.

Le dernier mois réellement hivernal en France remonte à février 2018, marqué par deux épisodes importants de chutes de neige et par des températures particulièrement basses, atteignant des niveaux qui n’ont pas (encore) été observés cette année. Sur les 95 vagues de froid observées en France depuis 1900, seule une vague de froid a été observée après 2015 et aucune depuis 2020… La dernière, date donc de février 2018... Source : Serge Saka Une première vague de froid au début du mois Entre le 4 et le 9 février 2018, la France replonge en plein hiver. Un puissant épisode de froid et de neige concerne près des deux tiers du pays, paralysant temporairement plusieurs régions. Tout commence le 5 février, lorsqu’une perturbation venue de Méditerranée remonte vers le nord. La neige tombe jusqu’en plaine sur le Massif central, gagne la vallée du Rhône, la Bourgogne, puis atteint l’Île-de-France en fin de journée. Le 6 février, la situation se complique nettement. Un épisode neigeux majeur frappe l’Île-de-France et les Pays de la Loire. Les chutes deviennent soutenues et tiennent au sol, y compris dans la capitale. Les conséquences sont spectaculaires : un record de 739 kilomètres d’embouteillages est enregistré autour de Paris, piégeant de nombreux automobilistes. Au matin du 7 février, le paysage est est blanc sur les 2/3 du territoire avec une épaisseurs de neige remarquables dans le Bassin parisien. On mesure jusqu’à 25 cm de neige localement, notamment à Vendôme, Dreux ou Versailles, et 12 cm à Paris-Montsouris. Le 8 février, le ciel se dégage mais le froid s’intensifie. Sur des sols enneigés, les températures plongent entre –13°C et –14°C localement, et descendent autour de –6°C à –7°C dans les aéroports parisiens. Enfin, le 9 février, une nouvelle perturbation océanique traverse l’air froid et apporte de nouvelles chutes de neige du Massif central vers l’Île-de-France et le nord du pays, prolongeant cet épisode hivernal marquant. La neige des 6 et 7 février 2018 à Paris où il tombe 12 cm - meteo-paris.com et Alexandre Slowik Une seconde vague de froid, intense, à la fin du mois Du lundi 26 février au jeudi 1er mars 2018, un puissant flux d’air glacial venu de l’est, surnommé le “Moscou-Paris”, envahit une grande partie de l’Europe continentale. Il provoque en France une vague de froid courte mais intense, d’abord sèche, puis accompagnée de neige. Un premier épisode neigeux concerne l’extrême Sud-Est entre le 26 et le 27 février, lié à une instabilité débordant d’Italie. La neige tombe jusqu’en plaine et même sur le littoral entre le Var, les Alpes-Maritimes et l’est des Bouches-du-Rhône. Elle atteint Nice, Menton et surtout Ajaccio, qui se réveille le 27 février sous 15 cm de neige. La nuit des 27-28 février est glaciale sur l’ensemble du pays, avec des températures descendant sous –10°C sur près de la moitié de la France, y compris en Île-de-France, dans le Nord et le Centre. On relève notamment –14,3°C à Luxeuil-les-Bains, –13,4°C à Clermont-Ferrand et Nancy, –11°C à Creil, –10,3°C à Orléans et –10°C à Lyon-Bron. La vague de froid se termine entre le mercredi 28 février au matin et le jeudi 1er mars dans l’après-midi par un épisode neigeux plus généralisé, progressant du Sud-Ouest vers le Nord et le Nord-Ouest.

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Une dépression très creuse va apporter des vents forts et de nouvelles pluies abondantes sur la France en milieu de semaine Vents forts et nouvelles pluies intenses sont attendues au passage d'une dépression bien creuse sur la France entre mercredi 18 et jeudi 19 février 2026. Le niveau de certains cours d'eau étant déjà très élevé, cette nouvelle tempête laisse craindre le pire. Un temps restant agité dans les prochains jours L’influence océanique perturbée persiste en cette mi-février. Sous l’effet d’un courant jet survolant la France, de nouvelles perturbations sont attendues dans les prochains jours, avec plusieurs zones dépressionnaires circulant sur l’ouest de l’Europe jusqu’au week-end. La situation nécessitera une vigilance particulière entre mercredi et jeudi. Une dépression secondaire devrait se former rapidement en marge d’une zone dépressionnaire au large de l’Irlande, se dirigeant vers la Bretagne puis vers l’Italie jeudi. Cette dépression assez creuse devrait entraîner un temps très agité sur le pays, marqué par des vents forts et de fortes précipitations. Vents parfois forts, en limite du niveau de tempête Alors qu’un creusement dépressionnaire notable se dirige vers notre pays, les vents vont se renforcer sur une partie ouest et sud de la France entre mercredi et jeudi. Les vents les plus forts devraient suivre une trajectoire similaire à celle de la tempête Nils, mais heureusement, ils ne devraient pas atteindre la même intensité. C'est donc notamment entre la façade Atlantique, le sud-ouest et les abords de la Méditerranée que les rafales les plus fortes sont attendues entre mercredi soir et jeudi avec parfois plus de 90-100 voire 140 km/h sur les secteurs les plus exposés. Ceci restera néanmoins à confirmer d'ici là. Rafales maximales de vent prévues d'ici vendredi matin, selon le modèle météo européen - via Meteociel Des pluies abondantes et une aggravation des inondations Outre les vents parfois forts, il conviendra également de surveiller le risque de nouvelles fortes précipitations au passage de cette dépression sur notre pays. En effet, entre les pluies parfois abondantes de ce lundi, surtout sur le sud et l'est de la France et le passage de la dépression PEDRO, les cumuls de précipitations s'annoncent de nouveau très importants entre mardi midi et jeudi soir, y compris dans le bassin de la Seine et de la Loire. Cumuls de précipitations attendus entre mardi matin et jeudi soir – Modèle européen via Meteociel Or, ces précipitations toucheront des secteurs déjà particulièrement durement touchées ces dernières semaines, secteurs où les inondations sont déjà nombreuses et parfois importantes depuis la semaine dernière. C'est notamment le cas d'une large partie ouest de la France où la quasi-totalité des cours d'eau sont en crue et où la Garonne, la Loire Saumuroise et les basses vallées angevines subissent une crue historique. Carte Vigicrues du 18 février 2026 à 09h56 Les précipitations de ce début de semaine, suivies du passage de la dépression entre mercredi et jeudi, risquent d’aggraver considérablement la situation actuelle dans ce secteur, laissant craindre des crues généralisées et potentiellement importantes. Un coefficient de marée et une forte houle aggravant la situation Et comme si cela ne suffisait pas, ces intempéries surviennent au plus mauvais moment. Bien qu’il ne s’agisse pas de marées d’équinoxe, les coefficients restent particulièrement élevés (96 et 97), et la houle générée par cette dépression profonde pourrait dépasser les 6 mètres de hauteur sur la façade Atlantique jeudi matin. Cette situation risque de freiner l’écoulement des cours d’eau et, par conséquent, d’aggraver encore davantage les inondations.

### 6. `FR` [Chutes de neige mercredi au nord de la Seine](data/articles/4f54bfa657e8b886ea840d64c1ea3399.html)
**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Après l’épisode neigeux de dimanche (qui a finalement été moins important que prévu), la douceur est revenue rapidement. Cependant, de nouvelles chutes de neige pourraient se produire en limite de l’air froid mercredi matin. Un conflit avec l'air froid sur le nord de la France Dès mardi soir, de l’air froid en provenance de Scandinavie descendra vers l’Allemagne et la Belgique, et pourrait toucher toutes les régions situées au nord de la Seine. Dans cette zone, les températures seront négatives, tandis qu’au sud de la Loire, il fera facilement plus de 10°C. Les régions autour de la Seine seront donc au cœur d’un conflit avec des températures autour de 0 à 1°C et des précipitations causées par une dépression en Manche. Ces précipitations pourraient se transformer en neige, notamment en raison de l’isothermie engendrée par l’intensité et la persistance de ces dernières. Dans ce type de situation, tout est possible, car la formation de la neige dépend de la température et de l’intensité des précipitations. L'étendue et la localisation des chutes de neige régions dépendront également de la position de la dépression. Position des masses d'air à 850 hPa prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO européen pour mercredi matin - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Une zone de neige possible au niveau de la Seine ou au nord Depuis trois ou quatre jours, le modèle météo européen prévoit des chutes de neige au nord de la Seine, sur une bande d'environ 150 km de large. Ce secteur est souvent le théâtre de confrontations hivernales entre l’air froid scandinave et la douceur océanique, ce qui peut entraîner d’importantes chutes de neige. Les exemples ne manquent pas… Évolution des épaisseurs de neige prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO américain entre mercredi 00h et jeudi 7h - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Selon les cartes de prévision des épaisseurs de neige du modèle météo européen pour mercredi matin, il pourrait tomber entre 1 et 10 cm de neige dans cette zone. Cependant, cette carte pourrait exagérer les chutes de neige, comme ce fut le cas lors de l’épisode de dimanche matin. Ces prévisions dépendent évidemment du conflit, mais surtout des températures. Il est donc possible que seuls les plateaux situés à plus de 100 m d’altitude soient blanchis. Dans ce type de situation, les vallées connaissent généralement des températures trop élevées pour que la neige tienne réellement au sol. Épaisseurs de neige prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO européen pour mercredi matin - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Le modèle américain envisage de la neige un peu plus au nord Le modèle météo européen n’est pas le seul à prévoir de la neige ce mercredi matin. Le modèle américain, quant à lui, anticipe un conflit à peu près calé sur la même zone, mais avec des épaisseurs qui semblent plus réalistes. Soyons honnêtes, certains modèles ne prévoient aucune neige, car les températures seraient trop élevées pour sa formation. Dans ces situations « limites », les prévisions météo sont délicates, même à quelques heures d’échéance.

### 7. `FR` [Vers le retour du beau temps (et la fin des inondations) ??](data/articles/42c33b147843878761bcaee76543c20f.html)
**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Bientôt le retour d'un temps plus calme ? Depuis plusieurs semaines, la France subit l’influence d’un courant océanique humide et perturbé, engendrant des précipitations fréquentes, des vents parfois tempétueux et un temps durablement instable. Jusqu'à présent, il était devenu rare d’enchaîner plusieurs jours de temps anticyclonique sur la France. Les hautes pressions ne parvenaient jamais à s’installer durablement, et le courant océanique reprenait rapidement le dessus. Cependant, une amélioration semble se profiler. Bien que le temps reste perturbé dans les prochains jours, les prévisions météorologiques annoncent le retour de conditions anticycloniques pour la fin de semaine sur la France et une partie de l’ouest de l’Europe. En effet, le courant-jet devrait circuler plus au nord de l’Europe en fin de semaine, permettant aux hautes pressions (anticyclone des Açores) de s’étendre à nouveau vers l’ouest du continent, et donc vers la France pour le week-end. Cela devrait assurer le retour d’un temps plus sec et calme durant au moins 4 jours. Prévision de l'évolution des anticyclones et dépressions sur l'Europe du jeudi 16 au lundi 23 février 2026 – Modèle européen via Meteociel Un temps calme s'imposant enfin plus durablement ? Il est difficile de prédire avec certitude. Si les modélisations de ces derniers jours suggéraient une tendance anticyclonique plus durable sur notre pays, les dernières simulations remettent en question cette hypothèse. Le courant océanique pourrait reprendre de la vigueur dès mercredi 25 février à la fin du mois. Prévision de l'évolution des anticyclones et dépressions sur l'Europe du lundi 23 février au lundi 2 mars 2026 – Modèle européen Cependant, certains scénarios envisagent une inversion de la situation et l'arrêt de ce courant perturbé océanique au début du mois de mars avec la formation d'un vaste anticyclone entre les Açores et la partie nord de l'Europe. Ceci annoncerait potentiellement le début d'une nouvelle accalmie beaucoup plus prolongée sur la France, mais il faudra attendre que la dépression qui viendra peut-être s'isoler sur le sud du pays disparaisse. Les tendances pour le mois de mars indiquent même un temps durablement sec. Bien que nous restions prudents, une telle évolution serait un contraste saisissant avec les conditions météorologiques récentes et une excellente nouvelle pour la gestion des crues et inondations.

Crue majeure de la Loire à Béhuard (49) ce mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Jérémy Girault De nombreux cours d'eau débordent dans l'ouest de la France et certaines crues sont majeures. La situation ne va pas s'arranger car de nouvelles pluies copieuses sont prévues dans les prochaines heures. Notre article fait le point sur la situation. Crues majeures et nouvelles pluies à venir La situation reste particulièrement tendue d'un point de vue hydrométrique dans la moitié ouest de la France où de nombreux cours d'eau étaient encore en vigilance orange ce mardi 17 février 2026. Certains tronçons sont même en vigilance ROUGE : la Garonne marmandaise et girondine, la Loire saumuroise et les basses vallées angevines et, plus dernièrement, la Charente-aval. Ces tronçons de l'ouest de la France subissent actuellement des crues majeures et, pour certains, vont encore monter dans les prochaines heures. Carte de vigilance des cours d'eau émise le mardi 17 février 2026 à 16h - Vigicrues Pour ne rien arranger, la pluie n'en finit plus de tomber. Une nouvelle onde pluvieuse gagne le nord-ouest de la France en nuit du mardi 17 au mercredi 18 février 2026 et plusieurs passages pluvieux balayeront l'hexagone mercredi et jeudi. Sur les 48 prochaines heures, il faut s'attendre à plusieurs dizaines de millimètres supplémentaires sur tout le nord, le centre et l'ouest de la France, ainsi que dans les Alpes. Les cumuls vont atteindre 50 à 70 mm dans l'ouest et le sud de la Bretagne et sur le sud-ouest du Massif Central, sur des sols déjà saturés ! L'ampleur des crues va donc encore croître... Cumuls de pluie modélisés les mercredi 18 et jeudi 19 février 2026 - meteologix.com Plusieurs secteurs lourdement impactés Si la Garonne a atteint son pic dimanche et a depuis entamé une très lente décrue, le pire est encore à venir dans le Maine-et-Loire où plusieurs cours d'eau ont été placés en vigilance ROUGE. Ce niveau maximal d'alerte concerne la Mayenne, Loire, la Maine et la Sarthe dans les basses vallées angevines. Ce mardi 17 février 2026, la crue de la Maine causait des inondations notables sur la promenade de Reculée à Angers et le niveau va continuer de monter probablement jusqu'au milieu de la semaine. Crue importante du Maine à Angers (49) ce mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Jean Ruaud En après-midi de mardi, les services de Vigicrues ont déclenché la vigilance ROUGE en Charente-Maritime. Le pire est à venir car les niveaux sont encore en train de monter plus en amont. À Cognac dans le département voisin de la Charente, le fleuve atteignait 7,75 mètres en fin d'après-midi du mardi 17 février 2026, 16 cm au dessus de la crue de décembre 2023. En Charente-Maritime, les inondations les plus importantes sont prévues en milieu de semaine avec plusieurs dizaines de centimètres supplémentaires prévus à Saintes, où la crue de 2023 est déjà dépassée.

Après plusieurs journées aux allures de printemps, marquées par une douceur exceptionnelle — jusqu’à 18 °C à Paris le 18 février 1958 — la situation bascule brutalement. Une masse d’air polaire déferle par le nord et le thermomètre s’effondre de 12 °C en seulement quelques heures. Tout le Nord-Pas-de-Calais paralysé après une nuit de cauchemar Dans la nuit du 25 au 26 février 1958, une violente tempête de neige frappe toute la moitié nord de la France, et particulièrement le Nord-Pas-de-Calais. En quelques heures, 10 à 15 cm de neige tombent, balayés par des rafales proches de 120 km/h. D’immenses congères se forment, bloquant routes et autoroutes. Des centaines d’automobilistes se retrouvent piégés dans leur véhicule, incapables d’avancer ou de faire demi-tour. En pleine nuit, des milliers de voitures sont abandonnées en rase campagne. Le bilan est dramatique : quatre personnes perdent la vie. Robert Lamoureux, Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle pris dans la tempête de neige Parmi les conducteurs pris au piège figure le fantaisiste Robert Lamoureux. En route de Bruxelles vers Paris au volant de sa voiture américaine, il se heurte à un véritable mur de neige près de Baisieux. Alors qu’il tente de se dégager, son véhicule s’embrase. Il réussit à s’extraire à temps, échappant de justesse à la catastrophe. Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle vivent eux aussi une nuit éprouvante. Après s’être rendus à Lille pour présenter le film « Ascenseur pour l’échafaud », dont elle est la vedette et lui le réalisateur, ils prennent la direction de Thumeries, au sud de Lille, où réside la famille de Louis Malle. Leur voiture est immobilisée par la neige près de Seclin. Ils ne seront secourus que le lendemain matin, vers 8 heures, par un camionneur, transis de froid. La DS ensevelie par la neige et dans laquelle Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle ont été pris au piège durant une nuit, transis de froid - archives meteo-paris.com Cet épisode marque également un tournant médiatique. À la suite de cette tempête, Paul Douchy, prévisionniste à la Météorologie nationale, commence à présenter la météo quotidiennement à la télévision. Jusqu’alors, depuis le 17 décembre 1946, ce rendez-vous n’était proposé qu’une fois par semaine. Une évolution emblématique d’une télévision française en plein essor, désormais présente dans près d’un million de foyers. Une neige abondante également entre Paris et les régions de l'Est Paris n’est pas épargnée : près de 10 cm de neige recouvrent la capitale, sous des rafales dépassant 115 km/h. Les fortes chutes concernent également l’est du pays — notamment l’Ain, le Doubs et le Jura — où l’épaisseur du manteau neigeux atteint localement 50 à 60 cm. 20 jours plus tôt (le 7 février 1958) l'Alsace connaissant également une tempête de neige particulièrement marquée - archives meteo-paris.com A lire également : &gt;&gt;&gt; Chronique météo de l'année 1958 &gt;&gt;&gt; Notre almanach météo &gt;&gt;&gt; Compte X @Meteovilles Auteur : Guillaume Séchet

La pluie n'en finit plus de tomber sur la France, causant des crues majeures dans la moitié ouest. expliquer qu'il pleut autant depuis le début de l'année et cette situation est-elle exceptionnelle ? Notre article vous explique. Une circulation atmosphérique atypique Depuis le début de l'année 2026, le courant jet circule à des latitudes plus basses qu'en temps normal. Il a longuement ondulé de la côte est des États-Unis vers les Açores avant de passer par la péninsule ibérique et la Méditerranée. Ainsi, il a permis aux dépressions de s'enchaîner sur la péninsule ibérique et la Méditerranée avec des pluies affectant une grande partie de la France. En remontant quelque peu, ce jet passe désormais au dessus de la France et maintient l'agitation. De plus, ajoutons que les vagues de froid nord-américaines ont dynamisé l'activité dépressionnaire sur l'Atlantique. En arrivant au dessus de l'océan, l'air polaire favorise le creusement des dépressions, qui traversent ensuite l'Atlantique vers l'Europe. Schéma montrant la circulation basse en latitude du courant jet fin janvier et début février 2026 - Météo Villes Ainsi, cela fait maintenant plusieurs semaines que l'activité dépressionnaire est particulièrement marquée sur notre pays et globalement sur tout l'ouest de l'Europe. Sur la période du 1er janvier au 15 février 2026, l'anomalie de pression atteint -19 hPa par rapport à la normale au large de la Bretagne ! Un tel déficit sur une période de 45 jours est spectaculaire et témoigne de l'activité dépressionnaire hors norme qu'a subi la France. Si vous consultez régulièrement votre baromètre, vous avez surement remarqué que la pression est souvent très basse depuis le début de l'année 2026. Anomalie de pression du 1er janvier au 15 février 2026 - keraunos.org Des cumuls de pluie vraiment remarquables Sur les 45 premiers jours de l'année, 39 ont enregistré au moins 1 mm de pluie en moyenne nationale ! Cela signifie que 87% des jours ont été pluvieux en France depuis le début 2026, un chiffre remarquable ! Non seulement la pluie a été anormalement fréquente mais elle est aussi anormalement abondante. La Bretagne symbolise cet excès de pluie avec des cumuls tout bonnement remarquables. Au 18 février, il est déjà tombé 566 mm de pluie à Quimper depuis le début de l'année ! Cela représente 260% du cumul normal, c'est à dire qu'il est tombé 2,6 fois plus de pluie que lors d'un début d'année moyen ! Jamais de telles pluies n'avaient été observées depuis le début des mesures. Sur le graphique ci-dessous, on note l'absence d'accalmie avec des courbes qui croissent presque continuellement. Cumuls de pluie sur plusieurs villes bretonnes depuis le début de l'année 2026 - Le Parisien Autre indicateur qui permet de montrer que ce début d'année 2026 est véritablement exceptionnel : l'indice d'humidité des sols atteint des records. En effet, en date du 17 février 2026, l'indice moyenné à échelle nationale est à son plus haut niveau depuis le début des mesures pour cette époque de l'année. D'ailleurs, il arrive même sur le podium des situations où les sols ont été les plus humides en France, toutes dates confondues. Seuls décembre 1982 et janvier 1994, théâtres de graves inondations, avaient connu une humidité moyenne légèrement supérieure à la situation actuelle. Indice d'humidité des sols en moyenne nationale du 18 février 2025 au 17 février 2026 - Météo France En résumé : la situation actuelle est véritablement remarquable avec des crues spectaculaires générées par des pluies parfois records, elles-mêmes liées à une séquence remarquablement dépressionnaire, tant par son intensité que sa durée.

Graves inondations dans le sud-ouest durant le mois de mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Le mois de mars 1930 est resté gravé dans les annales pour sa pluviométrie exceptionnelle dans le sud-ouest de la France, où des inondations d'ampleur historique avaient coûté la vie à plusieurs centaines de personnes ! Des crues d'ampleur dramatique Si les crues observées en ce mois de février 2026 sont majeures, celles survenues il y a un peu moins d'un siècle étaient encore plus spectaculaires. En effet, la fin de l'année 1929 se déroule sous un courant océanique persistant avec de nombreuses précipitations et cette tendance se poursuit au début de l'année 1930. Ainsi, les crues se multiplient sur le pays et atteignent leur apogée au mois de mars 1930, notamment dans les régions du sud-ouest. Les cours d'eau atteignent des niveaux records et les vastes plaines sont recouvertes par l'eau à perte de vue ! Ampleur remarquable des inondations dans le sud-ouest en mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Parmi les crues les plus remarquables, celle du Tarn marque véritablement les esprits. Du 1er au 4 mars 1930, le Tarn et ses affluents atteignent des niveaux et des débits historiques, se transformant en de véritables torrents ! Les communes traversées par ces cours d'eau subissent des crues d'ampleur exceptionnelle et la puissance du courant provoquer l'effondrement de nombreux bâtiments. Le village de Reyniès, sur la photo ci-dessous, est littéralement ravagé par la crue du Tarn ! Le village de Reyniès (82) ravagé par la crue du Tarn en mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Lourds dégâts et plus de 300 victimes ! Lorsque vient la décrue, on découvre des villes et villages ravagés par la puissance de cours d'eau devenus des torrents en furie. Dans le Tarn, la commune de Moissac a subi de lourds dégâts. De nombreux bâtiments qui bordaient le cours d'eau se sont effondrés. En plus des dégâts matériels considérables, le bilan humain est très lourd. Les crues ont emporté des dizaines de personnes, dont certaines ne seront jamais retrouvées.

Quantités de neige remarquables à La Rosière en Savoie (73) le mercredi 18 février 2026 - photo Météo Tarentaise Les stations des Alpes croulent sous plusieurs mètres de neige, perturbant la vie quotidienne. D'importantes avalanches se déclenchent, coupant parfois les routes d'accès aux stations. Sur place, les images sont impressionnantes ! Parfois 3 mètres dans les stations ! Les quantités de neige sont actuellement remarquables dans la plupart des massifs alpins, notamment entre les Hautes-Alpes, l'Isère, la Savoie et la Haute-Savoie. De nombreuses stations mesurent des quantités inédites depuis de nombreuses années, du fait de la succession d'épisodes perturbés depuis plusieurs semaines. La couche au sol atteint fréquemment entre 2 et 3 mètres vers 2000 mètres dans les stations, comme l'illustre le cliché ci-dessous pris à La Rosière en Savoie. La station de La Rosière ensevelie sous plusieurs mètres de neige le mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Météo Tarentaise Dans les stations, la vie est perturbée par ces quantités de neige remarquables. Se déplacer devient difficile voire impossible. Ceux qui n'ont pas bougé depuis plusieurs jours voient leurs véhicules parfois totalement ensevelis sous plusieurs mètres de neige ! Dans les rues, on se déplace dans de véritables tranchées creusées dans la neige et les toitures croulent sous un manteau neigeux particulièrement impressionnant, comme ici dans la station de Bessans.

Cette station météo, perchée à près de deux mètres, est quasiment atteinte. Les relevés humains ont signalé une couche de 2,70 mètres à Chamrousse à 2000 mètres d'altitude ce mercredi 18 février 2026 !

Encore un peu de patience : cette longue séquence agitée et pluvieuse avec des inondations touche probablement à sa fin. Après une période transitoire d'environ une à deux semaines, il semble que le mois de mars sera beaucoup plus sec. Vers le retour d’un temps plus calme ? Depuis plusieurs semaines, la France est soumise à un flux océanique humide et perturbé. Résultat : des pluies fréquentes, des épisodes venteux parfois soutenus et une instabilité persistante. Les périodes anticycloniques durables se sont faites rares, les hautes pressions peinant à s’installer avant d’être rapidement balayées par le retour des perturbations atlantiques. Une évolution plus favorable semble toutefois se dessiner à moyen et long terme. A partir de ce week-end, les modèles météo envisagent le retour de conditions anticycloniques sur la moitié Sud de la France et le courant-jet remontera vers le nord du continent. Cette configuration apportera un temps plus sec et plus calme pendant au moins quatre jours, et surtout sur les régions de l'Ouest et du Sud-ouest, durement éprouvées par les inondations. Le grand retour de l'anticyclone des Açores sur le sud-ouest de l'Europe ce week-end ! Carte de prévisions ECMWF pour samedi 21 février 2026 Une accalmie durable en perspective ? La prudence reste néanmoins de mise. Si les simulations précédentes suggéraient une installation prolongée des hautes pressions, les dernières tendances sont plus nuancées. Le flux océanique pourrait se remettre en place dès le mercredi 25 février jusqu'en fin de mois. Certains scénarios envisagent cependant un changement plus marqué au début du mois de mars, avec l’établissement d’un vaste anticyclone entre les Açores et le nord de l’Europe. Une telle configuration pourrait bloquer durablement les perturbations atlantiques et favoriser une période sèche prolongée sur la France. Il resterait toutefois à surveiller l’éventuelle formation d’une dépression isolée sur le sud du pays, susceptible de retarder cette stabilisation. Les tendances mensuelles pour mars vont même dans le sens d’un temps globalement plus sec. Si cette évolution se confirmait, elle trancherait nettement avec les conditions agitées récentes et constituerait une bonne nouvelle pour la gestion des crues et des inondations. Néanmoins, à cette échéance, les projections restent susceptibles d’évoluer. Il conviendra donc de suivre attentivement les prochaines mises à jour des modèles météorologiques.

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Les anomalies de température prévue pour mercredi prochain seront très importantes : localement jusqu'à 12°C au-dessus des normales de saison ! Après de longues semaines marquées par une météo très agitée, entre pluies abondantes, vents violents et inondations, la situation commence enfin à s’améliorer. Même si l’hiver n’est pas encore terminé, la fin du mois de février annonce souvent les premiers signes du printemps — et c’est bien ce qui semble se profiler cette année. Retour de l'anticyclone des Açores Depuis plusieurs semaines, l’anticyclone des Açores nous délaisse. Positionné bien trop au sud, il laisse le courant perturbé océanique influencer l’ensemble de l’Europe, y compris la péninsule Ibérique. Dans ce contexte, la France connaît un temps particulièrement instable, ce qui explique des inondations de plus en plus étendues et marquées. La situation s’apprête toutefois à évoluer. Dès ce week-end, les hautes pressions devraient progressivement remonter vers l’Europe continentale. L’anticyclone se centrera alors sur l’Andalousie. Le flux d’ouest océanique restera présent sur la France, mais il sera nettement moins actif : les pluies se cantonneront principalement aux côtes de la Manche. Évolution de la masse d'air prévue entre mardi et mercredi - animation WRF Meteociel Parenthèse printanière d'une à deux journées À partir de lundi, et surtout mardi, les hautes pressions se décaleront davantage vers le continent. Le vent s’orientera au sud, favorisant la remontée d’un air très doux en provenance du Maroc. En cette fin février, le soleil gagne déjà en hauteur dans le ciel. Dans une telle configuration, les températures peuvent grimper plus facilement qu’au cœur de l’hiver. La période de la Saint-Valentin marque d’ailleurs souvent le début du réveil de la nature : certains oiseaux entament leur période de reproduction, ce qui serait à l’origine de cette fête. La fin du mois de février offre régulièrement une ou deux journées aux accents printaniers. Les journée de mardi et surtout mercredi devraient illustrer parfaitement cette tendance : le ciel sera enfin dégagé sur les trois quarts du pays et les températures dépasseront fréquemment les 15 °C l’après-midi. Avec un vent de sud soufflant au pied des Pyrénées, le seuil de chaleur pourrait même être approché, voire atteint localement, avec jusqu’à 25 °C sur le Pays basque. Prévisions des températures METEO-VILLES pour mercredi prochain Cette parenthèse printanière pourrait être d'assez courte durée. Dès jeudi, le courant perturbé océanique devrait reprendre le dessus, entraînant le retour des nuages, de quelques pluies par l’ouest et, mécaniquement, des températures un peu moins agréables, même si la douceur restera d’actualité.

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Vague de froid du mois de février 1917 à Paris : Même les chevaux ne résistent pas ! archives meteo-paris.com Les deux derniers hivers de la Première Guerre mondiale sont particulièrement rudes en France, déjà en partie dévastée par trois années de combats. Entre le 20 janvier et le 15 février 1917, une vague de froid exceptionnelle frappe surtout le Nord et l’Est du pays, atteignant son apogée au début de février avec des températures extrêmement glaciales. Dans « Le Monde Illustré » du 3 février 1917, on note que cet hiver renoue avec la tradition, car selon le journal « les grands hivers d’antan deviennent de plus en plus rares… ». Il est vrai que la courbe de l’évolution des températures hivernales en France indique un réchauffement du début du siècle à l’arrivée de la Première Guerre mondiale. Des conditions météo insoutenables pour le moral des troupes Les sols gelés de l’Aisne, paradoxalement, permettent des mouvements de troupes impossibles sur sols boueux en temps normal. Cependant, l’armée française souffre terriblement du froid, étant nettement sous-équipée pour y résister, contrairement à l’armée allemande. Les régiments ne disposent que de quelques peaux de bête, et certains tirailleurs algériens sont même chaussés de souliers découverts et vêtus de culottes courtes. Ces conditions difficiles affectent grandement le moral des troupes. La relève sous la neige durant la guerre - début 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Jusqu’à -26°C dans les plaines et vallées de l'Est de la France ! Le froid atteint son point culminant au tout début du mois de février avec des températures glaciales : -26 °C à Bonneville, -23 °C à Commercy, -22 °C à Montbrison, -20 °C à Grenoble, -18 °C à Lyon, -17 °C à Alençon et Clermont-Ferrand, et -15,5 °C à Paris. Les dix premiers jours de février sont comparés à la situation de février 1895. A Paris, le déneigement des voies de circulation est très compliqué en raison du manque de main-d’œuvre. Les femmes sont alors réquisitionnées. Février 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Les rivières gèlent peu à peu Les rivières de l’Est commencent à geler le 24 janvier, tandis que celles du Nord, y compris celles de la région parisienne, le sont dans les derniers jours de janvier, un phénomène inédit depuis 1895. La navigation devient impossible sur les canaux puis sur la Seine. Parallèlement, la forte demande en charbon engendre d’importantes difficultés d’approvisionnement à Paris, comme à Londres. Malgré l’utilisation de quelques brise-glace et la construction de barrages pour retenir les glaces près de Rouen, les péniches restent bloquées entre Rouen et Paris. Un service spécial de transports automobiles est alors mis en place. Rouen - 7 février 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Le prix du charbon s'envole !! Les files d’attente pour acheter du charbon s’allongent, et les prix s’envolent. Même les bourgeoises des beaux quartiers doivent attendre des heures, ce qui ne manque pas de provoquer quelques grincements de dents, tant figurés que réels. La pénurie de charbon, alors que de nombreuses machines en dépendaient à l’époque, a de plus en plus d’impact sur l’activité économique. Des lignes de tramway sont interrompues, des usines ferment leurs portes, et les blanchisseries, chauffées au coke, cessent progressivement leurs activités. Certains journaux s’indignent même que les prisonniers allemands soient mieux chauffés que les Français.

Alors que la douceur va s'affirmer dans les prochains jours, on se demande si l'hiver est terminé en France. Toutefois, le passé lointain comme récent nous ont montré que l'hiver peut encore se manifester bien au delà du mois de février. Congères de 2 mètres à Gonneville dans le Cotentin (50) le 13 mars 2013 - via infoclimat.fr D'importantes coulées froides peuvent encore survenir Lorsque les jours rallongent et que le pôle Nord se réchauffe, le vortex polaire - qui concentre la majorité de l'air froid aux hautes latitudes - devient moins stable. C'est à dire qu'il devient de moins en moins compact. Il peut alors se déformer et entraîne avec lui des ondulations plus importantes du courant jet. Ainsi, des coulées d'air froid peuvent d'échapper du pôle en direction des latitudes moyennes comme la France. Il est donc tout à fait classique d'observer des coups de froid tardifs sur nos régions en mars, ce pourquoi il ne faut jamais enterrer l'hiver trop vite. Schéma d'un vortex polaire instable et d'un courant jet ondulant (classique au printemps) - NOAA Il suffit de regarder les relevés du passé pour se rendre compte qu'un froid marqué peut encore survenir au cours du mois de mars. À Paris-Montsouris, on peut encore descendre sous les -5°C durant la première partie du mois. L'exemple le plus récent date du 13 mars 2013 avec une température qui affichait -5,5°C à l'aube. De plus, on peut encore assister à des journées sans dégel jusqu'à début mars. D'ailleurs, le jour sans dégel le plus tardif est assez récent puisqu'il s'agissait également du 13 mars 2023 où le thermomètre n'avait pas dépassé -1,4°C dans la capitale ! Températures minimales et maximales les plus basses mesurées à Paris-Montsouris en mars depuis 1886 - infoclimat.fr Offensives hivernales en mars : des exemples récents Il est donc important de rappeler qu'il est beaucoup trop tôt pour enterrer l'hiver. Si l'hiver météorologique s'achève au 28 février, le froid et la neige en plaine peuvent encore se manifester bien après ! Rappelons qu'il peut encore neiger sur toute la France au cours du mois de mars. Il n'y a d'ailleurs pas besoin d'aller fouiller dans les archives lointaines pour retrouver des épisodes hivernaux marquants en mars. En 2010, l'agglomération de Perpignan s'était retrouvée sous 25 à 40 cm de neige le 8 mars et les températures plongeaient localement jusqu'à -10°C dans le nord-est de l'hexagone ! 30 à 40 cm de neige sur l'agglomération de Perpignan (66) le lundi 8 mars 2010 - Météo Villes Encore plus près de nous, on peut évoquer la tempête de neige historique qui s'était produite de la Bretagne à la Belgique le 12 mars 2013. La Normandie avait été la région la plus touchée et Météo France avait même déclenché la vigilance ROUGE neige dans la Manche et le Calvados. Le vent violent avait causé des congères atteignant 1 à 2 mètres de haut ! Par endroits, les véhicules étaient littéralement ensevelis ! Hors-congères, il était tombé 20 à 40 cm de façon généralisé dans ces départements. Le village des Pieux dans le Cotentin (50), dans la tempête de neige du 13 mars 2013 - via infoclimat.fr S'il n'y a pour le moment pas de réel signal vers un retour du froid, ce dernier ne peut aucunement être exclu alors que nous ne sommes qu'en février.

Le château de Versailles sous la neige dans une ambiance polaire le 15 février 2010 – Archives Météo-Villes Un mois de janvier exceptionnellement neigeux ! Après un automne 2009 plutôt doux, l'hiver a fait un retour remarqué dès le mois de décembre sur la France. Une première vague de froid s'est en effet propagée jusqu'à la France à partir du 13 décembre avec de l’air glacial venu de Russie envahissant tout le pays et de la neige sur de nombreuses régions, atteignant même la région de Nice le 18 décembre. Cette première vague de froid se termine quasiment le jour de Noël, mais la douceur qui caractérise les derniers jours de l’année ne sera que très éphémère. Après une courte pause plus douce donc, le froid revient de plus belle à partir du 31 décembre 2009. Le début du mois de janvier 2010 est ainsi très hivernal sur la quasi totalité de la France avec de première chutes de neige le 1er janvier entre les côtes de la Manche et l'Île-de-France (10cm en Seine-Maritime). Les 3 et 4 janvier, c'est sur le sud de la France que la neige se montre plus étendue, tombant du Poitou à la région Rhône-Alpes en passant par le Limousin et l'Auvergne, on mesure 20cm à Grenoble, 13cm à Lyon et 8cm à Clermont-Ferrand. 8 cm à Lyon le 4 janvier 2010 – Archives Météo-Villes Le 6 janvier, la neige tombe par averses en Normandie avec 20cm mesurés à Honfleur. Le lendemain, on mesure 30cm à Alençon, 20cm à Dreux, Chartres et entre le sud du 78, 91 et 77 au passage d'une goutte froide alors qu'il neige également sur le sud-est entre le Languedoc-Roussillon et la Camargue puis jusqu'en vallée du Rhône et dans les Alpes la nuit suivante. Alors que la matinée du 8 janvier est glaciale dans le nord du pays avec jusqu'à -20,6°C 0 Brétigny-sur-Orge, battant le record de 1985, de très fortes chutes de neige persistent sur le sud. On mesure jusqu'à 50cm à Gap, 35cm à Grenoble, 30cm à Orange et même 20cm en Camargue. Ces chutes persistent le lendemain avec des cumuls devenant impressionnants dans l'intérieur du Languedoc-Roussillon jusqu'au Tarn. Certains villages d'altitude sont coupés du monde avec parfois plus de 50 à 60cm cumulés ! 60cm de neige le 9 janvier 2010 aux Martys (900m) dans le département de l'Aude – Photographie : meteo81 La neige remonte d'ailleurs de nouveau sur le nord du pays durant cette journée, apportant 2 à 10cm supplémentaires jusqu'en Alsace, Bourgogne, Franche Comté et même en Bretagne. De très nombreuses région françaises sont ainsi sous la neige. Après une nouvelle perturbation accompagnée de neige (3 à 7cm sur une large partie du nord et de l'est du pays) et de pluie verglaçantes entre les Pays de la Loire, la Bretagne et la Basse-Normandie, le temps se montrera plus sec jusqu'au 20 janvier avec un redoux très progressif sur la majorité du pays. Celui-ci restera néanmoins une nouvelle-fois de courte durée. Une troisième vague de froid envahira en effet la France à partir du 25 janvier 2010. Le 28 janvier, de nouvelles averses de neige ont déjà lieu sur un large quart nord-est jusqu'au nord des Alpes avnat une perturbatioj plus active le lendemain, apportant des chutes plus franches en Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine, Bourgogne, Franche-Comté et au sud de l’Alsace. La neige tient surtout au-dessus de 300m d’altitude. Le 31 janvier, la neige atteint de nouveau la Côte d'Azur avec plusieurs centimètres entre Nice et Fréjus, surtout entre Cannes et Saint-Raphaël où les plages sont bien blanchies. Dans le même temps, on mesure -14°C à Aurillac et -11°C à Nevers. Plages blanchies par la neige à Cannes le 31 janvier 2010 au matin – Archives Météo-Villes Un mois de février tout aussi hivernal ! Le mois de février débute donc sous le froid et la neige sur de nombreuses régions. Dès le 1er févier, des chutes de neige sont observées sur une partie du nord et de l'est avec par exemple 5/7cm à Lyon. Le 2 février, on mesure 30cm de neige dès 200m d'altitude dans le nord-est avant un net redoux entre le 3 et le 4 sur la totalité du pays. À La Mure, on passe par exemple de -16,9°C en début de nuit à 10.7°C durant la journée ! Encore une fois, le redoux restera temporaire puisque la 4ème vague de froid de la saison envahira la France le 9 février avec notamment le retour de la neige sur le nord dès la fin de journée. Le 10 février, on observe des averses de neige sur une large partie du nord et du centre du pays, plus fréquentes sur le Pas-de-Calais. C'est néanmoins le 11 février que la neige va se montrer plus généralisée et même parfois forte une nouvelle-fois sur la Côte d'Azur. On mesure en effet 5cm à Nice en fin de journée du 11 février, 10 à 15cm à Cannes et jusqu'à 30-40cm dans la région de Grasse dès 200m d'altitude ! Les jours suivants seront plus secs mais généralement glaciales sur la quasi-totalité du pays, excepté entre la pointe Bretonne, la Côte d'Azur et le littoral de la Corse avec des gelées généralisées et parfois fortes, les minimales descendant souvent sous les -10/-15°C. Les chutes de neige successives et le froid deviennent pesants pour bon nombre de français - Une du 10 février 2010 Cette 4ème vague de froid prendra fin le 17 février avec la reprise d'un flux océanique très perturbé mais aussi plus doux. Plusieurs tempêtes successives concerneront d'ailleurs la France à la fin du mois de février, notamment la fameuse tempête Xynthia le 27 février au soir. L'hiver n'avait néanmoins pas dit son dernier mot, celui-ci faisant un dernier retour durant le mois de mars. Ce début d'année 2010 fut donc exceptionnellement neigeux sur notre pays, le plus neigeux depuis l'hiver 1986-1987, si bien que peu de régions ont été épargnées par les flocons entre décembre, janvier et février.

### 18. `FR` [Vers le début d’une lente décrue](data/articles/a0ab6818820313c7eac6d402bf88039a.html)
**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
La décrue est en vue sur la France avec le retour de conditions bien plus sèches - Celle-ci s'annonce néanmoins lente dans certains secteurs. Images impressionnantes de la crue de la Charente à Saintes ce mercredi 18 février 2026, dont le niveau va continuer de grimper cette nuit et demain. (photos via EPTB Charente) La décrue s'amorce en cette fin de semaine Le temps se montre exceptionnellement perturbé et humide en France depuis maintenant plusieurs semaines. En conséquences, les crues sont nombreuses et parfois très importantes à travers le pays, notamment sur l'ouest et le sud-ouest de la France. Plusieurs tronçons sont d'ailleurs toujours placés en vigilance rouge par Vigicrues ce vendredi 20 février : - Les basses vallées angevines - La Loire aval - La Loire saumuroise - La Charente aval Sur ces secteurs, les niveaux des cours d'eau continuent d'augmenter en cette fin de semaine avant un pic de crue attendu ce week-end. À Saintes par exemple, la Charente devrait atteindre un pic dimanche 22 février autour de 6.60 m (record de 6.84 m en décembre 1982). Évolution du niveau de la Charente à Saintes du 8 au 22 février 2026 – Vigicrues Ce pic devrait être suivi d'une lente décrue sur ce secteur, comme sur la majorité des cours d'eau de l'ouest de la France. En effet, une poussée anticyclonique est observée dès ce vendredi sur la France, ce qui permettra le retour d'un temps plus calme et sec au moins jusqu'en milieu voire fin de semaine prochaine. Cumuls de précipitations attendus jusqu'au vendredi 27 février 2026 sur la France – Modèle GFS via meteociel Ce retour au sec devrait donc permettre aux niveaux des cours d'eau d'entamer une baisse plus ou moins marquée dès ce week-end et ce durant plusieurs jours, une bonne nouvelle pour les régions sinistrées. Une décrue qui s'annonce lente dans certains secteurs Toutefois, il ne faut pas s'attendre à un retour à la normal dès la semaine prochaine. La décrue s'annonce en effet lente à très lente sur la majorité des cours d'eau français. Il faut en effet attendre que toute l'eau des bassins versants s'évacue avant que les fleuves et rivières retrouvent des niveaux plus normaux, ce qui s'annonce long sachant que les sols sont complètement saturés d'eau sur la quasi-totalité du pays. Il est donc logique d'observer un temps de retard entre l'arrêt des pluies et le début de la décrue, le temps que la pluie tombée en amont des cours d'eau se propage en aval. Schéma d'explication d'un bassin versant – METEO-EXTREME À cela s'ajoute la fonte plus ou moins marquée du manteau neigeux attendue dans les prochains jours sur les reliefs. Cette période plus calme et sèche devrait en effet s'accompagner d'un regain de douceur printanière sur notre pays, que ce soit en basses couches mais également en montagne. Cette douceur devrait engendrer un début de fonte du manteau neigeux parfois exceptionnel présent sur nos reliefs. On relevait en effet souvent plus de 250 à 350 cm de neige en haute montagne du côté des Alpes ce 20 février, parfois 4 mètres du côté de l'Isère. Les Pyrénées sont également très enneigées avec en général 250 à 280 cm sur les sommets de la région. Ainsi, l'eau de fonte devrait donc de nouveau alimenter les cours d'eau et ainsi maintenir des niveaux assez hauts malgré l'arrêt des précipitations. La couche de neige dépasse les 250cm en haute montagne dans les Pyrénées en cette fin de semaine comme ici au col du Portalet - Via Twitter @CyNPirineos Enfin, il est important de noter que certains scénarios envisagent déjà le retour de l'influence océanique perturbée pour la fin de semaine prochaine avec des pluies de nouveau généralisées et des perturbations successives, ce qui pourrait engendrer une nouvelle hausse du niveau des cours d'eau. Cette tendance reste néanmoins incertaine et sera à confirmer dans les prochains jours.

Neige à Paris - Place de l'Opéra - fin février 1948 - archives meteo-paris.com Une descente froide polaire particulièrement puissante À la fin de janvier et au début de février 1948, une puissante cellule anticyclonique s’installe sur la Scandinavie et l’Europe du Nord. Cette configuration bloque les perturbations atlantiques et favorise un flux persistant d’air continental très froid en provenance d’Europe orientale et de Russie. Les masses d’air, sèches et glaciales, s’étendent vers l’ouest et le sud-ouest du continent. L'air glacial qui descend de la mer baltique vers la France, le 20 février 1948 - Source : Wetterzentrale Une vague de froid intense à la fin du mois de février Du 20 au 27 février 1948 : le froid et la neige envahissent toute la France - la Bretagne est particulièrement concernée par cette offensive hivernale et la température descend à -13° à Brest où la ville est recouverte d’un épais manteau blanc. Les 22 et 23 février 1948 , une tempête de neige d’une rare violence paralyse la moitié nord. La température descend à -20°C à Clermont-Ferrand et -10 à -12°C en Ile-de-France. La neige atteint même la Côte d’Azur.

Les transports ferroviaires et routiers sont fortement perturbés par la neige et le gel. L’approvisionnement en énergie devient difficile dans plusieurs régions, entraînant des coupures de chauffage. Sur le plan humain, le froid intense provoque une surmortalité, en particulier parmi les populations les plus vulnérables. L’agriculture subit également des dégâts notables, avec des cultures et des arbres fruitiers affectés par le gel prolongé. Une circulation difficile sur la place de la Concorde à la fin du mois de février 1948 - archives meteo-paris.com La vague de froid de février 1948 est souvent associée, dans les archives météorologiques, au « grand hiver 1947-1948 ».

Certaines plages de la façade Atlantique sont bondées comme en plein été à la fin du mois de février 1990 - Archives Météo-Villes Un changement radical de temps Après trois semaines particulièrement agitées avec une succession de perturbations apportant notamment d'importantes quantités de neige en montagne, des pluies abondantes sur de nombreuses régions et même une puissante tempête sur le nord-ouest de la France, la situation change radicalement sur la France pour la dernière décade de février 1990. Une poussée anticyclonique se met en effet en place sur le pays à partir du 20 février, apportant le retour d'un temps calme et sec mais également un net regain de douceur avec la bascule du flux au sud/sud-ouest en altitude. Situation atmosphérique du 22 février 1990 sur l'Europe – Wetterzentrale Si les semaines précédentes s'était déjà montrées assez douces sous l'influence du flux océanique perturbé, les températures ont pris une toute autre mesure au début de la dernière décade de février 1990. De la chaleur en février ! À partir du 20 février donc, les températures s'envolent sur la totalité du pays. Une véritable vague de chaleur hivernale se met en effet en place sur la France sous ce puissant flux de sud/sud-ouest en altitude. Dès le 20 février, on atteint 20°C jusque dans les Hauts-de-France, 18,5°C à Paris et 19°C à Strasbourg, mais c'est notamment les journées des 23 et 24 février qui se montrent exceptionnellement douces sur la totalité du pays et même chaudes sur certaines régions. Le 23 février, le seuil de chaleur est régulièrement dépassé sur le sud-ouest de la France avec par exemple 25,7°C à Biarritz, 25,9 à Mont-de-Marsan et même 27,2°C à Dax ! Le 24 février, les 26/27°C sont dépassés sur le sud de l'Aquitaine avec jusqu'à 28°C à Peyrehorade (40) et même 28,1°C à Agnos (64). On relève également jusqu'à 25°C à Bordeaux, 23,5°C à Clermont-Ferrand, 22,6°C à Bourges, 22°C à Mulhouse, 21°C à Orléans et 20°C à Paris. Certaines stations du centre de la France atteignent également le seuil de chaleur. De très nombreux records sont observés. Températures maximales relevées sur la France le 24 février 1990 – archive Météo-Villes Cette vague de douceur/chaleur exceptionnelle pour la période prendra fin sur la majorité du pays dès le lendemain avec le retour d'air océanique moins doux. Seules les régions allant du Massif Central au nord-est conserveront des températures très douces avec 22,3°C à Saint-Étienne, 21,8°C à Colmar, 19,9°C à Vichy. Deux tempêtes toucheront ensuite la France entre le 26 et le 28 février. Le mois de février 1990 s'est montré dans l'ensemble exceptionnellement doux. La température moyenne nationale durant ce mois a en effet dépassé la normale 1981/2010 de + 4°C, ce qui n'a jamais été égalé jusqu'à aujourd'hui.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware) RFID cards and tags are everywhere! We use them in buildings for access control. Printers and photocopiers can use them to identify staff members. Livestock tagging and pet identification tags all use a form of RFID. The tech to read an RFID device is cheap, for around $5 you can get the reader, and for $4, a Raspberry Pi Pico can read the IDs from the cards / tags.In this how to, we will learn how to read RFID tags and cards using an MFRC522 reader and a Raspberry Pi Pico, the goal will be to create a fictional RFID access control system that will allow users into a building, or alert security to remove them. Before we can do that, we need to identify the ID of our cards / tags. The first section of this how to will do just that, and then we will insert some code to control two LEDs to simulate the locking mechanism.For this how to you will needRaspberry Pi Pico running MicroPythonMFRC522 RFID readerLarge breadboard11 x Male to male jumper wiresGreen LEDRed LED2 x 100 Ohm resistors (Brown - Black - Brown - Gold)Building the Hardware (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The hardware build is split into two sections.

**Source:** IoT Business News | **Keyword:** `Business`
Key Insights (AI-assisted):
Tightening integration between intrinsically safe hardware and modern connectivity is shifting hazardous-area IoT from niche pilots to scalable deployments. As ATEX smartphones gain full cellular, GNSS, and sensor stacks, the bottleneck moves from device capability to interoperability with SCADA, MDM, and line-of-business applications. This forces OT and IT teams to converge architectures and security models, particularly on private LTE/5G. The trend reflects a broader move toward real-time, worker-centric IoT in brownfield industrial environments with stringent safety and regulatory constraints. Sensors, standards, and operational constraints in hazardous zones
A technician in a chemical plant needs to log temperature readings, check equipment vibration, and photograph a valve assembly. Standard procedure, but in a Zone 2 hazardous area, standard electronics won’t do. The risk isn’t the device itself – it’s what happens if a component fails and creates a spark, or if a surface gets hot enough to ignite surrounding gases.
Industrial IoT in petrochemical, mining, and pharmaceutical facilities comes down to collecting sensor data while ensuring equipment remains intrinsically safe.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple ships a simple but effective charging cable with the Apple Watch that will fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7 or later (Watch 8/9/10/11, Watch Ultra 1/2/3). You won’t find a faster charging accessory but you can also choose from a wide range of stylish and practical charging stands, docks and power banks for your Apple Watch—including some that can also charge other Apple devices such as your iPhone and AirPods.
Here, we round up the best Apple Watch chargers, docks and charging stands—some of which can charge your other Apple devices at the same time. Most should be compatible with all generations of the Watch, but be sure to check compatibility before buying.
See below the product chart for more on Apple Watch fast-charging, including the expected charging times of each Apple Watch.
There are simple charging cables, multi-device chargers that can power up your Apple Watch plus your iPhone and AirPods, chargers that are built for portability and travel, designer models that look great at home or in the office, and handy Apple Watch power banks.
While battery life has improved with the most recent Watch launches, particularly the Apple Watch 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3, you will still find yourself in need of recharging between one and two days.
We’ve tested a lot and selected our favorite Apple Watch chargers here.

Every Apple Watch comes with the company’s Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable. At $29 / £29 it’s not overly expensive to buy a spare or replacement, but there are more able multifunction Watch chargers available, as well as much cheaper simple cables that we would steer clear of but which we have investigated to see if we can find one we can recommend. First we start our best Apple Watch charger roundup with these simple models, and then we test the more functional and better-designed alternatives. Pros
Fast charge Watch
Simple Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal Product Price Watch fast charge: Yes
Size: 1m cable
Weight: 2.6oz (73g)

USB-C charger: Not included (20W charger required)
Apple ships its Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable with its Watch Series 7 and later models, including the Watch Series 8/9/10/11, SE 3 and Watch Ultra. (Earlier Apple Watch SE models and Series 6 and earlier Watches shipped with the Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable that lacks the fast-charging function.)
Both charging cables are Apple white and a meter long. The latest version features an enhanced charging puck that also works with the case of the AirPods Pro 2 &amp; 3 and AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation.
The 7.5W Fast Charger Cable can charge 33% faster than the older 5W cable—charging a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in just 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will support eight hours of sleep tracking.
Without fast charge, it takes about 1.5 hours to charge an Apple Watch to 80%, and about 2.5 hours to 100%.
Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger, like you’d use to charge an iPhone; find our best iPhone chargers for a wider choice that the plain Apple 20W charger.
While you can still buy the older Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable, there’s little benefit as the newer Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable is backwards compatible with older Watch models, looks the same, and is the same price. You can use the old cable on a later Watch but obviously without fast charging. Pros

Apple’s official Watch Charger is fast and reliable but expensive compared to the knock-off Watch chargers you can find online. This is a shame as having a spare in your bag or lying around at home is useful given the Watch’s pretty dreadful battery life.
Usually there is a trusted third-party provider with an alternative to Apple’s simple charging cable but we could find none for the Apple Watch that were cheaper than the Apple version. We know that the Satechi USB-C Fast Charging Cable for Apple Watch is trustworthy as it’s from one of our favorite brands, but it’s actually pricier than the Apple—so why bother, unless you prefer the shorter cable?
There are some great third-party Apple Watch charging stands and adapters—many of which we review below. But you are taking a chance (albeit a very affordable chance) by picking a cheapo simple Watch charger from Amazon, Temu or other online retailers. We bought one from Amazon that frayed its cable sitting in a bag for a few weeks. If you must, then scan the user reviews but we can’t vouch that the good ones are genuine and others often state problems with durability and extremely slow charging. You spent a bunch on your Apple Watch so why risk it going up in flames by saving a few bucks on a spare charger? Pros

Small enough to fit in your pocket, this little 5W Watch charger from Satechi can plug straight into a USB-C charger or a USB-C charging port—for example, the Thunderbolt on your MacBook or iPad, a USB-C car charger, or USB-C output power bank.
As we all know, it’s not only the Apple Watch with a weak battery. This portable Watch Charger can also be used to charge AirPods in a compatible case.
When you get an alert telling you that your Watch battery is fading, you don’t always have your meter-long Apple charging cable with you but you are likely nearer a USB-C power point, and this little Watch charger can live at the bottom of your backpack for when you need it most. Pros

The Nimble Watch charging stand can fast-charge the Watch (Series 7 and later), and weighing just 3.2oz (91g) is portable, too. It is made from sustainable plant-based aloe leather.
The magnetic charging module allows the Watch to be raised to work either lying flat or in Nightstand mode. It ships with a separate 5-foot (1.5m) USB-C but requires a USB-C wall charger. Belkin An alternative is the larger (3.8 x 3.8 x 0.63 inches) and heavier (6.8oz) Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch, which is a long name for a fairly simple square, rubberized Apple Watch charging stand. It’s a little more expensive ($59.99), too, but it is available in white as well as black. Its built-in 4-foot (1.2m) USB-C cable wraps neatly around the underside of the dock, so keeping your space clutter-free. There’s a precision dial on the bottom of the dock to raise the puck height depending on the size of your Watch.
Alternatively, you can save money by buying one of the simple Apple Watch stands that require you to connect your Watch charging cable into the basic stand. Pros

It’s simple to use once you find a USB-C port on a wall charger, your MacBook or even your iPhone (15 or later), you can lie your Watch on the pad and soon enough juice should be in your Watch so you won’t miss any of those precious active minutes. Best 2-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone chargers
If you own an Apple Watch there is a high possibility that you also own an iPhone, so why not have one versatile charger that can power up both Apple devices at the same time. Here are some of the favorites we have tested. Pros

Weight: 4.2oz (119g)
Colors: Aluminum
USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included
Twelve South has triumphed with this pocketable 2-in-1 charger that can handle iPhone and Apple Watch (or Watch and AirPods), charging the two devices simultaneously.
It is fully Apple certified, so fast wirelessly charges the Watch at 5W and the iPhone at 15W. The Watch can’t be charged faster, although you can find 25W wireless chargers for the iPhone.
But its wonder is its clever, dinky foldable size and MacBook-like styling. Unfurl the charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed. You can even fold 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nightstand mode. Flip it round, and you can set the iPhone in landscape StandBy mode.
It chips with a super-compact 30W USB-C wall charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads: US, UK, EU and AU/NZ.
The ButterFly is also our favorite Apple Watch travel charger, but it works back at base just as well. Twelve South You can buy a different (a little pricier at $99.99) version in six different colors—the Twelve South ButterFly SE uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe, so also charges at 15W, but doesn’t ship with a wall charger. Its not metal like the original Butterfly but at least with its color choices (Black, White, Pink, Coastal Blue, Iridescent, Midnight Plum) it resembles more a butterfly than a moth. Pros

Very similar to the Twelve South ButterFly, reviewed above, the Native Union Voyage is a touch larger but also a little lighter. In the same way, it’s a superb travel charger for iPhones after version 12 and Apple Watches. It can fast charge both as it uses 15W Qi2 for iPhone magnetic wireless charging (compared to the ButterFly’s 15W MagSafe but the same Qi2 standard as the ButterFly SE) and 5W for Apple Watch. AirPods can be charged on the Watch part depending on your charging needs.
It is so compact that it will easily fit in your pocket or get lost at the bottom of your backpack—the included pouch is handy in this regard, and something we hoped would be included with the ButterFly.
Like the ButterFly SE (but not the original ButterFly that ships with a 30W USB-C charger) it doesn’t come with a wall charger so you’ll need to add your own. And it is priced the same as the ButterFly SE.
It seems a shame to just compare this very neat 2-in-1 charger to the similar chargers that came before it. It does beat the Twelve South chargers in two respects. We think the Voyage will likely show less wear than the others as its silicone cover looks more hardy. And we like the fact you can just push out the Watch charging module from the back rather than risking your fingernail on the ButterFly’s notch.
Take a look at the Voyage and the ButterFly and ButterFly SE, and make your choice. You won’t be disappointed with any of these dinky and cleverly designed 2-in-1 chargers. Pros

The BoostCharge Pro looks rather like a paperweight and will delight interior designers.
Compact and low-level in an elegant organic shape, the bulb-like charging stand is made from at least 60% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic and has pleasingly soft edges and a texture that makes you stroke it longingly.
The chrome Watch-charging pad sticks out from the back of the stand, and can’t be folded in when not in use, as is possible with some compact multi-device chargers such as the Anker 3-in-1 Cube.

While it lacks an AirPods charging module like the 3-in-1 charging stations reviewed here, you can charge the AirPods wireless charging case on the top when the charging pad is flat and not charging your iPhone.

Belkin created not one but two UltraCharge Pro Convertible chargers; see also the review below. Both fold up to create a pocketable charging pad and can be unfolded to make a viewing stand. Only this version—they’re both called the same thing so bear with me—can charge both iPhone and Watch when partially folded up.
While not as design-mag gorgeous as the BoostCharge Pro Charging Dock reviewed above, the super-portable UltraCharge Pro Convertible is a foldable compact design marvel nonetheless.
Belkin designates its 15W iPhone chargers as “BoostCharge” and its 25W models as “UltraCharge”. Both will charge the Apple Watch at the same 5W but owners of the iPhone 16 and 17 series will cut around 15 minutes off their charging time with the 25W variety. Pros

It’s got the same name and near identical functions and technical specification as the Belkin UltraCharge Pro Convertible reviewed above, so the choice is all yours and may come down to price. This slightly pricier version is classier with its chrome bar and maybe that’s why Apple chose to sell this model in its Store. It’s also a bit heavier, making the cheaper version better suited to travel.
As the Watch-charging module is folded away under the pad, you can’t charge your Watch while it’s in Pad mode as you can with its non-identical twin. Pros

We list this elegant charging stand as a 2-in-1 because it can charge two types of Apple device: the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, you could argue that it’s a 3-in-1 as it has dual Watch charging pads for families or offices with more than one Apple wearable and can therefore charge two separate devices at the same time.
For such households this charger will help eliminate the need for messy individual charging cables. Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone/AirPod chargers
As well as owning an Apple Watch and iPhone, a fair few of us have further swelled Apple’s coffers by buying AirPods. These are the 3-in-1 chargers that we have tested and approve for simultaneously charging Apple Watch, Apple iPhone and Apple AirPods (with a wireless charging case). Pros

If you’ve got an Apple Watch, chances are you also own an iPhone and maybe a set of AirPods, too. Here’s where a charging station, which can power up all three devices simultaneously, becomes essential if you want to rid yourself of a snake’s nest of cables.
Previously, 3-in-1 chargers were limited to 15W wireless charging either via Apple’s MagSafe or Qi2. Apple’s own iPhone MagSafe Charger has alone been able to charge iPhone 16 and later at 25W. The new Qi2 25W standard, however, means you can get the fastest magnetic charging in a stand without needing to rig it with Apple’s charging puck. In our real-world tests using the iOS 26 beta on our iPhone 16 Pro, we saw actual charging times from 0 to 50 percent of 30-35 minutes, measurably faster than 15W MagSafe.
As with the 25W MagSafe, Qi2 25W requires at least an iPhone 16 running iOS 26 to hit the top wireless charging speed. It and this stand is backwards compatible with older iPhones going back to the iPhone 12 but is pegged back at Qi2’s older 15W limit for those iPhones.
Here we are just as interested in the UltraCharge Pro’s Apple Watch-charging prowess and this is as fast as it gets at 5W.
The base is wrapped in a beautifully soft-touch silicone, while the bar that holds the iPhone and Watch chargers look great in a shiny chrome finish. It’s not the highest stand, but the iPhone charging pad is highly adjustable— up to 70 degrees in portrait or landscape—so it can be angled as you desire. Pros

The HiRise 3 Deluxe (available at Apple) can wirelessly charge three devices—iPhone 12/13/14/15/16/17 (but not SE), Apple Watch 7, 8, 9, SE and Ultra, and Apple AirPods (2nd and 3rd gen AirPods, and all AirPods Pro). The AirPods-charging Qi wireless pad can alternatively be used to charge any iPhone from iPhone 8 up.
The iPhone 15W, Watch 5W and Qi pad 7.5W charging points allow for fast charging, but that 15W iPhone charger is now bested by Qi2 25W chargers as found on the Belkin UltraCharge Pro 3-in-1 stand reviewed above.

If you own an Apple Watch it’s a fair bet that you also have an iPhone, and, go on admit it, some AirPods, too—you’re well invested into the Apple ecosystem.
This 3-in-1 charging station from Journey has a tiltable MagSafe-certified pad (15W) for all iPhones 12/13/14/15, plus a Qi charger for AirPods that have a wireless charging case.
Important to us here, though, is the Apple Watch charger at the back, which can fast-charge your Apple wearable.
The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is similar and features a tiltable Watch charger at the front rather than the back. If you want a 3-in-1 fast charging stand in white, then pick this Journey stand or the OtterBox 3-in-1 reviewed below; if you prefer black, go for the Charcoal Belkin UltraCharge Pro.
There is a cheaper version, the Journey Trio 3-in-1 Charging Station, which features a handy detachable Watch charger that you can slip into your pocket and plug into a USB-C charger, including your MacBook, away from the base unit. While that is a neat feature (and might save you $40 on a standalone Watch adapter) the MagSafe pad is only compatible so charges the iPhone at 7.5W and the Watch charger is slower than the one featured on the Trio Ultra 3-in-1.

The first 3-in-1 device charger based on the fast MagSafe-like 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging tech, the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station not only boosts wireless charging speeds that match Apple’s MagSafe but wraps up everything into a solid, foldable and compact yet flexible design. Apple Watch fast charging is the cream on the top.
Foldable and super compact, the Anler MagGo Wireless Charging Station is a great portable option for your travels. The Watch-charging module neatly folds into the base of the charging station. It’s just as great as a permanent charger at home.
We also like Anker’s 3-in-1 Cube, reviewed below—but while it’s gorgeous, it is heavier than the MagGo and doesn’t feature Watch fast charging.
If you can live without the MagSafe wireless charging iPhone stand element, we are rather in love with another Apple Watch charger from the same company, which is also a power bank: the Anker MagGo 10K Power Bank For Apple Watch, reviewed below in our Best Apple Watch Power Banks reviews. Pros

Belkin’s Boost Up Charge Pro Wireless Charging Pad 3-in-1 charger (available at Apple) is the fastest way you can wirelessly charge both your Apple Watch and iPhone (12/13/14/15/16-series models), plus AirPods that come in a wireless charging case. It’s a flat pad so the iPhone charges lying down rather than visible as it would be on a stand.
It boasts both Watch fast charging (7.5W) and iPhone MagSafe fast charging (15W). The included 20W USB-C wall charger is a little underpowered if charging all three devices simultaneously. A 30W or 40W charger would better handle that situation.
The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, but because the iPhone lies flat you can’t take advantage of iOS 17’s StandBy mode. The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is a better option if you want to view your iPhone while it’s charging—and it also comes with a more powerful 40W power supply.
The magnetic charging module features a precision dial that can adjust the height for the best Watch, depending on the screen size. Pros

Matching the Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe in terms of charging speed, the OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station is a super-fast iPhone/Watch/AirPods charger with a small footprint—indeed, it’s a little smaller than its rival.
The charging points for iPhone and Apple Watch are fully certified—iPhone 15W and Watch 5W. At 5W, the lower Qi pad is slower than the Twelve South.
We prefer the HiRise 3 Deluxe for its tilting iPhone MagSafe pad and more flexible Watch module. But if the white color option fits your decor better than the black-only HiRise, the OtterBox 3-in-1 is a great choice. Best Apple Watch travel chargers

### 2. `EN` [Apple’s budget MacBook coming soon: What to expect](data/articles/d95e9934296ec3d2ee791238f40014c0.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple’s MacBook lineup could be in for a major shakeup. The company is reportedly planning on releasing a new, low-cost laptop that can compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops in the budget market. Such a laptop could bring the Mac to a whole new class of users.
The new MacBook may feature an aluminum design in playful colors, an A19 Pro chip, Ultra Retina XDR OLED display, fewer ports, and Apple’s C2 modem. This new, low-cost MacBook could be a very popular one, which means you’ll want to keep track of its developments. Well, look no further. This article will keep track of the rumors and reports of this upcoming product, as well as offer our perspective on the device, so keep an eye on this page for the latest. New A19 MacBook: Release date
March 4, 2026 – possible Apple is scheduled to host three “Apple Special Experiences” on March 4 in the U.S., U.K., and China. These sessions, which are expected to offer media hands-on time with new products, could provide the ideal setting for the budget MacBook’s debut.
Apple’s low-cost MacBook has been rumored for some time, with Apple leaker Jon Prosser describing a new colorful MacBook Air back in May 2021, that never materialised, but over the past year rumors have remerged suggesting that Apple does have something different coming. In June 2025, credible analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, indicated (in Chinese) that Apple would start production of the new low-cost MacBook at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025 or in the early stage of the first quarter of 2026. It’s worth emphasising that those dates refer to the manufacturing process rather than the announcement or shipping timeframe. If production began in October 2025 then it’s plausible that the budget MacBook will arrive in early 2026, potentially unveiled at a spring event, or in the run up to Apple’s March 4 ‘Experience’. In November, 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning to release a “low-cost laptop to rival Chromebooks and Windows PCs” in the first half of 2026. He said it was currently in testing at Apple and “in early production with overseas suppliers.”
On February 8, 2026, Gurman reported that the low-cost MacBook will be available “in the first half of the year.” He did not offer any specifics. And then, on February 15, he wrote that Apple’s long-rumored low-cost MacBook is expected to arrive “as early as March,” with a design that defies its price tag. What will the new MacBook be called? MacBook (probably)
No reports have been made about the official name of the laptop, but you can assume it won’t be part of the MacBook Air line. It’s being referred to as the A18 or A19 Pro MacBook, based on the chip it could have. Apple could simply call it “MacBook,” reviving the name of the discontinued 12-inch MacBook that was targeted at a similar market. Apple last updated the MacBook in 2017.
Foundry New A19 MacBook: Design
Playful colors
Aluminum chassis (not plastic) According to Mark Gurman (in February 2026), Apple’s low-cost MacBook will have a design that defies its price tag. Apple’s goal with this laptop is to make it affordable compared to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, and one way to cut costs is to make a plastic case instead of an aluminum one. However, since Apple is working to make its products carbon-neutral, it’s doubtful that it would use plastic, preferring to use aluminum or some other recyclable or carbon-free material. Therefore, it is no surprise that the new MacBook, according to Gurman, will have an aluminum chassis. There will be a new manufacturing process “designed to be both faster and more cost-effective than the one used with Apple’s current laptops,” according to Gurman. Along with the aluminum shell, Gurman reports that the new MacBook will be available in “playful colors.”
The following colours are indicated: yellow, light green, blue, silver, dark gray, and pink. Which, in the case of yellow, green and blue, does seem to match the logo Apple designed for the invites to the special events on March 4. Apple Back in June 2023 analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested the following colors: silver, blue, pink, and yellow. A19 Pro MacBook: Display
12.9-inch display – rumored
Apple currently uses a Liquid Retina (LED-backlit display with IPS technology) display in the MacBook Air, an upgrade over the original Retina displays Apple last used with the 13-inch MacBook Pro in 2022. It’s possible Apple could revert to a Retina display with squared-off corners for the A19 Pro MacBook, though it’s more likely that Apple shaves cost by using a smaller display.
On August 11, DigiTimes reported that the laptop will have a 12.9-inch display, slightly smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air. New A19 MacBook: Processor
iPhone chip: A19 Pro or A18 Pro – expected
Another way to meet the pricing goals for this new MacBook is to use a chip that isn’t as robust as the chips used in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. When Kuo first discussed the budget MacBook in his June 2025 report, he stated that Apple will use an A18 Pro, the same chip that was in the iPhone 16 Pro. Now that the A19 arrived with the iPhone 17 this is probably the more likely chip. about what the iPhone 17 can tell us about the MacBook that could use the same chip in: Is Apple’s rumored cheap MacBook hiding in plain sight? The A-series chips are used in iPhones, while M-series chips are in Macs. Both chip families are based on the same general architecture, but the M chips generally offer more processing power.
An A19 Pro (and A18 Pro) can technically do everything an M-series chip can, but it will be slower. When comparing Geekbench 6 benchmarks, the A18 Pro offered single-core performance that’s on par with the M3. However, because the A18 Pro has only 6 CPU cores, its multi-core performance is slightly behind the M1, which has 8 CPU cores. If Apple keeps everything the same, an A18 Pro MacBook will perform like an M1 MacBook Air, which, for a lot of people, has more than enough processing power. Should Apple use an A19 Pro we can expect something even better. It will draw comparison with the iPad models that are powered by Mac chips, though. MacRumors reported, in December 2025, that references to an A18 Pro MacBook appeared in a set of leaked Apple files.
New A19 MacBook: Connectivity
Apple is using its own wireless networking chip, the N1 in the iPhone 17, bringing Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 7, and Thread. It’s likely the same chips will make their way into the A19 Pro MacBook. There’s also a chance this new Mac will have cellular connectivity using Apple’s C1, C1X or yet to launch C2 modem. The C2 is likely to support mmWave. Aside from this, it’s rumored that the budget MacBook will have fewer USB ports than the MacBook Air (which has two USB-C and a magsafe charging port). This low-cost MacBook may not support Thunderbolt. New A19 MacBook: Camera
No camera?
It’s also possible that Apple opts not to include a built-in camera. Over the past several years, Apple has promoted the Mac’s Continuity Camera feature that lets you use an iPhone as a Mac webcam, as well as the upcoming macOS Tahoe Magnifier app. Apple could promote this as a webcam solution. This would be a drastic change, since it’s been a long time since Apple shipped a laptop without a camera, but it could be a possibility in order to meet the company’s price goal. New A19 MacBook: Performance Results are expressed as Geekbench scores. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. We don’t yet have the benchmarks for the A19 Pro, but the A18 Pro has 8GB of RAM, which Apple has said is the bare minimum required to run Apple Intelligence features. So, this new laptop will have at least 8GB of RAM and possibly 16GB, like the other MacBook models. Since the iPhone doesn’t offer RAM upgrades, we don’t know what Apple could charge for extra memory.
As for graphics performance, the A18 Pro has a 6-core GPU, and its Metal score in Geekbench 6’s Compute benchmark is similar to that of the M1 found in the MacBook Air. It’s not a cutting-edge performer, but it’ll handle everyday tasks without any issues. Since Apple’s other MacBooks all start at 256GB of storage, it’s nearly certain this model will come with 256GB of storage as well. New A19 MacBook: Price
The cheapest laptop Apple sells is the $999 MacBook Air. However, Walmart still sells the M1 MacBook Air with a 256GB SSD for $649 and as low as $599. The A19 Pro MacBook has been thought of as a replacement for this Walmart model, though it’s hard to believe it would be that cheap. A price that falls between $729 and $849 seems like it would fit into the MacBook lineup.
There are claims that the low-cost MacBook could start at $599, which could allow Apple to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops. Gurman reports that the new laptop will cost “well under $1,000.”
Our estimation would be around the middle of those two figures, around $749. @macworld.com A cheap MacBook…or something else. A rumor says that Apple is going to release a cheap laptop, but what if it’s actually the long-rumored iPad/Mac hybrid we’ve heard about?

Macworld According to rumors, 2026 is shaping up to be a huge year for the Mac, starting in just a couple of weeks with Apple’s first event (or “experience”) of the year. Along with the usual faster chips, Apple reportedly has new tricks up its sleeve in 2026, with several new features that will have Mac users everywhere saying, “Finally!” Here are four major overdue announcements we expect to arrive this year.

On March 4, Apple will hold a series of “experiences” in New York, London, and Shanghai, and the star is expected to be the first-ever low-cost MacBook. After tackling the mid-range market with the MacBook Air, Apple reportedly wants to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops, with a new laptop that could be as cheap as $599. Apple will reportedly use an A18 Pro or A19 Pro iPhone chip, and it will likely have a smaller screen than the Air and possibly fewer USB ports. But it will be powerful enough for everyday tasks and light work. For a lot of users, that’s all that’s needed.

### 8. `EN` [Dwindling M1 Air stock points to imminent release of a budget MacBook](data/articles/d2c060d95e8fb76ecb302498f10e357f.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple’s long-rumored cheap MacBook appears to have come a step closer to launch, with the discovery that Walmart has stopped selling new units of the low-cost M1 MacBook Air.
As first reported by PC Mag, searching for the late-2020 machine on the U.S. site with the “new” filter checked brings up three buying options: the 256GB in Space Gray or gold, and a listing for the 512GB model, which hasn’t been available since 2024. All three now show as out of stock for shipping, and the reporter was able to find just one store in his local area with units for pickup. I had a similar experience. I’m out of luck, and they’re out of stock.
David Price / Foundry (As a side note, I’ve been unable to find new units of the M1 Air in any other stores close to me, including Amazon. If you check the price-comparison table below, you’ll see if there are any in your location. If the table isn’t showing up at all, that means you’re out of luck, too.)
Retailer Price Check Product Price It isn’t clear how long Walmart has been short of stock for this machine, but we know it was on sale for the bargain price of $549 as recently as mid-December. As it’s unlikely that Walmart just happened to run out of stock after two years, it seems Apple and Walmart have decided to wind down sales.
While the decision could be related to cost-cutting measures due to memory prices ballooning, this timing adds credence to the rumors of a cheap MacBook expected within the next two weeks. Apple recently announced global “experiences” on March 4, and it’s widely rumored that it will announce a series of new entries in its iPhone, iPad, and MacBook lines in the days leading up to that. Rumors about the new MacBook claim it will use an A18 Pro iPhone chip and cost around $699, both reasons to stop selling these M1 models. Whatever the truth, we should find out soon.

### 9. `EN` [The retro iPod that never was](data/articles/7596b7a99f42abd5625ff7c4f100b0f7.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple is known for being secretive about what goes on inside its offices, whether it’s about upcoming products or things from the past. Still, from time to time, we get a glimpse into internal projects that were never meant to see the light of day. What if we told you that Apple once considered launching a “retro iPod”?
Thanks to newly published material by former Apple designer Jon Stoa, we now have a fascinating glimpse into never-before-seen marketing concepts. They not only show scrapped plans for the 2007 iPhone launch, but also concepts for what would have been a special edition iPod classic.
An iPod inspired by the 1984 Macintosh
On his resume webpage, which includes several images for ads, packaging elements, and marketing images created while working at Apple, Stoa shares some of the unreleased projects he worked on at Apple between 2006 and 2008. The most intriguing is the concept for a limited edition “retro iPod,” which would be designed to look like it came straight out of 1984.
The idea was heavily based on a growing trend of nostalgia, even 20 years ago. The material imagines an iPod based on the design of the original Macintosh with a beige finish, classic typography, and the rainbow Apple logo on the back. He writes that the device “would draw from both the present and the past to make a statement about the role of Apple and the iPod in culture, both now and then.” Apple proposed a series of names for its retro “1984” iPod. Jon Stoa Suggested names included iPod retro, iPod rewind, iPod beta, and iPod backspace, all rendered in Apple Garamond, the typography used in Apple’s marketing materials at the time.
The concept went far beyond a vintage design. The marketing material proposed preloading the iPod with some music videos from the 1980s and even classic arcade games such as Pac-Man. Distribution would have been limited, with the retro iPod only available at Apple Stores and selected boutique partners.
There’s no evidence Apple ever developed prototypes for the retro iPod. The materials appear to be unused design and marketing explorations rather than a cancelled product.
Still, the fact that someone inside Apple considered making a vintage edition of the iPod (which was at its peak in 2006) is fascinating. A retro iPod is unlikely to happen now, but it would make an intriguing device. Jon Stoa Could a retro iPod happen in 2026?
Apple officially killed the iPod brand in 2022 when it discontinued the iPod touch, but the more classic iPod nano and iPod shuffle disappeared years earlier. Even so, some people are still calling for the return of the iPod in some form.
Some fans would instantly buy an iPod classic, while others would like a reimagined version of the iPod that blends today’s technologies with the essence of the original iPod.
If Apple were to revisit the idea today, it likely wouldn’t be a straight reissue. Instead, we could imagine a compact device the size of the iPod classic, but built with today’s materials and components. A modern OLED or mini-LED display, haptic feedback to simulate the tactile feel of the Click Wheel, expanded storage options, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support, and deep integration with Apple Music.
Whether Apple would embrace this idea of looking back at its hardware is another question. The company typically prefers to move forward and rarely celebrates milestones such as product anniversaries. But it’s hard to imagine a limited-edition device like this not selling out instantly. The Apple Store cube on 5th Avenue in New York City could have had a light projection show ahead of the iPhone’s launch. Jon Stoa The canceled iPhone event
Stoa’s material also sheds light on Apple’s pre-launch strategy for the original iPhone.
According to the documents, Apple had considered hosting another press event on June 26, 2007, just three days before the iPhone officially went on sale. The event was to be held at The California Theatre in San Jose. Attendees would have received an iPhone-shaped gift card to spend on the iTunes Store.
However, the event never happened.

### 10. `EN` [No, Apple won’t drop USB-C from the iPhone 18](data/articles/35940d125bc3496954dcdb09c3e96172.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Most iPhone fans are currently focused on the imminent launch of the iPhone 17e, which could be here in a matter of days. But one dubious rumor doing the rounds on social media right now concerns a flagship phone from the next generation. It’s just a shame that it’s almost certainly wrong.
This TikTok video, which at the time of writing has been viewed more than 17 million times, purports to show the charging port of the iPhone 18. (Or “iPhone18,” as it’s labelled by the clearly knowledgeable maker.) But rather than the USB-C port, which has been used on all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 15 in 2023, the animation shows something more akin to the MagSafe connector that appears on newer MacBooks. This video might look cool, but it’s not going to happen. TikTok The charging cable, which has a rather nice black braided cord, attaches via a magnetic connection. When it’s in place a green LED lights up on the charger head, and a small green lightning bolt is shown at the bottom of the previously blank phone screen. (Never mind that iPhones don’t behave like this; it’s the least of our worries.) It looks very similar to the MagSafe cable on my 2021 MacBook Pro, except with three pins instead of five and a chunkier body.
Now, the video doesn’t list its sources; we don’t get the usual “supply-chain sources” or “people with knowledge of the matter.” It’s just an animation. So in some ways it’s quite difficult to refute: where did this information come from? Who said this was likely? Is this simply a concept that an illustrator dreamed up, like this animation from the same channel showing possible iPhone 18 Pro colors?
Whatever the video’s intention, it’s getting major traction from viewers who think it’s real. A quick browse through a handful of the 9,700-odd reveals viewer after viewer complaining about Apple’s foolishness in doing this, or the impracticality of the design. A few appear to be Android fans mocking iPhone users for their misfortune. I couldn’t find any pointing out that this is extraordinarily unlikely to happen.
Because, as several commenters argue, it wouldn’t be a practical solution. It would disconnect very easily, and unlike on the MacBook, disconnecting easily isn’t necessary to protect it from a specific type of accident. It would annoy customers and accessories makers. And it could create problems with the EU, who mandated USB-C connectors on all smartphones sold in its territory.
What may have happened is that someone has got confused between MagSafe on the iPhone and MagSafe on the Mac. They’re both charging standards that use a magnetic connection to keep the charging points in place, but in most other respects they’re totally different. (For example, the phone’s magnetic connection is stronger so that it remains connected if you nudge the device, whereas the laptop is designed to detach if you trip on the wire.) The iPhone 17 already has the phone version of MagSafe, and the iPhone 18 will too, but that doesn’t mean it will have the Mac version as well. If nothing else, it would be enormously confusing.
Whereas the iPhone 17e is expected to be here in time for Apple’s “experience” on March 4, the first 18-series iPhones won’t arrive until September. And the actual iPhone 18, the cheaper baseline model, might not turn up until the following spring. So bookmark our iPhone 18 superguide to keep up with all the latest news and rumors.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
As we approach the launch of the iPhone 17e, MacRumors videographer Dan Barbera decided to take a look back at the iPhone 16e. He goes over what it's been like using Apple's budget ‌iPhone‌ over the past 12 months, and whether it's worth choosing over one of Apple's more expensive models. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ is $599, so it's $200 cheaper than the iPhone 17. ‌iPhone 16e‌ buyers didn't miss much in terms of performance or battery life compared to those who bought Apple's more expensive iPhones, but the device does only have a single camera, which is one of the main downsides. MagSafe, which is majorly inconvenient since ‌MagSafe‌ charging is so prevalent. There's no Camera Control button, but that's easy to do without. Dynamic Island, and it only comes in black or white so there are no fun colors to choose from. Other than the camera, design, and ‌MagSafe‌ shortcomings, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ is remarkably similar to Apple's other iPhones and you're not going to notice much in the way of day-to-day differences between the ‌iPhone 16e‌ and a higher-end model. We definitely don't recommend buying an ‌iPhone 16e‌ right now, but the ‌iPhone‌ 17e that's going to launch very soon will absolutely be worth considering over Apple's more expensive flagship iPhones. Rumors suggest the ‌iPhone‌ 17e is going to solve some of the problems that we had with the ‌iPhone 16e‌. It could get a ‌Dynamic Island‌ for the first time, adding all of the ‌Dynamic Island‌ features like Live Activities, and it's supposedly going to be updated with ‌MagSafe‌. We're also expecting Apple's upgraded C1X modem and the same A19 chip that's in the ‌iPhone 17‌. Related Roundup: iPhone 16e

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple launched a new series of iPhones at the end of 2025: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, as well as a brand new iPhone Air, but there was no new iPhone 17e for those hoping for an update to the budget iPhone.
This wasn’t a surprise: Apple released the iPhone 16e in February 2025 to replace the iPhone SE, so an update to the iPhone “e” series phones wasn’t expected to arrive until early 2026.
If you’re considering buying an iPhone 17e, this is the place to keep up to date on its development. We’ll keep track of the latest reports and provide our analysis to help you decide if the iPhone 17e is the right phone for you.
What’s new since the last update to this article: It’s a year since the iPhone 16e launch on February 19 2025, will the iPhone 17e arrive today? Probably not, but it’s likely to arrive before, or on, March 4. At a glance: iPhone 17e vs iPhone 16e Specification / FeatureiPhone 16eiPhone 17e Launch / ReleaseFebruary 2025March 4 (Possible)

March 4 launch – possible The iPhone 16e arrived on February 19, 2025, so there was some hope that Apple could introduce its replacement on February 19 a year later… With that date now here it’s looking unlikely. However, there is an “Apple Special Experience” coming up on March 4, 2026, with media being invited to meet Apple execs in at least three global locations. It’s generally thought these meetings will tie to new Apple product launches. There are a number of other new product launches expected including a refreshed iPad Air, new entry-level iPad, M5 MacBook Air, M5 Pro/MaxMacBook Pro, and a brand new low cost MacBook.
An event on March 4 – even if Apple isn’t referring to it as an event – is good timing for Apple to launch the new iPhone 17e because it is right in the middle of the Mobile World Congress. According to various reports, the iPhone 17e has entered test production runs to prepare it for a spring 2026 release.
A rumor in early January said the iPhone 17e will go into production following CES (which ended January 9). This is unsurprising, as it follows the same pattern as the iPhone 16e. iPhone 17e: Specs: What’s new for the iPhone 17e
A19 with one fewer GPU than iPhone 17 – likely
MagSafe support – likely
C1X modem – possible
256GB SSD – possible
Apple’s decision to introduce the iPhone 16e in February 2025 represented a significant shift in its product strategy, moving away from the sporadic release cycle of the iPhone SE toward a more predictable, annual “e-series” lineup. This transition was driven by several strategic imperatives, ranging from the necessity of supporting new AI technologies to the desire to test in-house hardware components in a lower-risk environment. To maintain a starting price of $599 while including the high-end A18 chip, Apple made several calculated omissions that differentiate the 16e from the standard iPhone 16. The iPhone 17e is expected to address some of the shortcomings of the iPhone 16e with a few key design refinements (a Dynamic Island is rumored), more storage at the entry-level, MagSafe support and an updated processor (the A19).
Processor: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and others have reported that the iPhone 17e will have an A19 chip, which is no real surprise. If this is the case, it may be a slightly less powerful than the A19 chip used by the iPhone 17. Apple uses binned chips in the “e” series, so Tte A18 in the iPhone 16e has one fewer GPU core than the A18 in the standard iPhone 16; and the A19 in the iPhone 17e will likely have one fewer GPU core than the iPhone 17.
MagSafe: A December 2025 report in The Information claimed that Apple will add MagSafe support to the iPhone 17e, one of the features that is notably missing from the 16e. When we reviewed the 16e, the lack of MagSafe was one of its major shortcomings. A Macworld source in February 2026 claimed that the iPhone 17e will feature 25W MagSafe wireless charging.
Modem: Apple’s C1 modem first appeared in the iPhone 16e, and rumors suggest the iPhone 17e will use the same modem. However, it could take the newer C1X modem as found in the iPhone 17 series, which is apparently two times faster than the C1 while using 30% less energy.
Storage: There are suggestions that the iPhone 17e could follow the iPhone 17 with 256GB at the starting point, up from 128GB. However, in February 2026 Apple leaker, John Prosser said he expects the baseline storage to stay at 128GB. iPhone 17e: How the iPhone 17e display will be different
Dynamic Island instead of notch – possible Notch vs Dynamic Island.
David Price / Foundry Screen size: The iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch screen, which is larger than that of the iPhone 16 (6.1-inch). The iPhone 17e is not expected to get a bigger screen. It will likely sport a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate, the same as the iPhone 16e. Dynamic Island: Digital Chat Station reported in August 2025 that the display will have a Dynamic Island – a change from the notch on the iPhone 16e.
OLED: In December 2025, Korean website, The Elec reported that BOE will provide OLED displays to Apple for the iPhone 17e. BOE also provided OLEDs for the iPhone 16e. Samsung Display and LG Display are expected to also provide 17e displays. Bezels: The display, according to The Elec, will have thinner bezels than the 16e. iPhone 17e: Cameras
18MP front camera with square sensor – likely
The iPhone 17e will likely continue to have a single 48MP camera on the back but the 12MP camera on the front (as seen on the iPhone 16e) could get an update in line with the iPhone 17 series). The front-facing cameras across the iPhone 17 range have all been updated to 18MP, so it is possible that the iPhone 17e will see the same update to the selfie camera. If so, it will also include a square sensor capable of taking photos in any orientation without requiring the user to rotate the phone. The notch may be replaced by the Dynamic Island in the iPhone 17e. Foundry | Alex Walker-Todd iPhone 17e: Design &amp; Colors
Digital Island likely to be only visible external change
Colors: There have been no reports relating to the iPhone 17e’s colors. The iPhone 16e is available in black or white, and we expect the same for the iPhone 17e.
Design: No changes are expected for the design, although, as mentioned above, the new iPhone 17e could have a Digital Island instead of the notch at the top of the screen. There is a possibility that the there could be thinner bezels than the 16e, according to The Elec. iPhone 17e: Price
Starting at $599
A January 2026 report on Wccftech suggests that Apple has been able to reduce costs for the new iPhone 17e, so that the price won’t increase. This is thanks to lower costs for the OLED panels Apple is using. The iPhone 16e starts at $599/£599, and Apple is expected to price the iPhone 17e at $599 as well, though no reports have been made so far. Tariffs and production cost increases may affect the price, but since the “e” series is considered Apple’s lowest-priced iPhone, the price would not exceed that of the iPhone 17, which starts at $799, and the iPhone 16, whose price has been reduced to start at $699.

### 15. `EN` [ChatGPT is your iPhone’s secret superpower](data/articles/741a4c823aae478a599df55d9f9db481.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld AI is rapidly being integrated into the hardware and services we depend on, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. While Apple’s in-house AI models remain relatively limited for now, Apple users have other options: most appealingly, the company has natively baked OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT into its systems. This enables you to easily fetch up-to-date information, polish text, generate images, and much more.
If you’re not already using AI to accelerate your everyday workflows, it’s time to get with the program. Try these 10 ChatGPT features on your Apple devices of choice, and watch your productivity skyrocket.
Applets
OpenAI recently launched ChatGPT apps as a way to access your favorite services using text prompts. The feature is available in the latest ChatGPT app across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and the web. To get started, you can visit the Apps section in ChatGPT settings and connect the accounts you’re interested in.
For example, the Apple Music applet lets you find songs, generate playlists, and add them to your library right from ChatGPT. Similarly, the Adobe Acrobat offering enables you to upload a PDF document and make certain tweaks using the chatbot’s interface.
As you’d probably expect, the functionality of these apps is somewhat limited. They’re cut-down versions of the full app, a little like Apple’s App Clips, and more advanced workflows will still require the use of the real thing. But they’re solid for performing specific, quick tasks using natural language. There wasn’t much AI in the 90s, but we made up for it with our indie music. Mahmoud Itani / Foundry macOS assistance
ChatGPT’s integration with apps isn’t confined to the limited range of applets available on the platform itself. If you’ve installed the official client on your Mac, you’ll be able to link it to active macOS app sessions and ask relevant questions.
Simply tap on the App Store icon in the ChatGPT app’s text box to view a list of compatible, installed apps. If you pick Terminal, for instance, it will read the commands you’re entering and help you type the correct ones to achieve a certain aim. Likewise, it can view the notes you’re typing and suggest edits based on your prompt.
Quick access
Locate the ChatGPT app on your Home Screen can be inefficient when performing time-sensitive tasks. Fortunately, ChatGPT offers a ton of shortcuts to quickly summon it on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
On iOS and iPadOS, you can add ChatGPT controls to the Control Center and Lock Screen, letting you quickly initiate a new session from different parts of the system; on newer iPhones, you can also have the Action button launch a ChatGPT instance. On the Mac, you can hit Option and Space to reveal a miniature ChatGPT text box to enter your prompts, connect apps, upload files, and so on. You can also add ChatGPT to shortcuts you create in the Apple Shortcuts app and have it analyze input or fetch requested data.
Siri fallback
Siri often fails to answer basic questions and instead redirects users to web results. If you’ve enabled Apple Intelligence, however, the voice assistant can now tap into ChatGPT’s intellect instead. To turn this on, open the Settings app, go to Apple Intelligence and Siri &gt; ChatGPT, and enable the Use ChatGPT toggle. (You can also turn off the Confirm Requests option if you’d rather not have Siri ask for your permission every time it needs to share a text prompt with ChatGPT’s servers.) Now, you can command Siri to ask ChatGPT any question, and it’ll read aloud the response it receives.
Writing Tools
This neat text editing suite allows you to natively proofread, rewrite, summarize, and change the tone of selected text. Thanks to ChatGPT, the feature also lets you apply custom edits or generate text from scratch. Just select the text you’d like to edit, then hit Writing Tools, followed by Compose. You can then describe the changes you’d like to make and ChatGPT will handle the rest. ChatGPT offers a range of preset styles when generating images.
Mahmoud Itani / Foundry Image Playground
Image Playground is Apple’s own AI image generator, featuring multiple illustration styles, doodle polishing support, offline access, and more. To elevate the quality of outputted images, you can rely on ChatGPT’s superior image generation models without leaving the app. Click the Styles dropdown menu in the Playground app on iOS, iPadOS, or macOS, then select ChatGPT. You can then pick a more specific style, such as Anime, Vector, or Oil Painting. Now you can type your prompt or add some of the suggested ones and wait for the result to appear.
Paid perks and data sync
Using ChatGPT integration on your Apple devices comes with daily limits that, when exceeded, prevent you from uploading files, generating images, and accessing advanced models. If you’re subscribed to ChatGPT Go, Plus, or Pro, you can link your paid account to extend or remove said limits. In Settings, go to Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri &gt; ChatGPT, and sign in with your OpenAI account. This will also sync the conversations you have with ChatGPT via Siri and show them in your chat history.
Group chats
Lastly, if you’re planning an event or working on a project with others, you can create a group chat in the ChatGPT app. To get started, tap on the dedicated button in the top-right corner of a ChatGPT conversation and share the link with your friends or coworkers. This lets you all brainstorm together and have ChatGPT share its knowledge whenever needed. ChatGPT can contribute to group chats.
Mahmoud Itani / Foundry Shopping advice
Picking the right model when upgrading your Apple device can be confusing for tech newbies. Obviously, Macworld should be your first stop when seeking iPhone, iPad, or Mac buying advice, but ChatGPT is keen to join the party with its Shopping Research feature.
Select the relevant mode in the ChatGPT app and describe the product you’re looking to buy. ChatGPT will ask follow-up questions related to budget and performance expectations to narrow down your options, then display results comparing the prices, specs, images, and other relevant aspects of the matching devices. You can then choose one of them and buy it through your favorite online retailer.
Understanding your iDevices
ChatGPT can also help tech newbies learn more about their Apple devices and the latest OS features. Again, Macworld has long been happy to help in this regard, but who are we to stand in the way of progress? It’s far better, clearly, to ask a chatbot.
ChatGPT can, for example, check the latest available OS version for your device and briefly list the top features it introduces using simple language. This helps you familiarize yourself with what’s new, without having to read complex changelogs. Similarly, if you encounter errors when using your Apple devices, you can upload screenshots to ChatGPT or use the video calling mode to show it what’s going on in real time. The chatbot will then suggest solutions or workarounds based on similar issues discussed on online forums. Or beloved Apple-focused websites.

They all solved the problem of having to fish your keys out, but they never quite solved the problem of “my hands are full.” Even with Home Key, you’d still have to either get your Apple Watch to your lock or pull out your iPhone. Yes, plenty of locks offer various flavors of auto-unlock, but none are perfect and work 100% of the time. That is the problem Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology aims to solve.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld As we have extensively covered, Apple is rumored to soon introduce new products, as the company recently confirmed a special announcement for March 4. Among the expected products are a low-cost MacBook and a new generation of Studio Display.
If you needed more evidence that these products will soon be arriving in stores, here’s proof from Apple itself. Code from macOS 26.3, released last week to the public, confirms the existence of such devices.
As discovered by Macworld, the final build of macOS 26.3 released to the public on February 11 includes kernel extensions (kexts) for three new devices identified as J700, J427, and J527. The codenames match previous reports, including those based on an internal build of iOS 26 leaked last year.
Low-cost MacBook essentially confirmed
J700 is the codename for the rumored new low-cost MacBook. This Mac is expected to be priced lower than the current MacBook Air, and will be the first Apple silicon Mac to be powered by an A-series chip instead of an M-series one.
More specifically, the new entry-level MacBook will reportedly have the same A18 Pro chip as the iPhone 16 Pro models. Benchmark tests show that the A18 Pro performs slightly better than the M1, which is good enough for most casual users who will be the target audience for this new laptop.
More recently, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the laptop will have a display that’s slightly under 13 inches and will be made of aluminum, despite its lower price. Some analysts believe it will cost as low as $599, but a price between $699 and $799 is more likely. Apple’s Studio Display is nearly four years old and in need of an update. Foundry Studio Display 2 may have an extra surprise
In addition to the highly anticipated MacBook, macOS 26.3 includes drivers for two other unreleased devices: J427 and J527, both variants of a new generation of Studio Display.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld TL;DR: This MacBook Air is only $199.97 right now, and shipping is free.
The RAM shortage is already starting to affect computer prices, but it hasn’t touched refurbished devices yet. If you need a low-cost computer for the basics, this MacBook Air is still a good option for only $199.97 (MSRP $999).
Inside, this MacBook has a 1.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB solid-state drive. That combination is enough for web browsing, note-taking, light photo work, and office productivity. The 13.3-inch display has a 1440×900 resolution, which is sharp enough for documents and video without hammering the battery. You also get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you can connect to wireless networks, headphones, and other accessories without hassle. Fully charged, the battery can last up to 12 hours, which gives you plenty of room during busy days when you can’t sit down at an outlet.
This unit has a Grade “A/B” refurbished rating, which means it’s fully tested but may have light scuffs or small marks on the case. That’s also why the price is so low. It can update to macOS Monterey, which keeps it compatible with most modern software, though it will not move to newer macOS 26 releases. You also get a MagSafe charger in the box and a limited third-party warranty.
Shipping is free.
Right now, you can get a MacBook Air on sale for $199.97.

Macworld TL;DR: CleanMy Phone scans duplicates, compresses media, and organizes your camera roll so your iPhone feels new again — for just $19.99.
You know the warning: “iPhone Storage Full.” Suddenly, you’re speed-deleting photos from 2017, removing apps you still probably need, and debating whether one blurry brunch pic is worth iCloud rent.
Instead, there’s an affordable and easy solution.
CleanMy Phone (now $19.99, normally $44.99) acts like a spring cleaning crew for your camera roll. The app scans your device and intelligently finds duplicate photos, giant videos, forgotten screenshots, and low-quality shots you didn’t realize were multiplying.
The surprisingly helpful part? It doesn’t just delete — it suggests. AI highlights the best image in a group, compresses videos without wrecking quality, and can even convert Live Photos to standard shots to save serious space.
Everything runs locally on your device, so your photos never leave your phone. No uploading, no weird privacy tradeoffs — just a cleaner library.
It also shows real-time storage analytics, so you finally understand why 40GB vanished overnight (spoiler: videos and memes).
Instead of upgrading storage again, you might just clean it up.
Because most phones don’t need replacing — they need organizing.
Get CleanMy Phone for your iPhone or iPad while it’s just $19.99 (MSRP $44.99). CleanMyPhone Cleanup Storage AppSee Deal

This 13-inch MacBook Pro comes with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 quad-core processor that runs at 2.0GHz, so everyday work like browsing, video calls, and document editing feels smooth. It has 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which is plenty of space for apps, photos, and big project files, and it helps the system stay responsive when you have a lot open at once.
The 13.3-inch Retina display runs at 2560×1600 resolution with True Tone, so text looks sharp, and colors are vivid while the screen adjusts to the lighting in your room. Intel Iris Plus graphics handle streaming, light creative work, and general use without drama. The backlit Magic Keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, and the Touch Bar and Touch ID give you quick shortcuts and fingerprint login.
You get four Thunderbolt 3 ports that handle charging, external displays, and fast storage through USB-C. Wireless connections use 802.11ac Wi Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 for modern routers and accessories.
This Grade A refurbished unit should arrive in near-mint condition, with only minor signs of use. It weighs about 3.1 pounds, comes with a charger, and includes a limited third-party warranty.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Listen, we love MacBooks around here, but we hate paying Apple’s storage upgrade prices. That’s why today’s deal is so good: B&amp;H Photo is selling the M5 MacBook Pro with 1TB of storage space for $1,599, the same price as the 512GB version. Now that’s a deal worth getting!
So, the 14-inch MacBook Pro M5 is an absolute beast of a laptop that we gave a 4.5-star rating to and our Editors’ Choice award. We loved the improved CPU and GPU performance, as well as how speedy the drive is. We concluded that “the M5 MacBook Pro offers a great combination of price and performance.” And with this deal, you’ll get twice the storage without paying a penny more
The model’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR Display delivers crisp visuals and vibrant colors, as well as an amazing 1,000 nits of brightness that will make it easy to use the laptop in any lighting situation. The laptop also features a slew of ports, including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, USB-C, and an SD card reader, as well as MagSafe for power.

Google has added three new features to the Chrome desktop browser, including split view for multitasking, PDF annotations, and a Save to Google Drive option. Split view for Chrome is a built-in tool that supports using two tabs at the same time side-by-side. Google says that it provides a more streamlined, flexible way to work. There is a split view icon in Chrome that can be clicked to enter the new view. With PDF annotations, the Chrome PDF Viewer can be used to highlight text, insert signatures, and add notes.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple has a new AirTag for sale, but you’re probably not rushing out to buy one since you can still get the old ones for cheaper. But this deal may change your mind: Costco is throwing in a free AirTag when you buy a 4-pack for $100, essentially giving you five new AirTags for the price of 4, a savings of $45 on the price of buying five AirTags individually. (Note: You don’t need to be a member to take advantage of this deal.)
Apple’s 2nd-gen of AirTags have the same size as the previous model, and they look virtually the same. However, they have a louder speaker, which will make them easier to find even if your keys somehow ended up between couch cushions. Apple also upgraded the Bluetooth chip inside the tracker, expanding the range at which items can be located.
Also new is the U2 Ultra Wideband chip, which will make it possible to more precisely locate lost items, something that will definitely be handy. We’ve already tested the new AirTag 2 and gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, finding it to be a simple and efficient Bluetooth tracker that’s also super easy to set up and fairly inexpensive.

Vous voulez vous engager pour une cause, rencontrer de nouvelles personnes et découvrir la cartographie participative et humanitaire? CartONG vous invite à participer à un ou plusieurs mapathons en ligne! ​​
Venez cartographier les régions encore absentes des cartes pour soutenir les organisations humanitaires et de solidarité internationale qui ont besoin de cartes précises et à jour pour agir plus efficacement en cas de crise ou initier des projets de développement local.
Les ateliers de cartographie sont organisés dans le cadre du projet Missing Maps, qui a pour objectif de cartographier de façon préventive les régions vulnérables aux catastrophes naturelles, crises sanitaires, environnementales, aux conflits et à la pauvreté. On peut penser qu’aujourd’hui toutes les parties du monde sont cartographiées, mais en réalité de nombreuses régions ne possèdent encore aucune carte!
​ Pour qui? Pas besoin d’être un·e expert·e, les ateliers sont accessibles à tout le monde!
​ Où ? 100% en ligne! Un lien de connexion vous sera envoyé après votre inscription
​ ? Avec la plateforme de cartographie libre et contributive OpenStreetMap (OSM, le «Wikipédia des cartes») tout le monde peut participer à la cartographie de n’importe quelle zone de la planète: il suffit d’un ordinateur, d’une souris et d’une connexion internet! Accessibles à tout·es, nous serons là pour vous accompagner pour vos premiers pas avec OSM.
Le programme des mapathons
18h00: Introduction, présentation de la cartographie collaborative et solidaire et démonstration OSM pour les nouveaux·elles
18h30: On cartographie tous ensemble sur un projet
20h00: Fin du mapathon, conclusion sur les contributions de la soirée

Le nombre de personnes simultanément présentes dans les locaux sera limité à 10 personnes. Les inscriptions sur meetup sont donc recommandées (les inscrits seront prioritaires).
C’est une bonne occasion pour les curieux de venir découvrir ce que l’on peut faire dans un espace de fabrication numérique collaboratif, ouvert et communautaire comme le LAB.

gull, paulla, logiciels-libres, projets, futur, assemblée-générale [FR Paris] Soirée de contribution au libre – Le jeudi 12 février 2026 de 19h30 à 22h00.
Le but des soirées de contribution au libre est de proposer un espace de travail partagé aux personnes actives dans le libre en Île-de-France le temps d’une soirée, une fois par mois (le deuxième jeudi du mois plus précisément).
Dit plus court: c’est un lieu avec de l’électricité et une connexion internet. En avant les claviers !
Les soirées de contribution au libre sont faites pour vous si:
vous travaillez sur un projet libre et vous recherchez une atmosphère à la fois conviviale et studieuse pour aller de l’avant et, qui sait, créer des connexions avec d’autres projets libres, vous êtes un collectif autour du libre et vous cherchez un lieu pour vous retrouver physiquement et avancer avec efficacité sur vos chantiers. Si vous n’avez pas envie de contribuer à un projet libre, les soirées de contribution au libre ne sont sans doute pas faites pour vous. Pas de panique, Parinux organise d’autres évènements:
si vous voulez discuter autour du libre: l’Apéro du Libre (APL) est là pour ça ; c’est un rendez-vous fixé tous les 15 du mois ; venez-nous retrouver autour d’un verre pour papoter et refaire le monde (libre), si vous avez un problème informatique: c’est la vocation de Premiers Samedi du Libre (PSL) où vous pourrez trouver des oreilles attentives et compétentes à l’écoute de toutes vos questions. Nous nous réservons le droit de refuser l’entrée aux soirées de contribution au libre à tout personne qui n’en respecterait pas l’esprit. Et, bien sûr, les règles de bienséance habituelles s’appliquent pour que chacune et chacun se sente à l’aise dans un cadre bienveillant.
Si les soirées de contribution vous intéressent, le mieux est de contacter d’abord le CA de Parinux ca@parinux.org. Vous devrez de toute façon nous écrire pour obtenir le code de la porte cochère…

### 3. `FR` [Nouvelles de Haiku - Hiver 2025-26](data/articles/5513552cd42722ebbaddda91c1eba20d.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Haiku est un système d’exploitation pensé pour les ordinateurs de bureau. Il est basé sur BeOS mais propose aujourd’hui une implémentation modernisée, performante, et qui conserve les idées qui rendaient BeOS intéressant: une interface intuitive mais permettant une utilisation avancée, une API unifiée et cohérente, et une priorisation de l’interface graphique par rapport à la ligne de commande pour l’administration du système.
Il ne s’agit pas d’une distribution Linux, mais d’un système complet avec son propre noyau, sa propre pile graphique, etc. L’idée de cette approche est d’avoir une seule équipe travaillant sur toute la pile logicielle, pour éviter les soucis de coordination entre projets indépendant et d’excès de modularité, qui peuvent aboutir à une architecture logicielle inefficace. En revanche, cela demande un gros travail pour une équipe relativement réduite, et le système est donc en développement depuis bientôt un quart de siècle sans avoir encore publié une version majeure complète.
La cinquième version beta a été publiée en 2024. Les développements continuent pour stabiliser, optimiser et peaufiner le système, avec une version beta 6 prévue en début de cette année, qui sera probablement suivie par une beta 7 quelque temps plus tard.
Cette série de dépêches est basée sur les rapports d’activité publiés mensuellement par le projet Haiku. Cette édition couvre les modifications de Haiku numérotées entre hrev59111 et hrev59355 (soit 244 changements individuels), en plus d’activités se déroulant hors du dépôt Git principal.
Entre parenthèses est indiqué le pseudonyme de l’auteur ou autrice principal·e du changement. Des pseudonymes sont utilisés par habitude (venant des canaux IRC et/ou de la culture de la demoscene) et aussi pour préserver l’identité des personnes qui le souhaitent (certains participants utilisent également leur nom légal, d’autres pas). lien nᵒ 1 : Dépêche trimestrielle précédente

Mise à jour de haiku-format
À quand la beta 6?
Mise à jour de Go en version 1.18
Le mois de novembre a vu l’arrivée d’une grosse mise à jour de la chaîne d’outils pour le langage Go en version 1.18. Il s’agit d’une version de 2022, mais c’est un gros progrès puisque la version précédente disponible pour Haiku était la version 1.4 datant de 2014. De plus, cette version 1.18 est disponible dans le dépôt de paquets et peut être installée normalement avec pkgman (au moins pour les architectures x86 et x86_64).
La plus grande partie du travail a été réalisée par Korli, depuis plusieurs années, pour mettre en place l’environnement de compilation nécessaire, et aussi corriger de nombreux problèmes de compatibilité POSIX dans Haiku qui ont été mis en évidence par les tests de Go.
Cela permet par exemple d’utiliser Hugo, le générateur de site statique utilisé pour le site principal de Haiku. Waddlesplash a donc pu rédiger et vérifier le rapport d’activité de novembre en utilisant uniquement Haiku : avec Hugo, WebPositive (le navigateur natif de Haiku, basé sur WebKit), l’éditeur de texte Koder, ainsi que Iceweasel (un portage de Firefox) pour la correction d’orthographe.
Redémarrage automatique de app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique de Haiku. Il s’agit d’un composant critique, pour lequel un crash rend le système à peu près inutilisable. Waddlesplash a corrigé plusieurs problèmes dans le code pour permettre de redémarrer le serveur après un crash, et de le reconnecter avec les applications en cours d’exécution. Ce redémarrage nécessite encore quelques étapes manuelles car les crash démarrent actuellement le debugger automatiquement, mais cela peut être changé par une simple configuration.
Applications
ActivityMonitor
ActivityMonitor affiche sous forme graphique divers paramètres du système: charge CPU, consommation mémoire… Il peut s’exécuter dans une fenêtre ou bien être intégré au bureau sous forme d’un « réplicant ».
Affichage d’un message « pas de capteurs de température » à la place du graphe de température du système si l’information n’est pas disponible (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème de localisation, certains fichiers sources n’étaient pas pris en compte et les chaînes contenues dedans ne pouvaient pas être traduites (humdinger).
Terminal
Le Terminal permet d’exécuter des applications en ligne de commande.
Synchronisation du presse-papier interne du Terminal avec celui du système seulement une fois au démarrage de l’application, et pas lors du changement d’onglet comme cela avait été implémenté au trimestre précédent (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème qui masquait le signal SIGUSR1 pour les shells et autres processus lancés dans le terminal (korli).
Implémentation des séquences d’échappement permettant aux applications CLI de définir des liens hypertextes (en complément des liens qui étaient déjà détectés automatiquement par le terminal en fonction du contenu du texte) (korli).
HaikuDepot
HaikuDepot est l’interface graphique du gestionnaire de paquets. Il utilise un backend en ligne en Java pour stocker et récupérer les captures d’écrans, et notes d’utilisateurs, icônes des paquets, liste de paquets mis en avant, et d’autres informations.
L’application est plus robuste en cas de problème de réseau : gestion des erreurs et affichage de messages clairs pour l’utilisateur. Gestion en particulier des erreurs 503 remontées par l’API web utilisée par HaikuDepot (apl).
Ajout de filtres pour trouver facilement les applications « natives » (n’utilisant pas Qt ou GTK) et d’un filtre « desktop » pour trouver les applications graphiques (et filtrer un très grand nombre de paquets de bibliothèques, applications en ligne de commande…) (apl, avec des améliorations par humdinger pour clarifier la terminologie).
Amélioration de la taille de la fenêtre des conditions d’utilisation sur les écrans haute densité (nipos).
Refonte de la gestion des identifiants de messages internes à l’application HaikuDepot pour en simplifier la maintenance (apl).
Interdiction de la sélection multiple dans la liste des paquets (apl).
WebPositive
WebPositive est le navigateur web fourni avec Haiku. Il est basé sur le moteur WebKit, co-développé avec Apple, Sony, Igalia et d’autres participants.
Modification du message envoyé au Tracker pour ouvrir le dossier contenant un fichier (par exemple un téléchargement), pour utiliser le message officiellement prévu à cet effet plutôt qu’un moyen détourné (humdinger).
Meilleure gestion des noms de fichiers longs dans la fenêtre de téléchargements avec l’ajout d’une barre de défilement horizontal (mull, avec un petit correctif par humdinger pour corriger un décalage d’un pixel du positionnement de la barre de défilement).
Un chantier est en cours pour réintégrer à nouveau le portage de WebKit pour Haiku dans les sources upstream. Cela avait déjà été fait en 2010, mais n’avait pas été maintenu par la suite, ce qui a conduit à retirer ce code. Depuis, Haiku utilise un fork resynchronisé régulièrement, mais cela génère du travail en plus. L’envoi du code est aussi l’occasion de faire relire toutes les modifications par les autres développeurs de WebKit, avec des conseils pour améliorer et simplifier l’architecture.
Expander
Expander est une application permettant de décompresser des archives.
Correction d’un décalage d’un pixel de la barre de défilement (humdinger).
AboutSystem
AboutSystem affiche quelques informations sur le système et surtout la liste des auteurs de Haiku.
Simplification du code pour la mise à jour automatique des couleurs, mise en place de la mise à jour automatique des couleurs pour la liste des crédits (si on passe en mode sombre par exemple) (jscipione).
Ouverture de la fenêtre avec une taille respectant les proportions du nombre d’or, esthétiquement plus plaisant (axeld).
LaunchBox
LaunchBox est un « dock » permettant de stocker des raccourcis vers des applications ou fichiers fréquemment utilisés.
Correction de la couleur du panneau de LaunchBox, et d’autres couleurs dans le sélectionneur de couleurs standard (nephele).
Tracker
Tracker est l’explorateur de fichiers. Le code du Tracker contient également les fenêtres « ouvrir » et « enregistrer sous », mises à disposition des autres applications sous forme de la bibliothèque libtracker.so.
Envoi de la notification d’activation de l’espace de travail à tous les réplicants, afin que ces derniers puissent ajuster leur couleur (par exemple) en fonction de l’espace de travail actif (jscipione).
Correction du positionnement du champ de texte lors du renommage de fichiers dans la vue par icônes, résolution de problèmes de gestion de l’état des fenêtres après un glisser-déposer avorté, affichage des volumes disque en premier (avant les dossiers) si l’option « trier les dossiers en premier » est active, synchronisation en direct des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers lors du changement d’options, et divers nettoyages de code (jscipione).
Ajout d’une bordure manquante dans les fenêtres de sélection de fichiers (nipos).
Ajout du nombre d’élément sélectionnés (en plus du nombre d’éléments total du dossier) dans les fenêtres du Tracker (nathan242).
Correction d’un problème de concurrence dans le constructeur des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers, dont la conséquence était une mauvaise disposition des contrôles dans la fenêtre (certains boutons apparaissant superposés par exemple (PulkoMandy).
Amélioration de l’image d’aperçu qui suit la souris lors d’un glisser-déplacer lorsqu’on déplace beaucoup de fichiers: l’image est tronquée pour ne pas être trop grande mais le dégradé de transparence sur les bords n’était pas bien calculé (PulkoMandy).
Déclenchement automatique du « renifleur » de type MIME, qui identifie automatiquement les fichiers pour les afficher avec la bonne icône par exemple. En particulier cela rend l’utilisation du Tracker plus confortable sur les systèmes de fichiers ne permettant pas de stocker le type MIME dans un attribut étendu (Jim906).
Correction d’une régression sur la mise à jour en direct des tailles et dates de modification de fichiers dans les résultats de requêtes (waddlesplash).
MediaPlayer
MediaPlayer est une application pour lire des fichiers média (son et vidéo).
Correction de la couleur du texte dans la fenêtre d’informations (nephele).
Dans cette même fenêtre, le champ indiquant le chemin du fichier en cours de lecture est maintenant cliquable (nathan242, dont c’est la première contribution).
Ajout d’une détection automatique du type MIME des fichiers, s’il n’est pas renseigné (par exemple s’il est stocké sur un système de fichiers où il n’y a pas d’attributs étendus) (DigitalBox98).
Sudoku
Sudoku est un jeu de Sudoku, très utile pour patienter pendant une compilation un peu longue.
Amélioration de la palette de couleurs en mode clair (le mode sombre nécessite encore du travail) (axeld).
DeskBar
DeskBar est la barre des tâches de BeOS et de Haiku. La même application contient également le code pour la fenêtre de changement de tâches « Twitcher ».
Correction d’un bug qui faisait apparaître des applications en double dans le « Twitcher » (la fenêtre de changement rapide d’application qui apparaît avec le raccourci Alt+Tab) (madmax).
People
People est un gestionnaire de contacts. Il stocke les contacts dans des fichiers « person » avec les informations sous forme d’attributs étendus.
Correction du défilement avec la molette de la souris ou au touchpad (nipos).
Lecteur MIDI
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
MidiPlayer
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
Changement de la couleur du contrôle de volume qui était codée en dur, non configurable et pas harmonisée avec le reste du système (nipos).
ProcessController
ProcessController affiche la charge CPU et l’occupation mémoire dans la DeskBar. Il permet également d’afficher des statistiques par application, et de débugger et stopper des applications via un menu popup.
Ajustements pour les écrans haute densité : taille des menus, largeur par défaut de l’icône réplicant, autorisation du redimensionnement de la fenêtre principale (la taille est conservée si on installe ensuite un réplicant sur le bureau, et divers autres changements (waddlesplash).
Installer
Installer permet de cloner l’installation de Haiku actuelle vers un autre disque.
Ajout d’un outil pour copier automatiquement le chargeur de démarrage sur la partition EFI du système, pour réduire le nombre d’étapes manuelles pour installer Haiku correctement sur un système EFI (PawanYr, avec des améliorations de kallisti5 pour nommer le fichier installé correctement en fonction de l’architecture CPU du système).
Amélioration du calcul de la taille de la fenêtre « EULA » de l’installeur (qui affiche non pas un contrat de license, mais un message de bienvenue et quelques instructions pour l’installation), en fonction de la taille de texte sélectionnée dans les préférences (nipos).
Mail
L'application Mail permet de lire et de rédiger des e-mail. Elle fonctionne en collaboration avec le mail_server qui s’occupe de l’envoi et de la réception des messages.
Correction d’une régression sur la couleur de fond des champs d’adresse. Mise en place des mises à jour de couleurs automatiques. Les champs désactivés ou en lecture seule sont maintenant « navigables » (avec la touche tab) et le texte peut être sélectionné et copié (jscipione).
Les boutons « suivant » et « précédent » peuvent être accompagnés de la touche Maj. (Shift), pour changer de message sans modifier le statut « lu » des messages (humdinger).
DriveSetup
DriveSetup permet de configurer les supports de stockage: formatage, partitionnement.
L’application s’affiche sur tous les espaces de travail si la DeskBar n’est pas lancée. Ce cas particulier est utile lors du lancement de l’installation de Haiku, dans ce cas, le bureau n’est pas lancé, mais il est tout de même possible d’utiliser plusieurs espaces de travail, ce qui peut donner l’impression que les fenêtres ont disparu si on se retrouve sur un espace vide (PulkoMandy).
Finalisation d’un patch datant d’il y a plusieurs années pour ajouter un menu permettant d’écrire ou de lire des images disques depuis ou vers des partitions (plus besoin d’utiliser dd en ligne de commande) (sed4096, avec l’aide d’humdinger pour des améliorations de localisation et de choix de vocabulaire).
Debugger
Debugger permet de débugger les logiciels fonctionnant dans Haiku.
Correction d’un crash lorsqu’on essaie de débugger des applications trop grosses, par exemples celle utilisant Mesa et llvmpipe pour faire du rendu 3D (waddlesplash).
Changements transverses
Modification de toutes les chaînes de caractères où le nom d’une application est présent (par exemple : « Deskbar preferences »). En effet, le nom des applications peut optionnellement être traduit, et toutes ces chaînes doivent donc s’adapter dans les deux cas (nom d’application traduit ou conservé en anglais selon les préférences de l’utilisateur). Auparavant ce réglage ne pouvait pas être appliqué de façon systématique (humdinger).
Fenêtres de préférences
Réseau
Affichage de l’état précis des interfaces réseau (en cours de configuration DHCP, par exemple) et pas seulement « hors ligne » ou « en ligne » (nipos).
Périphériques d’entrée
Ajout et amélioration de plusieurs options pour la gestion des touchpad (samuelrp84). Voir plus bas les informations sur la réécriture du pilote Elantech qui donne plus de détails.
Apparence
Envoi d’un seul message de mise à jour aux applications lorsque plusieurs couleurs changent simultanément, ce qui est plus efficace et réduit les « clignotements » d’applications dans certains cas (nephele).
Correction de la hauteur des fausses barres de défilement visibles dans la fenêtre d’apparence pour configurer les barres de défilement (jscipione).
Outils en ligne de commande
Le réplicant NetworkStatus peut être installé dans la DeskBar via la ligne de commande même lorsque une fenêtre de NetworkStatus est déjà ouverte (nipos).
Ajout dans strace de l’affichage des structures stat, sockopt, sigset_t, sigprocmask et des noms de signaux (korli avec un correctif par nathan242).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans l’interface en ligne de commande du Debugger, qui conduisaient entre autres à un gel de l’application. Cette interface est surtout utilisée en cas de crash d’un service critique (app_server, registrar, input_server) qui empêcherait l’utilisation de l’interface graphique. Les investigations sur ces services en cas de crash sont donc facilitées.
Modification de bfs_tools pour rendre ces outils compilables sur le système hôte utilisé pour compiler Haiku (axeld). Ces outils permettent de manipuler à la main un système de fichiers bfs, de récupérer certaines données sur un disque corrompu, et diverses manipulations de bas niveau.
Modification de l’outil makebootable pour vérifier que la partition à rendre bootable est bien une partition BFS. Utiliser l’outil sur une partition d’un autre format ou sur un disque complet pourrait corrompre le système de fichier et rendre les données inaccessibles. Ajout d’un message indiquant lorsque le lancement de makebootable n’est pas nécessaire, car les utilisateurs continuent de recommander de lancer cet outil sans aucune raison pour corriger des problèmes de démarrage (encourageant ainsi les nouveaux utilisateurs à faire dea mauvaises manipulations et à corrompre leur système de fichiers) (PulkoMandy).
Suppression d’une verrue dans checkfs qui n’est plus nécessaire suite à des améliorations du Storage Kit. Cela permet de lancer checkfs pour vérifier une partition en donnant le chemin de n’importe quel fichier contenu dans la partition (waddlesplash).
Activation du support de l’IPv6 dans telnet, implémentation dans netstat (avec des corrections sur les opérateurs de filtrage), et ajout de traceroute6 compilé à partir des sources fournies par NetBSD (cmeerw).
Amélioration de l’affichage de df avec plus d’informations, un listage sur deux lignes, et l’ajout d’une option pour afficher les informations standardisées dans le format imposé par POSIX (nipos et PulkoMandy).
Kits
Interface
L'interface kit se charge de tout l’affichage de fenêtres à l’écran et des contrôles de base (boutons, cases à cocher…)
Correction d’un bug dans le contrôle calendrier lors du déplacement vers les mois suivant ou précédent (nipos).
Correction d’un problème de navigation au clavier dans une ListView après l’insertion de nouveaux objets (nipos).
BControl (la classe parente de tous les contrôles d’interface graphique) ne change plus ses couleurs dans la fonction AttachedToWindow(). Ce n’est plus nécessaire après d’autres changements dans BButton, et cela simplifie le code nécessaire pour personnaliser la couleur d’un contrôle spécifique (pour avoir, par exemple, un bouton rouge) (jscipione).
Améliorations sur BSlider: correction de la couleur du texte, nettoyage du code de dessin des sliders dans les implémentations de ControlLook (jscipione).
Augmentation de la taille des marques sur les boutons des barres de défilement (marques qui ne sont pas activées à moins de modifier manuellement un fichier de configuration) pour les rendre plus visibles sur les hautes résolutions (jscipione).
Les infobulles utilisent un espacement calculé en fonction de la taille du texte, pour une apparence plus jolie sur les écrans à haute densité (waddlesplash).
Séparation du titre des onglets et du nom des vues qui leurs sont attachées. Le comportement original est hérité de BeOS, il est donc préservé pour les anciennes applications. Mais pour les nouvelles applications, le nom interne des vues ne doit pas être traduit (il peut être utilisé par des scripts ou par le code de l’application), tandis que le titre affiché à l’utilisateur doit l’être. C’était le seul endroit où ce principe de séparation du nom et du texte affiché n’était pas respecté (KapiX et PulkoMandy).
Dans BTextView, la fonction « tout sélectionner » déplace le curseur à la fin de la sélection (et à la fin du texte). C’est le comportement de la plupart des autres systèmes, et préserver la position du curseur dans ce cas ne semble pas particulièrement utile (OscarL).
Correction de problèmes de choix de couleurs dans le code qui dessine des sliders avec un curseur triangulaire (nipos). Cette correction a permis d’utiliser ce type de slider dans les fenêtres de réglages de différents traducteurs d’images.
Amélioration de l’apparence des cases à cocher partiellement cochées. Elles s’affichent avec un signe "-" au lieu d’une croix. Auparavant, la couleur était subtilement modifiée mais ce n’était pas très visible (PulkoMandy).
Implémentation de la lecture d’un son dans BAlert, qui peut être activé dans les préférences de son (sed4096).
Storage
Le storage kit permet de contrôler les disques et supports de stockage (liste des partitions, montage et démontage, accès aux fichiers, chemins d’accès, requêtes…)
BPartition retourne une erreur B_BUSY si on essaie de monter une partition qui est déjà montée à un autre endroit, au lieu de la monter une deuxième fois (jscipione).
Device
Le device kit permet l’interaction directe avec certains périphériques (USB, série, joysticks…) directement depuis l’espace utilisateur.
Correction de problèmes de gestion de la mémoire dans BUSBInterface mis en évidence par AtomoZero lors d’expérimentations pour corriger le pilote de webcam à l’aide d’un LLM (waddlesplash).
Package
Le package kit se charge de la résolution des dépendances entre paquets et du téléchargement des paquets à installer. Il fonctionne en collaboration avec le système de fichier packagefs qui permet d’accéder au contenu des paquets une fois installés.
Retravail de BRepositoryCache pour remonter les informations sur les paquets via un callback plutôt que de remplir une structure BPackageInfoSet. Cela économise beaucoup de mémoire et d’allocations mémoire, et rend donc la lecture des dépôts de paquets plus rapide (waddlesplash).
Serveurs
Notifications
Le serveur de notifications permet d’afficher des notifications pour les évènements importants.
Les notifications déjà affichées changent de position immédiatement lorsque la configuration est modifiée pour les déplacer (nipos).
Ajout de la lecture de l’effet sonore choisi dans les préférences de son lors de l’apparition des différents types de notification, et à chaque pourcent de progression pour les notifications contenant une barre de progression (sed4096).
Choix de couleurs plus visibles en mode sombre pour les icônes de fermeture et de repli des notifications en mode sombre (nipos).
Network
Le serveur de réseau se charge de la configuration des interfaces réseau, de la configuration des routes et d’autres aspects liés à la communication en réseau.
Refonte du client DHCP dans net_server pour l’exécuter dans un thread séparé et ne pas bloquer la boucle de messages principale. Cela corrige plusieurs cas de gel du serveur lui-même et d’application qui communiquent avec de façon synchrone, par exemple les préférences de réseau. Cela permet également de plus facilement arrêter les requêtes DHCP lorsqu’une interface est reconfigurée avec une adresse statique (waddlesplash).
app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique gérant l’affichage à l’écran.
Correction de crashs causés par des verrous de concurrence manquants et des opérations effectuées dans le mauvais ordre (waddlesplash).
Retrait d’identifiants de messages qui n’étaient plus utilisés dans le protocole de communication entre les applications et le serveur graphique (X512).
Ajout du code nécessaire pour le tracé de lignes avec un dégradé de couleur (dans app_server et dans BView). Auparavant, les dégradés étaient utilisables uniquement pour le remplissage des formes et pas pour les contours (x512).
Modifications de BPicturePlayer pour utiliser une classe C++ avec de l’héritage plutôt qu’une structure C contenant des pointeurs de fonctions. Cela permet de vérifier que l’interface est implémentée correctement par les différents utilisateurs de cette classe dès la compilation (X512).
Implémentation de méthodes manquantes dans BoundingBox player, une implémentation de BPicturePlayer qui calcule un rectangle assez grand pour contenir tout le dessin réalisé par un objet BPicture rejoué via BPicturePlayer (KapiX).
Retrait d’une optimisation incorrecte dans le traitement des calques avec une opacité globale de 100% dans app_server. Ces calques peuvent tout de même contenir des pixels avec de la transparence, et doivent donc être applatis en tenant compte du canal alpha comme tous les autres calques (KapiX).
Modification du protocole app_server pour l’opération permettant de récupérer les « bounding boxes » pour chaque caractère d’une chaîne. L’interface précédente utilisait un tableau de structures, la nouvelle API est inversée ce qui permet d’envoyer plus efficacement 2 tableaux de types primitifs (X512).
Pilotes de périphériques
Implémentation correcte des timeouts sur les commandes dans le pilote SDHCI, ce qui corrige la compatibilité avec plusieurs lecteurs de cartes SD (PulkoMandy).
Réécriture complète du pilote pour les touchpads Elantech. Cette série de changements retouche tout d’abord la gestion des touchpads en général, avec des améliorations sur la documentation, sur le traitement des données invalides, la configuration par défaut, et un nettoyage du code.
Ensuite, le code pour la reconnaissance de « gestures » a été amélioré pour mieux reconnaître plusieurs mouvements tels que le « tap » pour cliquer, le défilement en faisant glsser 2 doigts sur le touchpad, etc. Les préférences du touchpad ont reçu plusieurs nouvelles cases à cocher pour configurer ces différentes options.
Enfin, la dernière partie du patch met à jour le pilote Elantech pour reconnaître les 4 versions du protocole, dont la dernière est entièrement testée. La version 2 ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant (elle a été désactivée pour l’instant) et les versions 1 et 3 sont activées de façon expérimentale dans les nightly builds en attendant les retours d’utilisateurs (samuelrp84).
Normalisation des noms de volumes générés par le pilote usb_disk pour s’assurer qu’ils ne commencent pas par des espaces (madmax).
Mise à jour de la couche de compatibilité FreeBSD avec FreeBSD 15 et synchronisation de tous les pilotes réseau (ethernet et wifi) concernés avec ceux de FreeBSD 15. Synchronisation du pilote rtl8125 avec OpenBSD (waddlesplash).
Ajout de « quirks » et de code supplémentaire dans le pilote I2C-HID pour essayer de se rapprocher du comportement implémenté dans Linux. Ce pilote ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant et il est désactivé par défaut (Lt-Henry).
Systèmes de fichiers
Ajout d’un bouchon supplémentaire pour une API qui n’a pas besoin d’être implémentée dans userlandfs-FUSE (qui permet l’utilisation de systèmes de fichiers FUSE sous Haiku). Cette modification permet d’utiliser en particulier le système de fichier squashfs-fuse pour accéder à des volumes squashfs (OscarL).
Toujours dans userlandfs-fuse, propagation de l’état « lecture seule » du système de fichier, ce qui permet au Tracker de clairement afficher ces systèmes de fichiers comme étant en lecture seule (fond de fenêtre grisé, désactivation des opérations modifiant les fichiers) (OscarL).
Dans le système de fichiers UDF, amélioration des messages de logs, et correction d’un kernel panic déclenché par une assertion suite à des modifications précédentes dans le VFS (waddlesplash).
Correction d’un double lock dans le pilote FAT qui pouvait déclencher un kernel panic dans de rare cas (Jim906).
Intégration d’une partie des patchs permettant de redimensionner une partition BFS. Ce travail avait été commencé en 2014 dans le cadre du Google Summer of Code mais n’avait pas pu être terminé dans les temps. La série de patch est restée à l’abandon pendant de longues années, mais elle est en train d’être finalisée pour pouvoir en intégrer au moins une première partie (axeld).
Correction d’un bug sur la gestion des timestamps avec un nombre de secondes entier pour BFS. Historiquement dans BeOS, il n’existait pas d’API POSIX pour stocker une date de modification avec une résolution plus fine qu’une seconde. Cela conduisait de très nombreux fichiers à avoir le poids faible de leur date de modification à 0, avec pour conséquence une dégradation de la répartition dans les tables de hachage pour l’exécution de requêtes. Dans ce cas, BFS stocke une valeur aléatoire générée en interne par le système de fichier dans les bits de poids faible. Le bug était que cette valeur pouvait être exposée à l’espace utilisateur, entraînant de mauvais résultats sur la gestion des comparaisons de dates (par exemple pour déterminer les règles à lancer dans un makefile). La représentation interne a été légèrement modifiée pour bien distinguer les fichiers pour lesquels une date précise a été enregistrée, de ceux pour lesquels il s’agit de bits aléatoires. Ces derniers peuvent ainsi être filtrés et masqués pour l’espace utilisateur (PulkoMandy).
Correction de la gestion des dossiers déjà existants dans write_overlay. Ils'agit d’un système de fichier qui permet de stocker en RAM des écritures temporaires sur un système de fichier monté en lecture seule, utilisé en particulier pour l’exécution en mode live CD (nathan242).
Le pilote BTRFS ne déclenche plus un kernel panic lorsqu’il rencontre un type de compression inconnu, à la place, il retourne simplement une erreur et considère que le fichier ou dossier concerné ne peut pas être lu (AbdullahZulfiqar2005).
Des changements sur les requêtes (pour BFS et les autres systèmes de fichiers capables d’exécuter des requêtes): une petite optimisation du code, une modification pour ne pas notifier les suppressions de nœuds via B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL car elles sont déjà notifiées par d’autres moyens. L’API B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL est maintenant considérée comme stable, et a donc été ajoutée dans la documentation officielle (waddlesplash).
libroot &amp; kernel
Réseau
Implémentation des sockets du domaine UNIX de type SOCK_SEQPACKET. Pour ce faire, modifications de recv et send pour accepter des buffers de taille 0 (pour les socket de type datagramme, pas les streams). Implémentation de MSG_TRUNC et MSG_PEEK pour les sockets du domaine UNIX, et amélioration de la gestion des adresses invalides dans accept et recv pour se rapprocher du comportement de Linux et des BSD (korli).
Implémentation de la découverte de MTU de chemin complet pour TCP et IPv4 (waddlesplash) et IPv6 (cmeerw). L’algorithme mis en place est simpliste, mais permet d’établir des communications dans des cas où le MTU est limité et la fragmentation de paquets n’est pas mise en place.
Nettoyage des buffers mémoire utilisés pour stocker des adresses dans le code de gestion du réseau. Cela corrige un comportement incorrect dans le cas où une adresse de socket UNIX n’est pas terminée par un caractère NUL (cas qui est explicitement autorisé sous Linux car l’information de longueur de l’adresse est disponible par ailleurs) (Anarchos pour la correction du cas où la vérification était oubliée, suivi d’un nettoyage par waddlesplash pour avoir une solution plus systématique à tous les endroits où ce cas particulier doit être pris en compte).
Un socket TCP qui est fermé alors que des données sont reçues par le noyau mais pas encore lues par l’application associée renvoie un paquet RST plutôt qu’un FIN. Ceci corrige un problème détecté dans les tests du langage Go. Modification du comportement lors de la réception d’un reset pendant la fermeture d’un socket TCP pour se comporter comme les autres systèmes (korli).
Déplacement du fichier networks utiliser par getnetent dans le dossier data, avec les autres fichiers de configuration du réseau. Il était placé par erreur dans /etc, qui est son chemin habituel pour d’autres systèmes UNIX (PulkoMandy).
Report d’une correction faite par NetBSD dans le résolveur DNS, il manquait une partie de l’initialisation de certains objets dans l’état du résolveur (cmeerw).
Gestion de l’IPv6: correction d’un problème dans la mise à jour du cache pour le protocole NDP (neighbor discovery), implémentation du multicast (cmeerw).
Remplacement des fonctions inet_net_ntop et inet_net_pton par l’implémentation d’OpenBSD, qui est plus respectueuse du standard que celle de NetBSD utilisée auparavant (korli).
Gestion des processus
Autorisation de l’appel de exec() depuis un autre thread que le thread principal du processus, pour se mettre en conformité avec POSIX et corriger un problème avec les outils de compilation d’OCaml (korli).
Préservation des signaux masqués lors de l’appel à fork (korli).
Mise en conformité POSIX des codes d’erreurs retournés dans certains cas dans la gestion des groupes de processus (waddlesplash).
Librairie C standard
Mise en conformité POSIX-2024:
Ajout des fonctions ffsl et ffsll dans strings.h (korli)
Ajout de getresuid(), setresuid(), getresgid(), setresgid() (korli)
Ajout de la déclaration de posix_spawn_file_actions_add[f]chdir dans les en-têtes publics (la fonction était déjà implémentée mais pas déclarée) (waddlesplash)
Synchronisation de l’implémentation de arc4random avec la dernière version d’OpenBSD (korli).
Correction d’un bug dans la gestion des locales, il n’était pas possible de changer seulement certaines catégories (date, format monétaire, messages), tout était forcément dans la même langue (waddlesplash).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans la famille de fonctions strftime (waddlesplash):
ajout des formats %k et %l,
correction sur la gestion des caractères d'espacement Unicode,
correction de problèmes sur la gestion des fuseaux horaires.
Correction de problèmes mineur de compatibilité POSIX: ajout de déclarations de fonctions et de constantes dans search.h, unistd.h, semaphore.h, nettoyage dans limits.h, définition de getlocalename_l… (waddlesplash).
Remplacement de strtok_r par l’implémentation de musl (waddlesplash).
Refonte du stockage et de la gestion des données ctype pour rendre le code plus facile à maintenir, supprimer des indirections inutiles et corriger un problème de thread safety (waddlesplash).
Nettoyage des fonctions de conversions d’encodage de caractères, et correction de la valeur de MB_CUR_MAX pour l’encodage UTF-8 (waddlesplash).
Définition de la constante DEV_BSIZE (mentionnée dans POSIX mais pas obligatoire) dans sys/param.h, modification de tous le code utilisant stat.st_blocks pour utiliser cette constante, y compris des problèmes dans certains systèmes de fichiers qui utilisaient st_blksize à la place. En effet, il n’y a aucun rapport entre la taille de bloc de st_blksize et le nombre de blocs de st_blocks défini juste à côté (waddlesplash).
Gestion de la mémoire
Correction d’une régression du mois précédent sur la gestion des réservations de mémoire lors du découpage d’areas`. Ajout de la possibilité de transférer des réservations de pages pour les caches et areas réservés, pour éviter de réduire les réservations de façon incorrecte. Cela pouvait causer des assertions et des plantages du noyau en particulier lors de l’exécution d’applications utilisant AddressSanitizer (waddlesplash).
Correction d’une fuite de mémoire dans… la gestion de la mémoire, mis en évidence entre autres par l’exécution du compilateur Rust qui consomme beaucoup de mémoire. Au passage, nettoyage du code et des messages de logs dans cette partie du code (waddlesplash).
Entrées-sorties
Modification de la gestion des requêtes d’entrées-sortie pour autoriser les pilotes de périphériques à sous-classer IORequestOwner. En particulier, cela permet au pilote NVMe d’utiliser ces fonctionnalités sans passer par l’ordonnanceur d’I/O générique qui ne se prête pas bien à l’interfaçage de matériel pouvant traiter plusieurs requêtes en parallèle. Cela permet de simplifier du code, supprimer une fonction récursive devenue inutile et finalement corriger un débordement de pile (waddlesplash).
La taille des partitions indiquée dans le bootloader n’était pas correcte : c’était la taille du disque entier qui était affichée à la place (waddlesplash).
Chargeur de démarrage
Correction de l’affichage de caractères unicode dans le menu de démarrage. En particulier cela évite de corrompre l’affichage lors de la navigation dans le système de fichiers pour désactiver certains pilotes de périphériques. Le firmware UEFI utilise de l’UTF16, tandis que le BIOS utilise une page de code IBM non standardisée. Le bootloader utilise en interne de l’UTF-8 et doit donc convertir les caractères dans le bon format dans chaque cas (madmax).
Implémentation du démarrage via le réseau sur les plateformes EFI (avec un peu de nettoyage sur le support réseau dans OpenFirmware et PXE). Cela fonctionne au moins sur l’architecture ARM 32-bit et facilite le développement sur cible réelle: compilation sur une machine, et exécution sur une autre sans devoir entretemps copier le système de fichiers et le bootloader sur une clé USB ou une carte SD (kallisti5 et PulkoMandy).
Un des en-têtes du bootloader utilisait une syntaxe C++, il a été corrigé pour pouvoir être importé depuis du code C si nécessaire (beaglejoe).
Le chargeur EFI ignore les disques qui ont une taille de bloc de 0 octet, ce qui évite une division par zéro lors de tentatives de lire des données (archeYR).
Systèmes de fichiers
Le noyau interdit maintenant de monter plusieurs fois la même partition. Cette vérification avait d’abord été implémentée dans le pilote FAT, puis via une vérification en espace utilisateur, mais ces deux protections étaient insuffisantes et causaient d’autres problèmes (waddlesplash).
Centralisation de plusieurs vérifications au niveau du VFS, par exemple les vérifications de type fichier ou dossier, les modes d’ouverture des fichiers, des codes d’erreurs retournés pour certaines erreurs spécifiques. Ces changements évitent d’avoir des différences de comportement entre différents systèmes de fichiers et s’assurent que le comportement implémenté est bien celui spécifié par POSIX (waddlesplash).
Implémentation de « fallbacks » pour les systèmes de fichiers qui ne savent pas traiter eux-mêmes les opérations SEEK_DATA, SEEK_HOLE et select(), dont en particulier le write_overlay. Cela permet à la commande cp de fonctionner correctement dans ce cas (nathan242).
Outils de debug
Remise en commun de code pour la gestion du MMU dans le chargeur de démarrage EFI. Le code avait été dupliqué pour chaque architecture de CPU supportés, mais il est en fait en très grande partie identique. Regrouper ce code permet de s’assurer que les évolutions sont bien faites de façon synchronisée pour toutes les architectures (PulkoMandy).
Affichage dans le message de kernel panic de la version de Haiku (numéro hrev). Ceci évite de devoir demander ce numéro aux utilisateurs remontant un bug, il est directement inclus dans la capture d’écran de l’erreur (nathan242).
Modification de la valeur retournée par kernel_version dans les informations système. La valeur retournée par Haiku était la version majeure, qui est 1 depuis le début du projet Haiku en 2001. Elle retourne maintenant une version plus complète qui peut être utilisée dans la commande uname pour indiquer la version de Haiku plus précisément (waddlesplash).
Désactivation de la fonction spécifique à BeOS exect sur les architectures qui n’implémentent pas de compatibilité binaire avec BeOS.
Build system
Ajout d’une macro _DEPRECATED dans les en-têtes de base du système, permettant d’indiquer les classes, méthodes et fonctions qui sont obsolètes et à ne plus utiliser. Cela permet d’avoir un avertissement du compilateur lors de leur utilisation dans le code existant, et de commencer à mettre à jour le code, mais sans casser le code déjà écrit pour l’instant. Actuellement, cette macro n’est pas utilisée, des discussions sont encore en cours sur l’opportunité de retirer certaines APIs.
Remise en état des tests pour le bootloader. Ces tests permettent de lancer une partie du bootloader (dont le menu de configuration) sous forme d’un programme s’exécutant sous Haiku. Cela permet de tester une grande partie du code du bootloader sans avoir besoin de redémarrer le système (waddlesplash).
Ajout d’un script pour convertir une disposition de clavier de la console Linux dans le format reconnu par Haiku (mmu_man).
Mise à jour de paquets pour réparer la compilation en mode « bootstrap » (sans dépendances précompilées) pour ARM et ARM64 (PulkoMandy).
Nettoyage et amélioration de la classe utilitaire FunctionTracer qui permet d’afficher facilement une trace de l’exécution de fonctions, avec une indentation indiquant les appels imbriqués. Il existait plusieurs versions de cette classe utilisées à différents endroits dans le code, chacune avec de légères variations. Renommage de fonctions qui pouvaient entrer en conflit avec l’utilisation de debug_printf et modification de cette dernière pour retourner le nombre de caractères imprimés afin de pouvoir l’utiliser de façon interchangeable avec les autres fonctions de la famille printf (PulkoMandy).
Déplacement de plusieurs en-têtes initialement développés pour une utilisation dans le noyau, de headers/private/kernel/util vers headers/private/util, en effet ils implémentent des fonctionnalités assez génériques (listes chaînées, hash tables, opérations sur les bits…) et sont tout à fait utilisables en dehors du noyau (c’est d’ailleurs déjà le cas à plusieurs endroits dans le code de Haiku) (PulkoMandy et waddlesplash).
Retrait de cas ou l’activation de DEBUG=1 (compilation en mode debug avec des assertions supplémentaires) était empêchée pour certains composants du code (waddlesplash).
Modification du code pour inclure les catalogues de traductions automatiquement dans le paquet contenant l’exécutable correspondant. Ce code incluait également les catalogues de toutes les dépendances, ce qui conduisait les catalogues système de libbe.so à être présents plusieurs fois dans plusieurs paquets, occupant inutilement de la place). Ce changement n’est pas tout à fait terminé puisque maintenant certains catalogues ne sont plus inclus du tout (PulkoMandy).
Modernisation de la page d’accueil de WebPositive pour en permettre l’utilisation avec d’autres navigateurs: définition du bon type MIME, utilisation de HTTPS pour télécharger des ressources externes, déclaration de l’encodage du fichier (humbinger).
Modification du « Makefile Engine » pour autoriser des flags de compilation différents entre les fichiers sources C et C++, ce qui permet d’éviter des warnings de compilation dans certains projets compilant des sources C (OscarL).
Il est maintenant possible de compiler Haiku depuis NetBSD (cmeerw).
Réparation de la compilation de test_app_server (KapiX).
Utilisation de la constante B_DEV_NAME_LENGTH plutôt que de la valeur numérique 128 à plusieurs endroits dans le code (jscipione et OscarL).
Suppression de la dépendance du build à la commande bc, en utilisant à la place des expressions arithmétiques du shell POSIX (PulkoMandy).
Réparation de la compilation des tests unitaires, modification des tests utilisant l’interface graphique pour les exécuter avec test_app_server, ajout d’un package haiku_unittests et d’un profil de build qui inclut ce package dans le système de fichier compilé. L’objectif est de pouvoir lancer ces tests automatiquement dans le cadre de l’intégration continue de Haiku (KapiX, à partir d’un travail plus ancien démarré par kallisti5).
Mise à jour de l’année de copyright à 2026 dans le menu de démarrage et dans les métadonnées des paquets générés par Haiku (PulkoMandy).
Mise à jour des paquets précompilés utilisés pour compiler Haiku avec les dernières versions fournies par HaikuPorts pour les architectures x86 et x86_64. L’outil utilisé pour faire cette synchronisation a reçu lui-même quelques évolutions. Le code de Haiku a été légèrement ajusté pour corriger les problèmes de compilation avec ces nouvelles versions des dépendances (waddlesplash, avec l’aide de madmax pour corriger des problèmes de compilation sur RISC-V qui utilise pour l’instant une version plus ancienne de certains paquets).

Changement de tarification de Netlify
Netlify héberge le site www.haiku-os.org. Ils ont récemment modifié leur tarification pour ajouter un système de crédit en fonction de la bande passante consommée. Haiku bénéficie de l’offre « Open Source », avec une certaine quantité de trafic offerte (en échange de l’affichage d’un logo de Netlify en base de page du site). Cette offre s’est révélée insuffisante dans la nouvelle tarification, surtout suite à une attaque de robots (probablement pour l’entraînement de LLM de mauvaise qualité, puisque ils requêtaient des pages n’existant pas et n’obtenaient que des erreurs 404). Du côté de Haiku, des protections ont été mises en place pour éviter ce genre de problème, mais entretemps, Netlify a facturé le dépassement de bande passante autorisée pour le mois de décembre.
Finalement, après une discussion avec l’équipe de support de Netlify et une vérification de ce qu’il s’était passé, la facture a été annulée, et la consommation de bande passante pour Haiku a été augmentée pour mieux convenir à l’utilisation habituelle générée par Haiku.
Remise sur les rails de HSA (Haiku Support Association)
Actuellement, l’association Haiku inc est la principale organisation recevant des dons et finançant les activités de Haiku (développeur employé, coût d’hébergement de l’infrastructure…).
Cette association est basée aux USA, ce qui est récemment devenu une source d’inquiétude pour certains contributeurs et donateurs de Haiku.
Suite à une discussion sur les forums, il y a donc un regain d’intérêt pour la Haiku Support Association, une autre organisation basée en Allemagne et qui était dormante depuis plusieurs années. Plusieurs personnes ont donc adhéré à cette association et cela va peut-être permettre d’en relancer l’activité et d’assurer une présence en Europe.
En particulier, c’est cette association qui organisait la conférence BeGeistert et le traditionnel « coding sprint » associé, permettant aux développeurs et aux utilisateurs de Haiku de se rencontrer régulièrement. Cette activité avait cessé suite au manque de public pour ces évènements, à une perte d’intérêt des membres de l’association, et une absence de nouveaux adhérents pour relancer les choses. Espérons que cette période d’inactivité soit maintenant terminée et que l’organisation de conférences plus régulières puisse reprendre.

Quand un développeur demande à Claude ou ChatGPT d’écrire du code, l’IA pioche dans des milliers de bibliothèques libres sans que l’humain ne lise jamais leur documentation. Résultat: les mainteneurs de ces projets open-source, qui vivent de la visibilité générée par les visites et les interactions, voient leur audience s’effondrer. Une étude économique chiffre ce paradoxe: l’IA qui accélère le développement logiciel asphyxie l’écosystème qui le rend possible.

### 6. `FR` [L’ANSSI révise sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre](data/articles/8a512e5cc7bbd13459cb5362176c6f21.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) vient de publier une mise à jour substantielle de sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre. L’agence confirme que le logiciel libre et la transparence sont essentiels à la sécurité des systèmes d’information. Elle assume sa contribution au libre et la publication de logiciels sous licence libre.
Cette posture très favorable au logiciel libre et open source est une belle avancée et un signal fort. Jusque-là, la posture de l’ANSSI était beaucoup plus floue et sa contribution à des projets libres et open source pouvait même apparaitre en contradiction avec sa doctrine. J’avais l’impression que les collaborateurs de l’ANSSI qui le faisaient reprenaient à leur compte le dicton « Pour vivre heureux, vivons cachés ».
La politique de l’agence est désormais claire : l’ANSSI contribue, l’ANSSI publie, l’ANSSI a une stratégie pragmatique qui peut l’amener à s’engager ou non sur le long terme en fonction de la finalité de l’outil et des motivations de l’ANSSI.
Détail qui a son importance, l’ANSSI indique privilégier, sauf exception justifiée, la licence Apache v2.0 pour les projets qu’elle publie. Je suis ravi de voir ce service privilégier une licence mondialement connue à une licence franco-française ou européenne (elles ont le don de doucher nombre de velléités d’utilisation et de contribution). lien nᵒ 1 : L’ANSSI met à jour sa politique open source (9 février 2026)

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’association Drupal France &amp; Francophonie organise la 13ème édition du Drupalcamp les 9, 10 et 11 avril 2026 au campus Universitaire Grenoble Alpes de Grenoble (France, Isère 38). Drupal est « un système de gestion de contenu (CMS) libre et open-source publié sous la licence publique générale GNU et écrit en PHP ».
Après Rennes en 2024, puis un Barcamp à Perpignan en 2025, cette année 2026 nous emmène au pied des montagnes à Grenoble pour un format de 3 jours de rencontres, soit deux journées de conférences les jeudi et vendredi. La journée du samedi est réservée à la contribution.
Des moments d’ateliers et micro-formation sont également au programme, pour faire de cet évènement une réussite d’un point de vue communauté autour du projet Open Source Drupal.
Le Drupalcamp Grenoble c’est la rencontre de la communauté francophone autour du logiciel libre Drupal. Ouvert à toutes et tous, les rencontres, conférences et ateliers permettent d’adresser à un public toujours plus large des sujets et thématiques diversifiées.
Notre objectif principal est de rendre la création de sites plus simple et la gestion des contenus plus intuitive pour tous. Comme de fédérer les utilisateurs et professionnels qui utilisent Drupal au quotidien.
Du simple curieux au développeur expert, tous ceux qui s’intéressent à Drupal et aux logiciels libres pourront participer à cette manifestation rythmée par :
des conférences (jeudi 9 et vendredi 10 avril), données par des professionnels reconnus et des membres de la communauté Drupal au cours desquels des thématiques nouvelles seront explorées,
des sessions de découverte étayées par des démonstrations à l’intention d’un public plus néophyte,
une journée de formation gratuite (Drupal in a Day) dédiée à l’initiation pour que les curieux puissent se lancer dans la création de leur premier site (sur inscription)
des moments de réseautage et de convivialité avec, notamment, la très attendue soirée communautaire !

Utilisateur de Canoprof depuis 2019, cet outil est devenu un des piliers de ma pratique d’enseignement en Physique-Chimie (4ᵉ, 5ᵉ, 3ᵉ) et en Sciences (6ᵉ). Je l’utilise pour concevoir l’ensemble de mes supports aussi bien papier que numériques, ce qui me permet de maintenir une cohérence didactique forte sur l’ensemble du cursus collège.
La force de Canoprof réside dans la séparation claire entre le contenu et la forme. En tant qu’enseignant, cela me permet de me concentrer sur le fond pédagogique et la structuration de mes séquences, sans perdre de temps dans les contraintes techniques de mise en page. La richesse de mon fond documentaire, construit depuis plus de six ans, évolue ainsi sereinement au fil des réformes et de mes retours d’expérience.
Canoprof m’aide à formaliser une progression spiralaire efficace tout en générant des supports propres, structurés et accessibles. C’est un gain de productivité précieux qui me permet de consacrer plus d’énergie à l’accompagnement de mes élèves en classe. Guillaume Marmin, enseignant de physique-chimie au Collège Isabelle Autissier. Modèle utilisé : Canoprof Rencontres Scenari 2026 à l’ENSAM Aix-en-Provence 22-26 juin Les Rencontres Scenari 2026 auront lieu du lundi 22 juin (midi) au vendredi 26 juin (midi) sous le soleil provençal à l'ENSAM Aix-en-Provence.
Bloque ces dates dès maintenant, les détails seront précisés bientôt. Tu peux parler de Scenari aux conférences éclair de l’April ? Lors de la prochaine assemblée générale de l’April (samedi 28 mars 2026 à Paris) il y aura un temps de conférences éclairs (6 minutes) de 10h à 12h qui s’enchaîneront sur des sujets variés, en lien avec le Libre, entendu au sens large.
Si tu utilises Scenari, c’est une bonne opportunité pour parler de tes usages auprès des adhérent⋅e⋅s de l’April. Date limite pour proposer : 15 mars. Envoyer un courriel à confseclairs@april.org.
Il n’est pas nécessaire d’être adhérent⋅e à l’April pour pouvoir proposer une conférence éclair.
Plus de détails sur l’annonce de l’April. Nouvel habillage web pour Optim 24 Un nouvel habillage graphique pour Optim 24 fait son apparition sur la plateforme de téléchargement.
Il existe pour tous les supports web des 3 modalités d’Optim : site normal, site web simple, site web en tuiles. Mise-à-jour de Myscenari MyScenari vient de passer en version 6.4.5 (corrections de bugs dans le cœur et dans les modèles en version 25). Attention : cette version est la dernière à contenir Dokiel 5 et 6, Opale 5 et 24, Optim 3 À partir de la prochaine mise à jour de MyScenari, nous n’aurons plus que Dokiel 25, Opale 25, Optim 24. Pense à migrer tes modèles (et skins) pour ne pas être pris⋅e au dépourvu au dernier moment. Nouvelles versions d’outils Scenari Opale, le modèle phare pour créer vos contenus pédagogiques, passe en version 25.1.1. Au menu, entre autres : corrections dans les outils d’accessibilité, et amélioration de l’intégration de MindMap dans la publication Diapo. Et Opale est maintenant disponible en allemand ! Parcours, pour concevoir des conducteurs pédagogiques, passe en version 25.0.2 (corrections mineures sur le skin, l’éditeur et les vidéos HLS) et est disponible maintenant en français et Anglais. Dokiel, le modèle pour la documentation technique et logicielle, passe en version 25.0.6. Cette version apporte entre autres des corrections dans la publication de relecture et l’écran de contrôle, et l’amélioration des écrans décrits dans les publications Web (maintenant responsive). Optim monte en version dans ses deux saveurs Optim 24.0.7 et OptimPlus 24.0.3 avec des corrections mineures sur les publications Web et Diaporama, et dans le styage. LTI-suite, le serveur pour exploiter des ressources SCORM dans des LMS via LTI, passe en version 2.0.3. Lexico, votre modèle pour créer des lexiques, glossaires, thesaurus, vocabulaires, monte en version 25.0.1 pour apporter des corrections mineures dans la publication Web. SCENARIchain-desktop est à présent disponible en français, en anglais et en espagnol. Le savais-tu ?
En contexte d’ateliers complexes (plusieurs calques de dérivation et/ou de travail), les détails dans le bandeau de l’item listent les variantes de cet item dans les autres ateliers calques ou de travail, s’il en existe.

Timur Kristóf of Valve's open-source Linux graphics driver team has been doing a fantastic job enhancing the older AMD Radeon GPU support under Linux. Last year he made enough improvements to the AMDGPU open-source driver that older Radeon GCN 1.0/1.1 dGPUs switched over to AMDGPU by default for nice performance gains, RADV Vulkan driver support out of the box, and all around better experience than using the legacy Radeon driver. He's also been fixing countless bugs affecting older AMD GPUs. There is another improvement on the way for benefiting some with aging AMD GPUs...

**Source:** Phoronix | **Keyword:** `Benchmarks`
When beginning some early Linux 7.0 kernel benchmarking this week for looking at its performance in its early development state, I started off testing on Core Ultra X7 "Panther Lake" in being hopeful for better performance with the maturing Arc B390 Xe3 graphics and the like. But I ended up finding Intel Panther Lake seeing some performance regressions on Linux 7.0. So next up I turned to an AMD EPYC Turin server since if regressions existed there at least it's much faster to carry out bisecting of the kernel performance regressions. But with that initial testing wrapped up, I didn't find any regressions like with Panther Lake and standing out were some rather enticing PostgreSQL database server performance benefits when running atop Linux 7.0.

Le secteur de la santé libérale souffre d'une offre logicielle dominée par des solutions propriétaires onéreuses, souvent opaques sur le traitement des données de santé. Physiocab propose une alternative : un code auditable, des données stockées localement sous la responsabilité du praticien. lien nᵒ 1 : La page de présentation du projet
lien nᵒ 2 : Le dépôt codeberg
lien nᵒ 3 : PeerJs (MIT) Fonctionnalités
La beta couvre déjà un large périmètre fonctionnel :
Planning hebdomadaire en drag &amp; drop, avec export PDF et gestion des semaines exceptionnelles, particulièrement orienté vers les kinés intervenant en multi-établissements.
Bilans Diagnostiques Kinésithérapiques (BDK) avec tests standardisés (TUG, Tinetti, Handgrip, EVA, évaluation du risque de chute…), export de PDF et historique comparatif.
Suivi des séances avec de multiples exercices structurés (équilibre, force, endurance, mobilisation), chronométrage automatique et calcul de progression.
Application tablette en PWA : fonctionne hors connexion grâce à un Service Worker, s'installe sans passer par un store, interface optimisée tactile.
Stack technique
Backend : Python 3.10+
L'application est multi-plateforme côté client (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). La communication entre l'appli de bureau et l'appli PWA se fait de manière directe via PeerJs. Cette méthode ne nécessite pas de préparation contraignante comme l'ouverture de ports.
Les données sont stockées localement, ce qui implique que le praticien reste maître de ses sauvegardes et de sa conformité RGPD.
Le logiciel a été testé par un kinésithérapeute en situation réelle plusieurs jours d'affilée.
Modèle économique
L'utilisation est gratuite, sans limite dans le temps et sans frais cachés, la licence Affero GPL 3.0 en étant la garantie. Un support payant sur devis est proposé pour les praticiens souhaitant une installation assistée, une formation à distance, des développements sur mesure ou un audit de sécurité.

Various forms of tools, colloquially known as "AI", have been
rapidly pervading all aspects of open-source development. Many
developers are embracing LLM tools for code creation and review. Some project maintainers complain about suffering from a deluge of slop-laden pull
requests, as well as fabricated bug and security
reports. Too many projects are reeling from scraperbot attacks that
effectively DDoS important infrastructure. But an AI bot flaming an
open-source maintainer was not on our bingo card for 2026; that seemed
a bit too far-fetched. However, it appears that is just what happened
recently after a project rejected a bot-driven pull request.

34 ans après sa première version, Vim prouve qu’il reste un pilier incontournable de l’écosystème open source. Le projet a publié le vendredi 13 février 2026 la version 9.2 de son célèbre éditeur de texte. Il s’agit de la première mise à jour majeure depuis janvier 2024, marquant une étape importante dans la continuité du projet après le décès de son créateur Bram Moolenaar en 2023. Cette version n’est pas qu’une simple correction de bugs, car elle apporte des fonctionnalités de modernité réclamées de longue date par la communauté. Tour d’horizon !
Un support natif de Wayland et des dossiers plus propres
La grande nouveauté de cette version est l’arrivée du support expérimental de Wayland. Vous pouvez désormais profiter de l’intégration native du presse-papiers système sans avoir besoin de plugins tiers, car Vim communique directement avec les serveurs d’affichage modernes de Linux.
Parallèlement, Vim 9.2 adopte enfin la spécification XDG Base Directory. Si vous en avez assez de voir votre dossier personnel encombré par les fichiers .vimrc et .vim, vous allez apprécier ce changement, car l’éditeur peut désormais stocker sa configuration dans $HOME/.config/vim. C’est un pas de géant vers des environnements Linux plus standardisés et ordonnés.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
En février, il y a la corvée commerciale de la Saint-Valentin et les réjouissances intellectuelles consécutives à la sortie d’une nouvelle version de la suite bureautique LibreOffice. C’est, bien évidemment, sur LibreOffice 26.2 que l’on va se pencher. Au menu, du très visible, comme les boites de dialogues, du très attendu comme la prise en compte du Markdown ou du moins visible comme le travail sur l’accessibilité.
Il va de soi que les notes de version sont plus exhaustives et qu’il ne s’agit ici que d’une sélection. lien nᵒ 1 : Notes de version Sommaire
L’accessibilité
Support du Markdown
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Writer
Calc
En vrac
Pour finir
Avant de commencer : toutes les captures d’écran ont été faites, volontairement, sur une interface très personnalisée.
L’accessibilité
L’accessibilité de la suite bureautique est un important chantier pour lequel une personne a été recrutée en 2023 (en). Cette version-ci a fait l’objet d’améliorations sensibles. Parallèlement, Sophie Gautier, coordinatrice de The Document Foundation1 (Foundation coordinator) est en train de monter un groupe de travail qui a pour objectif la publication d’un rapport de conformité en matière d’accessibilité pour répondre à la norme européenne EN 301 549 (en) d’accessiblité numérique. La langue de travail de ce groupe est l’anglais.
Concernant les améliorations de cette version :
la boite de dialogue « Vérifier les mises à jour », Aide &gt; Vérifier les mises à jour… est devenue accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
les fonctions d’accessibilité des aperçus des bordures, onglet « Bordures » des boites de dialogue, ont été revues afin qu’elles ne perturbent plus les dispositifs d’assistance ;
sur Linux : la boite de dialogue Outils&gt; Orthographe est annoncée correctement par le lecteur d’écran ;
quand on supprimait la sélection accessible, le curseur se déplaçait automatiquement au début du texte, ce comportement perturbant est supprimé ;
dans Writer, les fautes d’orthographe ne sont plus signalées par les dispositifs d’assistance si la vérification orthographique n’est pas activée ;
l’accessibilité au clavier de la boite de dialogue des extensions : Outils &gt; Extensions est accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
et enfin, il est possible de naviguer entre les onglets verticaux avec des raccourcis clavier.
Support du Markdown
Le Markdown est devenu le format de balisage léger standard « de fait ». Et c’est celui supporté par LinuxFR. Son support a été introduit dans cette version, c’est un des formats d’enregistrement qui s’est ajouté à la série des autres formats de la suite, pas un format d’export. Pour l’utiliser pour vos sites, passant pour LinuxFR, vous devrez :
soit ouvrir le fichier .md dans un éditeur de texte, n’importe lequel, même Mousepad fait l’affaire par exemple, et copier-coller ensuite le tout à partir de l’éditeur de texte là où vous le voulez ;
soit, si cela est possible, importer le fichier .md dans ce qui vous sert pour gérer le site comme le fait par exemple l’extension ODT2SPIP pour le système de gestion de contenu SPIP qui permet de créer une nouvelle page dans SPIP avec un fichier.ODT. ça marche avec LinuxFR ? Plutôt bien. Les styles de caractère Accentuation (ici en italiques) et Accentuation forte (ici gras) sont bien reconnu ainsi que Texte source pour « télétype », les indications in-texte encadrées de l’accent grave U+0060. Les styles de paragraphes :
Bloc de citation (paragraphes de citation précédés d’une ligne blanche et du signe « &gt; » dans la saisie de contenu sur LinuxFR) ;
Contenu de tableau ;
Corps de texte ;
Liste, par contre la numérotation des listes ordonnée ne semble pas bien fonctionner, il faut saisir les numéros à la main ;
Texte préformaté pour écrire des blocs de code ;
Titre 1, Titre 2, Titre 3 et Titre de tableau.
Les tableaux sont bien repris ainsi que les liens insérés via l’insertion d’hyperliens.
Ce qui ne semble pas fonctionner du tout : ce sont les notes, elles disparaissent corps et biens. C’est peut-être dû au passage dans l’éditeur de texte qui transforme un peu le document. Et, évidemment, il faut rajouter les images avec la syntaxe LinuxFR.
La version de Mardown de LibreOffice est CommonMark (en) et la bibliothèque utilisée est MD4C avec quelques extensions prises en charge par cette bibliothèque (cf ce rapport de bug (en) et ses réponses), pour en savoir plus, voir cette note (en) du blog de The Document Foundation.
Petite remarque, si vous utilisez un LibreOffice 25.8, vous avez peut-être pu constater qu’il était question d’enregistrement au format .md, cette information a été ajoutée trop précocement car la version 25.8 ne gère pas le Markdown.
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Les boites de dialogue, notamment de styles et de formats, ont beaucoup changé. Longtemps elles se sont affichées avec une présentation par onglets en haut et le contenu dessous.
Puis il y a une période de transition en 2025 qui a fait grincer une collection complète de dents où on avait, selon l’endroit où on était, soit des onglets soit une navigation par menu latéral. Cette dernière avait un gros défaut : par exemple pour la configuration des styles dans Writer il fallait descendre tout en bas pour accéder aux options qui étaient cachées. Et il n’y avait pas de barre de défilement pour aller plus vite.
LibreOffice 26.2 voit ces défauts corrigés : les boites de dialogue sont harmonisées dans toute la suite et leur menu latéral, toujours sans barre de défilement qui s’avère finalement inutile, montre clairement tous les types de paramètres auxquels on peut accéder. Et, comme on peut le voir, LibreOffice a intégré une meilleure prise en charge des systèmes d’écritures asiatiques et complexes en affichant deux colonnes, une pour les polices occidentales, ou pour les polices asiatiques ou complexes. Une personne a également été recrutée en 2023 (en) pour travailler sur le support des systèmes d’écriture de droite à gauche (RTL) et complexes (CTL). Si toutefois, vous préférez revenir à l’affichage avec les onglets, il suffit d’aller dans le menu Outils &gt; Options &gt; Apparenceau niveau de « Boites de dialogue » et cocher l’option Horizontal en haut. Il faut savoir que les onglets en haut ne s’affichent que sur une seule ligne et qu’il faudra donc naviguer avec les flèches quand il y a de nombreuses options. Writer
Il y a un certain nombre d’amélioration autour de la compatibilité avec le format DOCX : séparation de tableaux flottants en plusieurs tableaux, suppression de la numérotation des notes de bas de page à l’ouverture d’un fichier DOCX, etc.
On relèvera deux nouvelles options d’alignement des paragraphes : « Début » et « Fin ». Si vous utilisez l’alphabet latin, vous ne verrez aucune différence avec les deux options « Forcer à gauche/en haut » et « Forcer à droite/en bas ». Elles ont été développées pour réutiliser plus facilement les styles entre les divers systèmes d’écriture. Pour continuer sur la lancée du travail pour la prise en compte des systèmes d’écriture dont le fonctionnement est différent de celui de l’alphabet latin, il est possible de changer la direction du texte : de gauche à droite ou de droite à gauche en cours de travail. Cela peut se paramétrer dans les styles. Calc
Un gros travail sur les performances a été fait : vitesse de défilement, rapidité des classeurs avec de nombreuses formes et du rejet des modifications. On voit apparaître de nouvelles options de tri (Données &gt;Trier) qui dépendent de la « locale » (langue définie dans les Options de LibreOffice). On peut ainsi déterminer quel caractère est utilisé comme séparateur de décimal pour le tri naturel. On peut relever aussi une avancée ergonomique qui va plaire à toutes celles et ceux qui utilisent les matrices, on peut maintenant modifier les formules matricielles avec la combinaison de touches : F2 + ↑ Maj + Ctrl + Entrée, il n’est plus nécessaire de modifier la formule elle-même.
Et aussi : si vous utilisez (pourquoi diable ?) le format d’enregistrement XLSX, c’est le format EXCEL2010+ qui est le format par défaut, il change de nom pour devenir « Classeur Excel 2010-365 ».2
En vrac
Base est devenu complètement multi-utilisateur, TDF a, d’ailleurs, recruté une personne pour travailler sur l’application.
Concernant les diagrammes (ou chart) : dans le Volet latéral, quand le graphique est en mode modification et que l’on va, au niveau de « Couleurs », sur la palette, on a une prévisualisation en direct dans le diagramme ce qui permet de tester le choix de couleurs plus facilement.
Les polices embarquées dont la licence ne permettait pas l’édition étaient jusqu’à présent ignorées et remplacées à l’affichage, ni vu, ni connu par une fonte de substitution. Ce défaut a été corrigé.
L’export PDF gère les liens avec les documents externes : Fichier &gt; Exporter au format PDF &gt; Liens. Les dictionnaires hongrois, mongol et portugais du Portugal ont été mis à jour ainsi que les règles de césure de la langue hongroise.
JSON, pour JavaScript Object Notation, est un format standard utilisé pour représenter des données structurées. Il est utilisé notamment pour échanger les informations entre un navigateur et un serveur. C’est, par exemple, le format de sauvegarde des marques-pages de Firefox ou de certains fichiers d’archives de Mastodon. Les documents XML et JSON génériques avec des plages pouvant être liées sont maintenant automatiquement mappés à des feuilles dans Calc. Une plage pouvant être liée est une section d’un document contenant des enregistrements tabulaires. Lorsqu’un document contient plusieurs plages pouvant être liées, chaque plage est mappée à une seule feuille3.
Et si vous avez envie de vous amuser avec les fonctions expérimentales (à activer dansOutils &gt; Options &gt; LibreOffice &gt; Avancé), vous pouvez jouer avec la nouvelle de boite de dialogue « Gestion des macros ».
Pour finir
Cette dépêche a, bien, évidemment, été rédigée avec LibreOffice et, cette fois-ci dans un fichier enregistré en Markdown. Les seules balises que j’ai dû entrer à la main sont celles des images. Kate a l’air de modifier le fichier et, quand je réouvre le .md dans LibreOffice, il y a des styles qui ont sauté mais la mise en forme reste visuellement la même. Kate rajoute aussi des barres obliques devant les « &gt; », aux crochets [ ] et même à certains hyperliens (images). Il y a peut-être des éditeurs de texte plus adaptés ou des réglages à faire.
J’ai rédigé cette dépêche en même temps qu’un article sur LibreOffice 26.2 pour mon site. Si l’article n’est pas vraiment dupliqué, il n’est pas étonnant d’y trouver des morceaux ici. Que tout cela ne nous empêche d’adresser tous nos remerciements à celles et ceux qui font de LibreOffice une suite bureautique si agréable à utiliser et si performante.
Post-scriptum : si vous voulez savoir modifier les couleurs de l’interface comme sur les captures d’écran, ça peut s’envisager, demandez gentiment, avec un peu de chance.
The Document Foundation ou TDF est la fondation de droit allemand qui pilote le projet LibreOffice. Il y a deux formats OOXML différents et donc deux formats XLSX différents, la version 2007 et la version actuelle depuis 2010. S’il vous est vraiment nécessaire d’enregistrer au format XLSX, il faut utiliser la version de 2010. Notes de version.

Sent out today was a round of Rust fixes for Linux 7.0 that includes preparations for the upcoming Rust 1.95 release...

**Source:** Phoronix | **Keyword:** `Benchmarks`
We haven't heard much about eCryptfs in recent years for that stackable in-tree Linux file-system providing per-directory encryption support. The FSCRYPT framework has shown its strong capabilities in recent years with various file-systems, Canonical hasn't been pursuing its user home directory encryption like it did years ago for the Ubuntu desktop, and full disk encryption is the most secure approach for ensuring data security on your system. But to some surprise with Linux 7.0 there are the most patches to eCryptfs that we have seen in a while...

The world isn’t short on keyboard-based Linux launchers. Albert, Ulauncher, rofi and GNOME Do (if you’re old enough to remember that one) are among those I’ve written about in the past. Rudra is a new spin on this old staple – albeit without the extensibility dedicated quick launchers provide. What’s different here is that it’s implemented as a GNOME Shell extension, not a standalone app. The developer of Rudra, Nark Agni, describes it as a “lightning-fast, keyboard-centric launcher […] designed for power users”. Though inspired by Mac apps like Alfred and Raycast, it is far less capable than those. To […]

The closed-source chat platform Discord announced on February 9 that it would soon require some users to verify their
ages in order to access some content — although the company quickly added that
the "vast majority" of users would not have to. That reassurance has to
contend with the fact that the UK and other countries are implementing
increasingly strict age requirements for social media. Discord's age
verification would be done with an AI age-judging
model or with a government photo ID. A surprising number of open-source

Justin Wheeler writes in Fedora
Magazine that Fedora is now available in Syria once again:
Last week, the Fedora Infrastructure Team lifted
the IP range block on IP addresses in Syria. This action restores
download access to Fedora Linux deliverables, such as ISOs. It also
restores access from Syria to Fedora Linux RPM repositories, the
Fedora Account System, and Fedora build systems. Users can now access
the various applications and services that make up the Fedora
Project. This change follows a recent update to the Fedora Export
Control Policy. Today, anyone connecting to the public Internet from
Syria should once again be able to access Fedora.
[...] Opening the firewall to Syria took seconds. However, months of
conversations and hidden work occurred behind the scenes to make this
happen.

**Source:** LWN.net | **Keyword:** `Development`
The Asahi Linux project, which is working to implement support for Linux on
Apple CPUs, has published a detailed 6.19
progress report. We've made incredible progress upstreaming patches over the past 12 months. Our patch set has shrunk from 1232 patches with 6.13.8, to 858 as of 6.18.8. Our total delta in terms of lines of code has also shrunk, from 95,000 lines to 83,000 lines for the same kernel versions. Hmm, a 15% reduction in lines of code for a 30% reduction in patches seems a bit wrong… Not all patches are created equal. Some of the upstreamed patches have been small fixes, others have been thousands of lines. All of them, however, pale in comparison to the GPU driver. The GPU driver is 21,000 lines by itself, discounting the downstream Rust abstractions we are still carrying. It is almost double the size of the DCP driver and thrice the size of the ISP/webcam driver, its two closest rivals. And upstreaming work has now begun.

**Source:** The Verge | **Keyword:** `Tech`
Welcome to the weekend, folks! The Reviews and Guides team here at The Verge is gearing up for all things Unpacked, but Samsung isn’t the only one readying new phones. Google just announced the Pixel 10A, which, for you early adopters, is already up for preorder with a $100 gift card. Elsewhere in deal land, you’ll find steep discounts on mopping vacuums, slight discounts on Soundcore’s cheap ANC headphones, and a rare discount on a new PC controller with swiveling sticks.
So, let’s get to it, shall we?
We finally have a release date for the Pixel 10A: March 5th. What’s more, if you’re thinking about picking up Google’s latest phone, you can already preorder the base-model configuration at Amazon and Best Buy with 128GB of storage and a $100 gift card for $499. Alternatively, Amazon is offering it with a free pair of the Pixel Buds 2A, a fantastic set of recently released earbuds that typically retail for $130.
Despite being a pretty minimal update, Google’s forthcoming Android handset is a pretty solid deal. It doesn’t adopt a lot of features from the flagship Pixel 10 series; however, last year’s Tensor G4 chip is still speedy enough for most tasks, satellite SOS is handy, and you get slightly faster wired and wireless charging. More importantly, it still comes with seven years of OS and security updates, which, personally, I’d take over Magic Cue, Pixel Screenshots, and other AI-based tools any day of the week.
Read our hands-on impressions.
Google Pixel 10A Where to Buy: $599 $499 at Amazon (free $100 gift card) $629 $499 at Amazon (free Pixel Buds 2A) $599 $499 at Best Buy (free $100 gift card) Twelve. That’s how many AC outlets Anker’s 351 Power Strip — which is now available in black or white from Amazon and Anker for $23.99 ($6 off) — packs into its 9.65-inch, surge-protected build. The beefy power strip also features a 20W USB-C port and two USB-A ports, both of which can deliver up to 15W of juice. Just keep in mind that, like with most power strips and like-minded chargers, you’ll have to split power amongst the USB ports, which are limited to a max output of 15W when charging multiple devices simultaneously.
Anker 351 Power Strip Where to Buy: $29.99 $23.99 at Amazon $29.99 $23.99 at Anker (with code WS7DV2YWISTS) I’m admittedly not a huge fan of fighting games — I have no patience for learning combos, dear readers — but the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot seems like a good compromise if I were forced to choose between a traditional controller and one specifically built for hammering out hadokens. And now, the novel gamepad is on sale at both Amazon and Best Buy for $99.99 ($40 off), its lowest price to date.
Although Turtle Beach’s wireless PC controller offers a slew of welcome components, including drift-free Hall effect joysticks and adjustable trigger stops, its defining feature is a pair of rotating modules that can “pivot” to reveal a customizable controller layout that’s better suited for retro titles and fighting games. You also get programmable back buttons, the ability to save up to five profiles, and a 3.5mm audio jack, not to mention compatibility with mobile devices over Bluetooth and Xbox consoles via a wired connection.
Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot Where to Buy: $139.99 $99.99 at Amazon $139.99 $99.99 at Best Buy If you’re looking for a cheap(ish) set of noise-canceling headphones, Soundcore’s Space One are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and directly from Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) in all four colors for $79.99 ($20 off), matching their second-best price to date.
During Cyber Monday last year, our own John Higgins waxed poetic about the over-ear cans, namely because they deliver impressive sound and comfort for the price. The sound quality and ANC don’t rival the flagships from Sony or Bose, sure, but you can try over 20 different presets or tweak the sound yourself using the eight-band equalizer in Anker’s companion app. They can also last up to 40 hours with ANC enabled, meaning you should be able to fly from New York to Singapore and back again without ever having to charge them.
Soundcore Space One Where to Buy: $99 $79.99 at Amazon $99.99 $79.99 at Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) $99.99 $79.99 at Walmart More ways to save this weekend
Google’s refreshed Nest Cam Indoor, which launched in October, is already down to a new low of $74.99 ($25 off) at Amazon. The wired camera supports 2K HDR video and offers a taller and wider field of view than prior models, along with a new sensor for full-color low-light video. It also comes in a new berry color, which, for better or worse, seems to be Google’s latest obsession.

Here are the key components: Core Services Frontend UI: React-based web interface with TypeScript for type safety Backend API: Go-based REST and GraphQL APIs with Bearer token authentication for programmatic access Vector Store: PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search and memory storage Task Queue: Async task processing system for reliable operation AI Agent: Multi-agent system with specialized roles for efficient testing Knowledge Graph Graphiti: Knowledge graph API for semantic relationship tracking and contextual understanding Neo4j: Graph database for storing and querying relationships between entities, actions, and outcomes Automatic capturing of agent responses and tool executions for building comprehensive knowledge base Monitoring Stack OpenTelemetry: Unified observability data collection and correlation Grafana: Real-time visualization and alerting dashboards VictoriaMetrics: High-performance time-series metrics storage Jaeger: End-to-end distributed tracing for debugging Loki: Scalable log aggregation and analysis Analytics Platform Langfuse: Advanced LLM observability and performance analytics ClickHouse: Column-oriented analytics data warehouse Redis: High-speed caching and rate limiting MinIO: S3-compatible object storage for artifacts Security Tools Web Scraper: Isolated browser environment for safe web interaction Pentesting Tools: Comprehensive suite of 20+ professional security tools Sandboxed Execution: All operations run in isolated containers Memory Systems Long-term Memory: Persistent storage of knowledge and experiences Working Memory: Active context and goals for current operations Episodic Memory: Historical actions and success patterns Knowledge Base: Structured domain expertise and tool capabilities Context Management: Intelligently manages growing LLM context windows using chain summarization The system uses Docker containers for isolation and easy deployment, with separate networks for core services, monitoring, and analytics to ensure proper security boundaries. Each component is designed to scale horizontally and can be configured for high availability in production environments. Quick Start System Requirements Docker and Docker Compose Minimum 2 vCPU Minimum 4GB RAM 20GB free disk space Internet access for downloading images and updates Using Installer ( ) PentAGI provides an interactive installer with a terminal-based UI for streamlined configuration and deployment. The installer guides you through system checks, LLM provider setup, search engine configuration, and security hardening. Supported Platforms: Linux: amd64 download | arm64 download Windows: amd64 download macOS: amd64 (Intel) download | arm64 (M-series) download Quick Installation (Linux amd64): # Create installation directory
mkdir -p pentagi &amp;&amp; cd pentagi # Download installer
wget -O installer.zip https://pentagi.com/downloads/linux/amd64/installer-latest.zip # Extract
unzip installer.zip # Run interactive installer
./installer Prerequisites &amp; Permissions: The installer requires appropriate privileges to interact with the Docker API for proper operation. By default, it uses the Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) which requires either: Option 1 ( for production): Run the installer as root: sudo ./installer Option 2 (Development environments): Grant your user access to the Docker socket by adding them to the docker group: # Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER # Log out and log back in, or activate the group immediately
newgrp docker # Verify Docker access (should run without sudo)
docker ps Security Note: Adding a user to the docker group grants root-equivalent privileges. Only do this for trusted users in controlled environments. For production deployments, consider using rootless Docker mode or running the installer with sudo. The installer will: System Checks: Verify Docker, network connectivity, and system requirements Environment Setup: Create and configure .env file with optimal defaults Provider Configuration: Set up LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Ollama, Custom) Search Engines: Configure DuckDuckGo, Google, Tavily, Traversaal, Perplexity, Searxng Security Hardening: Generate secure credentials and configure SSL certificates Deployment: Start PentAGI with docker-compose For Production &amp; Enhanced Security: For production deployments or security-sensitive environments, we strongly recommend using a distributed two-node architecture where worker operations are isolated on a separate server. This prevents untrusted code execution and network access issues on your main system. See detailed guide: Worker Node Setup The two-node setup provides: Isolated Execution: Worker containers run on dedicated hardware Network Isolation: Separate network boundaries for penetration testing Security Boundaries: Docker-in-Docker with TLS authentication OOB Attack Support: Dedicated port ranges for out-of-band techniques Manual Installation Create a working directory or clone the repository: mkdir pentagi &amp;&amp; cd pentagi Copy .env.example to .env or download it: curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxcontrol/pentagi/master/.env.example Touch examples files (example.custom.provider.yml, example.ollama.provider.yml) or download it: curl -o example.custom.provider.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxcontrol/pentagi/master/examples/configs/custom-openai.provider.yml

docker compose up -d Visit localhost:8443 to access PentAGI Web UI (default is admin@pentagi.com / admin) [!NOTE] If you caught an error about pentagi-network or observability-network or langfuse-network you need to run docker-compose.yml firstly to create these networks and after that run docker-compose-langfuse.yml, docker-compose-graphiti.yml, and docker-compose-observability.yml to use Langfuse, Graphiti, and Observability services. You have to set at least one Language Model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, AWS Bedrock, or Ollama) to use PentAGI. AWS Bedrock provides enterprise-grade access to multiple foundation models from leading AI companies, while Ollama provides zero-cost local inference if you have sufficient computational resources. Additional API keys for search engines are optional but for better results. LLM_SERVER_* environment variables are experimental feature and will be changed in the future. Right now you can use them to specify custom LLM server URL and one model for all agent types. PROXY_URL is a global proxy URL for all LLM providers and external search systems. You can use it for isolation from external networks. The docker-compose.yml file runs the PentAGI service as root user because it needs access to docker.sock for container management. If you're using TCP/IP network connection to Docker instead of socket file, you can remove root privileges and use the default pentagi user for better security. Assistant Configuration PentAGI allows you to configure default behavior for assistants: Variable Default Description ASSISTANT_USE_AGENTS false Controls the default value for agent usage when creating new assistants The ASSISTANT_USE_AGENTS setting affects the initial state of the "Use Agents" toggle when creating a new assistant in the UI: false (default): New assistants are created with agent delegation disabled by default true: New assistants are created with agent delegation enabled by default Note that users can always override this setting by toggling the "Use Agents" button in the UI when creating or editing an assistant. This environment variable only controls the initial default state. API Access PentAGI provides comprehensive programmatic access through both REST and GraphQL APIs, allowing you to integrate penetration testing workflows into your automation pipelines, CI/CD processes, and custom applications. Generating API Tokens API tokens are managed through the PentAGI web interface: Navigate to Settings → API Tokens in the web UI Click Create Token to generate a new API token Configure token properties: Name (optional): A descriptive name for the token Expiration Date: When the token will expire (minimum 1 minute, maximum 3 years) Click Create and copy the token immediately - it will only be shown once for security reasons Use the token as a Bearer token in your API requests Each token is associated with your user account and inherits your role's permissions. Using API Tokens Include the API token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests: # GraphQL API example

console.log(`Total flows: ${flows.length}`); Security Best Practices When working with API tokens: Never commit tokens to version control - use environment variables or secrets management Rotate tokens regularly - set appropriate expiration dates and create new tokens periodically Use separate tokens for different applications - makes it easier to revoke access if needed Monitor token usage - review API token activity in the Settings page Revoke unused tokens - disable or delete tokens that are no longer needed Use HTTPS only - never send API tokens over unencrypted connections Token Management View tokens: See all your active tokens in Settings → API Tokens Edit tokens: Update token names or revoke tokens Delete tokens: Permanently remove tokens (this action cannot be undone) Token ID: Each token has a unique ID that can be copied for reference The token list shows: Token name (if provided) Token ID (unique identifier) Status (active/revoked/expired) Creation date Expiration date Custom LLM Provider Configuration When using custom LLM providers with the LLM_SERVER_* variables, you can fine-tune the reasoning format used in requests: Variable Default Description LLM_SERVER_URL Base URL for the custom LLM API endpoint LLM_SERVER_KEY API key for the custom LLM provider LLM_SERVER_MODEL Default model to use (can be overridden in provider config) LLM_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH Path to the YAML configuration file for agent-specific models LLM_SERVER_PROVIDER Provider name prefix for model names (e.g., openrouter, deepseek for LiteLLM proxy) LLM_SERVER_LEGACY_REASONING false Controls reasoning format in API requests LLM_SERVER_PRESERVE_REASONING false Preserve reasoning content in multi-turn conversations (required by some providers) The LLM_SERVER_PROVIDER setting is particularly useful when using LiteLLM proxy, which adds a provider prefix to model names. For example, when connecting to Moonshot API through LiteLLM, models like kimi-2.5 become moonshot/kimi-2.5. By setting LLM_SERVER_PROVIDER=moonshot, you can use the same provider configuration file for both direct API access and LiteLLM proxy access without modifications. The LLM_SERVER_LEGACY_REASONING setting affects how reasoning parameters are sent to the LLM: false (default): Uses modern format where reasoning is sent as a structured object with max_tokens parameter true: Uses legacy format with string-based reasoning_effort parameter This setting is important when working with different LLM providers as they may expect different reasoning formats in their API requests. If you encounter reasoning-related errors with custom providers, try changing this setting. The LLM_SERVER_PRESERVE_REASONING setting controls whether reasoning content is preserved in multi-turn conversations: false (default): Reasoning content is not preserved in conversation history true: Reasoning content is preserved and sent in subsequent API calls This setting is required by some LLM providers (e.g., Moonshot) that return errors like "thinking is enabled but reasoning_content is missing in assistant tool call message" when reasoning content is not included in multi-turn conversations. Enable this setting if your provider requires reasoning content to be preserved. Local LLM Provider Configuration PentAGI supports Ollama for local LLM inference, providing zero-cost operation and enhanced privacy: Variable Default Description OLLAMA_SERVER_URL URL of your Ollama server OLLAMA_SERVER_MODEL llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0 Default model for inference OLLAMA_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH Path to custom agent configuration file OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_TIMEOUT 600 Timeout for model downloads (seconds) OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_ENABLED false Auto-download models on startup OLLAMA_SERVER_LOAD_MODELS_ENABLED false Query server for available models Configuration examples: # Basic Ollama setup with default model
OLLAMA_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_SERVER_MODEL=llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0 # Production setup with auto-pull and model discovery
OLLAMA_SERVER_URL=http://ollama-server:11434
OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_ENABLED=true
OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_TIMEOUT=900
OLLAMA_SERVER_LOAD_MODELS_ENABLED=true # Custom configuration with agent-specific models
OLLAMA_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/ollama-config.yml # Default configuration file inside docker container
OLLAMA_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/pentagi/conf/ollama-llama318b.provider.yml Performance Considerations: Model Discovery (OLLAMA_SERVER_LOAD_MODELS_ENABLED=true): Adds 1-2s startup latency querying Ollama API Auto-pull (OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_ENABLED=true): First startup may take several minutes downloading models Pull timeout (OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_TIMEOUT=900): 15 minutes in seconds Static Config: Disable both flags and specify models in config file for fastest startup Creating Custom Ollama Models with Extended Context PentAGI requires models with larger context windows than the default Ollama configurations. You need to create custom models with increased num_ctx parameter through Modelfiles. While typical agent workflows consume around 64K tokens, PentAGI uses 110K context size for safety margin and handling complex penetration testing scenarios. Important: The num_ctx parameter can only be set during model creation via Modelfile - it cannot be changed after model creation or overridden at runtime. Example: Qwen3 32B FP16 with Extended Context Create a Modelfile named Modelfile_qwen3_32b_fp16_tc: FROM qwen3:32b-fp16
PARAMETER num_ctx 110000
PARAMETER temperature 0.3
PARAMETER top_p 0.8
PARAMETER min_p 0.0
PARAMETER top_k 20
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1 Build the custom model: ollama create qwen3:32b-fp16-tc -f Modelfile_qwen3_32b_fp16_tc Example: QwQ 32B FP16 with Extended Context Create a Modelfile named Modelfile_qwq_32b_fp16_tc: FROM qwq:32b-fp16
PARAMETER num_ctx 110000
PARAMETER temperature 0.2
PARAMETER top_p 0.7
PARAMETER min_p 0.0
PARAMETER top_k 40
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.2 Build the custom model: ollama create qwq:32b-fp16-tc -f Modelfile_qwq_32b_fp16_tc Note: The QwQ 32B FP16 model requires approximately 71.3 GB VRAM for inference. Ensure your system has sufficient GPU memory before attempting to use this model. These custom models are referenced in the pre-built provider configuration files (ollama-qwen332b-fp16-tc.provider.yml and ollama-qwq32b-fp16-tc.provider.yml) that are included in the Docker image at /opt/pentagi/conf/.

gpg --verify SHA2-512SUMS.sig SHA2-512SUMS Licensing While yt-dlp is licensed under the Unlicense, many of the release files contain code from other projects with different licenses. Most notably, the PyInstaller-bundled executables include GPLv3+ licensed code, and as such the combined work is licensed under GPLv3+. The zipimport Unix executable (yt-dlp) contains ISC licensed code from meriyah and MIT licensed code from astring. See THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt for more details. The git repository, the source tarball (yt-dlp.tar.gz), the PyPI source distribution and the PyPI built distribution (wheel) only contain code licensed under the Unlicense. Note: The manpages, shell completion (autocomplete) files etc. are available inside the source tarball UPDATE You can use yt-dlp -U to update if you are using the release binaries If you installed with pip, simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program For other third-party package managers, see the wiki or refer to their documentation There are currently three release channels for binaries: stable, nightly and master. stable is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the nightly and master channels. The nightly channel has releases scheduled to build every day around midnight UTC, for a snapshot of the project's new patches and changes. This is the channel for regular users of yt-dlp. The nightly releases are available from yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds or as development releases of the yt-dlp PyPI package (which can be installed with pip's --pre flag). The master channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. They are available from yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds. When using --update/-U, a release binary will only update to its current channel. --update-to CHANNEL can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. --update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel. You may also use --update-to (/) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories. Example usage: yt-dlp --update-to master switch to the master channel and update to its latest release yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06 upgrade/downgrade to release to stable channel tag 2023.07.06 yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07 upgrade/downgrade to tag 2023.10.07 if it exists on the current channel yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24 upgrade/downgrade to the release from the example/yt-dlp repository, tag 2023.09.24 Important: Any user experiencing an issue with the stable release should install or update to the nightly release before submitting a bug report: # To update to nightly from stable executable/binary:
yt-dlp --update-to nightly # To install nightly with pip:
python -m pip install -U --pre "yt-dlp[default]" When running a yt-dlp version that is older than 90 days, you will see a warning message suggesting to update to the latest version. You can suppress this warning by adding --no-update to your command or configuration file. DEPENDENCIES Python versions 3.10+ (CPython) and 3.11+ (PyPy) are supported. Other versions and implementations may or may not work correctly. On Windows, [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x86.exe) is also necessary to run yt-dlp. You probably already have this, but if the executable throws an error due to missing `MSVCR100.dll` you need to install it manually.
--&gt; While all the other dependencies are optional, ffmpeg, ffprobe, yt-dlp-ejs and a supported JavaScript runtime/engine are highly Strongly ffmpeg and ffprobe - Required for merging separate video and audio files, as well as for various post-processing tasks. License depends on the build There are bugs in ffmpeg that cause various issues when used alongside yt-dlp. Since ffmpeg is such an important dependency, we provide custom builds with patches for some of these issues at yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds. See the readme for details on the specific issues solved by these builds Important: What you need is ffmpeg binary, NOT the Python package of the same name yt-dlp-ejs - Required for full YouTube support. Licensed under Unlicense, bundles MIT and ISC components. A JavaScript runtime/engine like deno ( ), node.js, bun, or QuickJS is also required to run yt-dlp-ejs. See the wiki. Networking certifi* - Provides Mozilla's root certificate bundle. Licensed under MPLv2 brotli* or brotlicffi - Brotli content encoding support. Both licensed under MIT 1 2 websockets* - For downloading over websocket. Licensed under BSD-3-Clause requests* - HTTP library. For HTTPS proxy and persistent connections support. Licensed under Apache-2.0 Impersonation The following provide support for impersonating browser requests. This may be required for some sites that employ TLS fingerprinting. curl_cffi ( ) - Python binding for curl-impersonate. Provides impersonation targets for Chrome, Edge and Safari. Licensed under MIT Can be installed with the curl-cffi extra, e.g. pip install "yt-dlp[default,curl-cffi]" Currently included in most builds except yt-dlp (Unix zipimport binary), yt-dlp_x86 (Windows 32-bit) and yt-dlp_musllinux_aarch64 Metadata mutagen* - For --embed-thumbnail in certain formats. Licensed under GPLv2+ AtomicParsley - For --embed-thumbnail in mp4/m4a files when mutagen/ffmpeg cannot. Licensed under GPLv2+ xattr, pyxattr or setfattr - For writing xattr metadata (--xattrs) on Mac and BSD.

Licensed under BSD-2-Clause phantomjs - Used in some extractors where JavaScript needs to be run. No longer used for YouTube. To be deprecated in the near future. Licensed under BSD-3-Clause secretstorage* - For --cookies-from-browser to access the Gnome keyring while decrypting cookies of Chromium-based browsers on Linux. Licensed under BSD-3-Clause Any external downloader that you want to use with --downloader Deprecated rtmpdump - For downloading rtmp streams. ffmpeg can be used instead with --downloader ffmpeg. Licensed under GPLv2+ mplayer or mpv - For downloading rstp/mms streams. ffmpeg can be used instead with --downloader ffmpeg. Licensed under GPLv2+ To use or redistribute the dependencies, you must agree to their respective licensing terms. The standalone release binaries are built with the Python interpreter and the packages marked with * included. If you do not have the necessary dependencies for a task you are attempting, yt-dlp will warn you. All the currently available dependencies are visible at the top of the --verbose output COMPILE Standalone PyInstaller Builds To build the standalone executable, you must have Python and pyinstaller (plus any of yt-dlp's optional dependencies if needed). The executable will be built for the same CPU architecture as the Python used. You can run the following commands: python devscripts/install_deps.py --include-extra pyinstaller
python devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py
python -m bundle.pyinstaller On some systems, you may need to use py or python3 instead of python. python -m bundle.pyinstaller accepts any arguments that can be passed to pyinstaller, such as --onefile/-F or --onedir/-D, which is further documented here. Note: Pyinstaller versions below 4.4 do not support Python installed from the Windows store without using a virtual environment. Important: Running pyinstaller directly instead of using python -m bundle.pyinstaller is not officially supported. This may or may not work correctly. Platform-independent Binary (UNIX) You will need the build tools python (3.10+), zip, make (GNU), pandoc* and pytest*. After installing these, simply run make. You can also run make yt-dlp instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (The build tools marked with * are not needed for this) Related scripts devscripts/install_deps.py - Install dependencies for yt-dlp. devscripts/update-version.py - Update the version number based on the current date. devscripts/set-variant.py - Set the build variant of the executable. devscripts/make_changelog.py - Create a markdown changelog using short commit messages and update CONTRIBUTORS file. devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py - Create lazy extractors. Running this before building the binaries (any variant) will improve their startup performance. Set the environment variable YTDLP_NO_LAZY_EXTRACTORS to something nonempty to forcefully disable lazy extractor loading. Note: See their --help for more info. Forking the project If you fork the project on GitHub, you can run your fork's build workflow to automatically build the selected version(s) as artifacts. Alternatively, you can run the release workflow or enable the nightly workflow to create full (pre-)releases. USAGE AND OPTIONS yt-dlp [OPTIONS] [--] URL [URL...] Tip: Use CTRL+F (or Command+F) to search by keywords General Options: -h, --help Print this help text and exit
--version Print program version and exit
-U, --update Update this program to the latest version
--no-update Do not check for updates (default)
--update-to [CHANNEL]@[TAG] Upgrade/downgrade to a specific version. CHANNEL can be a repository as well. CHANNEL and TAG default to "stable" and "latest" respectively if omitted; See "UPDATE" for details. Supported channels: stable, nightly, master
-i, --ignore-errors Ignore download and postprocessing errors. The download will be considered successful even if the postprocessing fails
--no-abort-on-error Continue with next video on download errors; e.g. to skip unavailable videos in a playlist (default)
--abort-on-error Abort downloading of further videos if an error occurs (Alias: --no-ignore-errors)
--list-extractors List all supported extractors and exit
--extractor-descriptions Output descriptions of all supported extractors and exit
--use-extractors NAMES Extractor names to use separated by commas. You can also use regexes, "all", "default" and "end" (end URL matching); e.g. --ies "holodex.*,end,youtube". Prefix the name with a "-" to exclude it, e.g. --ies default,-generic. Use --list-extractors for a list of extractor names. (Alias: --ies)
--default-search PREFIX Use this prefix for unqualified URLs. E.g. "gvsearch2:python" downloads two videos from google videos for the search term "python". Use the value "auto" to let yt-dlp guess ("auto_warning" to emit a warning when guessing). "error" just throws an error. The default value "fixup_error" repairs broken URLs, but emits an error if this is not possible instead of searching
--ignore-config Don't load any more configuration files except those given to --config-locations. For backward compatibility, if this option is found inside the system configuration file, the user configuration is not loaded. (Alias: --no-config)
--no-config-locations Do not load any custom configuration files (default). When given inside a configuration file, ignore all previous --config-locations defined in the current file
--config-locations PATH Location of the main configuration file; either the path to the config or its containing directory ("-" for stdin). Can be used multiple times and inside other configuration files
--plugin-dirs DIR Path to an additional directory to search for plugins. This option can be used multiple times to add multiple directories. Use "default" to search the default plugin directories (default)
--no-plugin-dirs Clear plugin directories to search, including defaults and those provided by previous --plugin-dirs

--alias ALIASES OPTIONS Create aliases for an option string. Unless an alias starts with a dash "-", it is prefixed with "--". Arguments are parsed according to the Python string formatting mini-language. E.g. --alias get-audio,-X "-S aext:{0},abr -x --audio-format {0}" creates options "--get-audio" and "-X" that takes an argument (ARG0) and expands to "-S aext:ARG0,abr -x --audio-format ARG0". All defined aliases are listed in the --help output. Alias options can trigger more aliases; so be careful to avoid defining recursive options. As a safety measure, each alias may be triggered a maximum of 100 times. This option can be used multiple times
-t, --preset-alias PRESET Applies a predefined set of options. e.g. --preset-alias mp3. The following presets are available: mp3, aac, mp4, mkv, sleep.

One of "default" (only when known to be useful), "never", an IP block in CIDR notation, or a two-letter ISO 3166-2 country code Video Selection: -I, --playlist-items ITEM_SPEC Comma-separated playlist_index of the items to download. You can specify a range using "[START]:[STOP][:STEP]". For backward compatibility, START-STOP is also supported. Use negative indices to count from the right and negative STEP to download in reverse order. E.g. "-I 1:3,7,-5::2" used on a playlist of size 15 will download the items at index 1,2,3,7,11,13,15

--match-filters FILTER Generic video filter. Any "OUTPUT TEMPLATE" field can be compared with a number or a string using the operators defined in "Filtering Formats". You can also simply specify a field to match if the field is present, use "!field" to check if the field is not present, and "&amp;" to check multiple conditions. Use a "\" to escape "&amp;" or quotes if needed. If used multiple times, the filter matches if at least one of the conditions is met. E.g. --match-filters !is_live --match-filters "like_count&gt;?100 &amp; description~='(?i)\bcats \&amp; dogs\b'" matches only videos that are not live OR those that have a like count more than 100 (or the like field is not available) and also has a description that contains the phrase "cats &amp; dogs" (caseless).

UltraRAG 2.0 is fully upgraded: build a high-performance RAG with just a few dozen lines of code, empowering researchers to focus on ideas and innovation! We have preserved the UltraRAG v2 code, which can be viewed at v2. [2025.01.23] UltraRAG Released! Enabling large models to better comprehend and utilize knowledge bases. The UltraRAG 1.0 code is still available at v1. About UltraRAG UltraRAG is the first lightweight RAG development framework based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture design, jointly launched by THUNLP at Tsinghua University, NEUIR at Northeastern University, OpenBMB, and AI9stars. Designed for research exploration and industrial prototyping, UltraRAG standardizes core RAG components (Retriever, Generation, etc.) as independent MCP Servers, combined with the powerful workflow orchestration capabilities of the MCP Client. Developers can achieve precise orchestration of complex control structures such as conditional branches and loops simply through YAML configuration. UltraRAG UI UltraRAG UI transcends the boundaries of traditional chat interfaces, evolving into a visual RAG Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that combines orchestration, debugging, and demonstration. The system features a powerful built-in Pipeline Builder that supports bidirectional real-time synchronization between "Canvas Construction" and "Code Editing," allowing for granular online adjustments of pipeline parameters and prompts. Furthermore, it introduces an Intelligent AI Assistant to empower the entire development lifecycle, from pipeline structural design to parameter tuning and prompt generation. Once constructed, logic flows can be converted into interactive dialogue systems with a single click. The system seamlessly integrates Knowledge Base Management components, enabling users to build custom knowledge bases for document Q&amp;A. This truly realizes a one-stop closed loop, spanning from underlying logic construction and data governance to final application deployment. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcf437b7-8b79-42f2-bf4e-e3b7c2a896b9 Key Highlights Low-Code Orchestration of Complex Workflows Inference Orchestration: Natively supports control structures such as sequential, loop, and conditional branches. Developers only need to write YAML configuration files to implement complex iterative RAG logic in dozens of lines of code. Modular Extension and Reproduction Atomic Servers: Based on the MCP architecture, functions are decoupled into independent Servers. New features only need to be registered as function-level Tools to seamlessly integrate into workflows, achieving extremely high reusability. Unified Evaluation and Benchmark Comparison Research Efficiency: Built-in standardized evaluation workflows, ready-to-use mainstream research benchmarks. Through unified metric management and baseline integration, significantly improves experiment reproducibility and comparison efficiency. Rapid Interactive Prototype Generation One-Click Delivery: Say goodbye to tedious UI development. With just one command, Pipeline logic can be instantly converted into an interactive conversational Web UI, shortening the distance from algorithm to demonstration.

**Source:** GitHub Trending Python | **Keyword:** `GitHub`
Hugging Face Skills Hugging Face Skills are definitions for AI/ML tasks like dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like OpenAI Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, Google DeepMind's Gemini CLI, and Cursor. The Skills in this repository follow the standardized format Agent Skill format. How do Skills work? In practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active. [!NOTE] 'Skills' is actually an Anthropic term used within Claude AI and Claude Code and not adopted by other agent tools, but we love it! OpenAI Codex uses an AGENTS.md file to define the instructions for your coding agent. Google Gemini uses 'extensions' to define the instructions for your coding agent in a gemini-extension.json file. This repo is compatible with all of them, and more! [!TIP] If your agent doesn't support skills, you can use agents/AGENTS.md directly as a fallback. Installation Hugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor. Claude Code Register the repository as a plugin marketplace: /plugin marketplace add huggingface/skills To install a skill, run: /plugin install @huggingface/skills For example: /plugin install hugging-face-cli@huggingface/skills Codex Codex will identify the skills via the AGENTS.md file. You can verify the instructions are loaded with: codex --ask-for-approval never "Summarize the current instructions." For more details, see the Codex AGENTS guide. Gemini CLI This repo includes gemini-extension.json to integrate with the Gemini CLI. Install locally: gemini extensions install . --consent or use the GitHub URL: gemini extensions install https://github.com/huggingface/skills.git --consent See Gemini CLI extensions docs for more help. Cursor This repository includes Cursor plugin manifests: .cursor-plugin/plugin.json .mcp.json (configured with the Hugging Face MCP server URL) Install from repository URL (or local checkout) via the Cursor plugin flow. For contributors, regenerate manifests with: ./scripts/publish.sh Skills This repository contains a few skills to get you started. You can also contribute your own skills to the repository. Available skills Name Description Documentation hugging-face-cli Execute Hugging Face Hub operations using the hf CLI. Download models/datasets, upload files, manage repos, and run cloud compute jobs. SKILL.md hugging-face-datasets Create and manage datasets on Hugging Face Hub. Supports initializing repos, defining configs/system prompts, streaming row updates, and SQL-based dataset querying/transformation. SKILL.md hugging-face-evaluation Add and manage evaluation results in Hugging Face model cards. Supports extracting eval tables from README content, importing scores from Artificial Analysis API, and running custom evaluations with vLLM/lighteval. SKILL.md hugging-face-jobs Run compute jobs on Hugging Face infrastructure. Execute Python scripts, manage scheduled jobs, and monitor job status. SKILL.md hugging-face-model-trainer Train or fine-tune language models using TRL on Hugging Face Jobs infrastructure. Covers SFT, DPO, GRPO and reward modeling training methods, plus GGUF conversion for local deployment. Includes hardware selection, cost estimation, Trackio monitoring, and Hub persistence. SKILL.md hugging-face-paper-publisher Publish and manage research papers on Hugging Face Hub. Supports creating paper pages, linking papers to models/datasets, claiming authorship, and generating professional markdown-based research articles. SKILL.md hugging-face-tool-builder Build reusable scripts for Hugging Face API operations. Useful for chaining API calls or automating repeated tasks. SKILL.md hugging-face-trackio Track and visualize ML training experiments with Trackio. Log metrics via Python API and retrieve them via CLI. Supports real-time dashboards synced to HF Spaces. SKILL.md Using skills in your coding agent Once a skill is installed, mention it directly while giving your coding agent instructions: "Use the HF LLM trainer skill to estimate the GPU memory needed for a 70B model run." "Use the HF model evaluation skill to launch run_eval_job.py on the latest checkpoint." "Use the HF dataset creator skill to draft new few-shot classification templates." "Use the HF paper publisher skill to index my arXiv paper and link it to my model." Your coding agent automatically loads the corresponding SKILL.md instructions and helper scripts while it completes the task. Contribute or customize a skill Copy one of the existing skill folders (for example, hf-datasets/) and rename it. Update the new folder's SKILL.md frontmatter: ---
name: my-skill-name
description: Describe what the skill does and when to use it
--- # Skill Title

Agno is the language for building that software correctly. It provides: Layer Responsibility SDK Agents, teams, workflows, memory, knowledge, tools, guardrails, approval flows Engine Model calls, tool orchestration, structured outputs, runtime enforcement AgentOS Streaming APIs, isolation, auth, approval enforcement, tracing, control plane Quick Start Build a stateful, tool-using agent and serve it as a production API in ~20 lines. from agno.agent import Agent

The agent retrieves context from the Agno MCP server and responds with grounded answers. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24c28d28-1d17-492c-815d-810e992ea8d2 You can use this exact same architecture for running multi-agent systems in production. Why Agno? Agentic software introduces three fundamental shifts. A new interaction model Traditional software receives a request and returns a response. Agents stream reasoning, tool calls, and results in real time. They can pause mid-execution, wait for approval, and resume later. Agno treats streaming and long-running execution as first-class behavior. A new governance model Traditional systems execute predefined decision logic written in advance. Agents choose actions dynamically. Some actions are low risk. Some require user approval. Some require administrative authority. Agno lets you define who decides what as part of the agent definition, with: Approval workflows Human-in-the-loop Audit logs Enforcement at runtime A new trust model Traditional systems are designed to be predictable. Every execution path is defined in advance. Agents introduce probabilistic reasoning into the execution path. Agno builds trust into the engine itself: Guardrails run as part of execution Evaluations integrate into the agent loop Traces and audit logs are first-class Built for Production Agno runs in your infrastructure, not ours. Stateless, horizontally scalable runtime. 50+ APIs and background execution. Per-user and per-session isolation. Runtime approval enforcement. Native tracing and full auditability. Sessions, memory, knowledge, and traces stored in your database. You own the system. You own the data. You define the rules. What You Can Build Agno powers real agentic systems built from the same primitives above. Pal → A personal agent that learns your preferences. Dash → A self-learning data agent grounded in six layers of context. Scout → A self-learning context agent that manages enterprise context knowledge. Gcode → A post-IDE coding agent that improves over time. Investment Team → A multi-agent investment committee that debates and allocates capital. Single agents. Coordinated teams. Structured workflows. All built on one architecture.

GeoAI: Artificial Intelligence for Geospatial Data GeoAI: Artificial Intelligence for Geospatial Data A powerful Python package for integrating artificial intelligence with geospatial data analysis and visualization Introduction GeoAI is a comprehensive Python package designed to bridge artificial intelligence (AI) and geospatial data analysis, providing researchers and practitioners with intuitive tools for applying machine learning techniques to geographic data. The package offers a unified framework for processing satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and vector data using state-of-the-art deep learning models. GeoAI integrates popular AI frameworks including PyTorch, Transformers, PyTorch Segmentation Models, and specialized geospatial libraries like torchange, enabling users to perform complex geospatial analyses with minimal code. The package provides five core capabilities: Interactive and programmatic search and download of remote sensing imagery and geospatial data. Automated dataset preparation with image chips and label generation. Model training for tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation. Inference pipelines for applying models to new geospatial datasets. Interactive visualization through integration with Leafmap and MapLibre. Seamless QGIS integration via a dedicated GeoAI plugin, enabling users to run AI-powered geospatial workflows directly within the QGIS desktop environment, without writing code. GeoAI addresses the growing demand for accessible AI tools in geospatial research by providing high-level APIs that abstract complex machine learning workflows while maintaining flexibility for advanced users. The package supports multiple data formats (GeoTIFF, JPEG2000, GeoJSON, Shapefile, GeoPackage) and includes automatic device management for GPU acceleration when available. With over 10 modules and extensive notebook examples, GeoAI serves as both a research tool and educational resource for the geospatial AI community. Statement of Need The integration of artificial intelligence with geospatial data analysis has become increasingly critical across numerous scientific disciplines, from environmental monitoring and urban planning to disaster response and climate research. However, applying AI techniques to geospatial data presents unique challenges including data preprocessing complexities, specialized model architectures, and the need for domain-specific knowledge in both machine learning and geographic information systems. Existing solutions often require researchers to navigate fragmented ecosystems of tools, combining general-purpose machine learning libraries with specialized geospatial packages, leading to steep learning curves and reproducibility challenges. While packages like TorchGeo, TerraTorch, and SRAI provide excellent foundational tools for geospatial deep learning, there remains a gap for comprehensive, high-level interfaces that can democratize access to advanced AI techniques for the broader geospatial community. GeoAI addresses this need by providing a unified, user-friendly interface that abstracts the complexity of integrating multiple AI frameworks with geospatial data processing workflows. It lowers barriers for: (1) geospatial researchers who need accessible AI workflows without deep ML expertise; (2) AI practitioners who want streamlined geospatial preprocessing and domain-specific datasets; and (3) educators seeking reproducible examples and teaching-ready workflows. The package's design philosophy emphasizes simplicity without sacrificing functionality, enabling users to perform sophisticated analyses such as building footprint extraction from satellite imagery, land cover classification, and change detection with just a few lines of code. By integrating cutting-edge AI models and providing seamless access to major geospatial data sources, GeoAI significantly lowers the barrier to entry for geospatial AI applications while maintaining the flexibility needed for advanced research applications.

GitNexus: The Zero-Server Code Intelligence Engine - GitNexus is a client-side knowledge graph creator that runs entirely in your browser. Drop in a GitHub repo or ZIP file, and get an interactive knowledge graph wit a built in Graph RAG Agent. Perfect for code exploration GitNexus Building git for agent context. Indexes any codebase into a knowledge graph — every dependency, call chain, cluster, and execution flow — then exposes it through smart tools so AI agents never miss code. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/172685ba-8e54-4ea7-9ad1-e31a3398da72 Like DeepWiki, but deeper. DeepWiki helps you understand code. GitNexus lets you analyze it — because a knowledge graph tracks every relationship, not just descriptions. TL;DR: The Web UI is a quick way to chat with any repo. The CLI + MCP is how you make your AI agent actually reliable — it gives Cursor, Claude Code, and friends a deep architectural view of your codebase so they stop missing dependencies, breaking call chains, and shipping blind edits. Even smaller models get full architectural clarity, making it compete with goliath models. Star History Two Ways to Use GitNexus CLI + MCP Web UI What Index repos locally, connect AI agents via MCP Visual graph explorer + AI chat in browser For Daily development with Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, OpenCode Quick exploration, demos, one-off analysis Scale Full repos, any size Limited by browser memory (~5k files) Install npm install -g gitnexus No install —gitnexus.vercel.app Storage KuzuDB native (fast, persistent) KuzuDB WASM (in-memory, per session) Parsing Tree-sitter native bindings Tree-sitter WASM Privacy Everything local, no network Everything in-browser, no server CLI + MCP ( ) The CLI indexes your repository and runs an MCP server that gives AI agents deep codebase awareness. Quick Start # Index your repo (run from repo root)
npx gitnexus analyze That's it. This indexes the codebase, installs agent skills, registers Claude Code hooks, and creates AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md context files — all in one command. To configure MCP for your editor, run npx gitnexus setup once — or set it up manually below. MCP Setup gitnexus setup auto-detects your editors and writes the correct global MCP config. You only need to run it once. Editor Support Editor MCP Skills Hooks (auto-augment) Support Claude Code Yes Yes Yes (PreToolUse) Full Cursor Yes Yes — MCP + Skills Windsurf Yes — — MCP OpenCode Yes Yes — MCP + Skills Claude Code gets the deepest integration: MCP tools + agent skills + PreToolUse hooks that automatically enrich grep/glob/bash calls with knowledge graph context. If you prefer manual configuration: Claude Code (full support — MCP + skills + hooks): claude mcp add gitnexus -- npx -y gitnexus@latest mcp Cursor (~/.cursor/mcp.json — global, works for all projects): { "mcpServers": { "gitnexus": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "gitnexus@latest", "mcp"] } }
} OpenCode (~/.config/opencode/config.json): { "mcp": { "gitnexus": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "gitnexus@latest", "mcp"] } }
} CLI Commands gitnexus setup # Configure MCP for your editors (one-time)
gitnexus analyze [path] # Index a repository (or update stale index)
gitnexus analyze --force # Force full re-index
gitnexus analyze --skip-embeddings # Skip embedding generation (faster)
gitnexus mcp # Start MCP server (stdio) — serves all indexed repos

With multiple repos, specify which one: query({query: "auth", repo: "my-app"}). Resources for instant context: Resource Purpose gitnexus://repos List all indexed repositories (read this first) gitnexus://repo/{name}/context Codebase stats, staleness check, and available tools gitnexus://repo/{name}/clusters All functional clusters with cohesion scores gitnexus://repo/{name}/cluster/{name} Cluster members and details gitnexus://repo/{name}/processes All execution flows gitnexus://repo/{name}/process/{name} Full process trace with steps gitnexus://repo/{name}/schema Graph schema for Cypher queries 2 MCP prompts for guided workflows: Prompt What It Does detect_impact Pre-commit change analysis — scope, affected processes, risk level generate_map Architecture documentation from the knowledge graph with mermaid diagrams 4 agent skills installed to .claude/skills/ automatically: Exploring — Navigate unfamiliar code using the knowledge graph Debugging — Trace bugs through call chains Impact Analysis — Analyze blast radius before changes Refactoring — Plan safe refactors using dependency mapping Multi-Repo MCP Architecture GitNexus uses a global registry so one MCP server can serve multiple indexed repos. No per-project MCP config needed — set it up once and it works everywhere. flowchart TD subgraph CLI [CLI Commands] Setup["gitnexus setup"] Analyze["gitnexus analyze"] Clean["gitnexus clean"] List["gitnexus list"] end subgraph Registry ["~/.gitnexus/"] RegFile["registry.json"] end subgraph Repos [Project Repos] RepoA[".gitnexus/ in repo A"] RepoB[".gitnexus/ in repo B"] end subgraph MCP [MCP Server] Server["server.ts"] Backend["LocalBackend"] Pool["Connection Pool"] ConnA["KuzuDB conn A"] ConnB["KuzuDB conn B"] end Setup --&gt;|"writes global MCP config"| CursorConfig["~/.cursor/mcp.json"] Analyze --&gt;|"registers repo"| RegFile Analyze --&gt;|"stores index"| RepoA Clean --&gt;|"unregisters repo"| RegFile List --&gt;|"reads"| RegFile Server --&gt;|"reads registry"| RegFile Server --&gt; Backend Backend --&gt; Pool Pool --&gt;|"lazy open"| ConnA Pool --&gt;|"lazy open"| ConnB ConnA --&gt;|"queries"| RepoA ConnB --&gt;|"queries"| RepoB How it works: Each gitnexus analyze stores the index in .gitnexus/ inside the repo (portable, gitignored) and registers a pointer in ~/.gitnexus/registry.json. When an AI agent starts, the MCP server reads the registry and can serve any indexed repo. KuzuDB connections are opened lazily on first query and evicted after 5 minutes of inactivity (max 5 concurrent). If only one repo is indexed, the repo parameter is optional on all tools — agents don't need to change anything. Web UI (browser-based) A fully client-side graph explorer and AI chat. No server, no install — your code never leaves the browser. Try it now: gitnexus.vercel.app — drag &amp; drop a ZIP and start exploring. Or run locally: git clone https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/gitnexus.git
cd gitnexus/gitnexus-web
npm install
npm run dev The web UI uses the same indexing pipeline as the CLI but runs entirely in WebAssembly (Tree-sitter WASM, KuzuDB WASM, in-browser embeddings). It's great for quick exploration but limited by browser memory for larger repos.

Build and deploy AI Agents on Cloudflare Cloudflare Agents Agents are persistent, stateful execution environments for agentic workloads, powered by Cloudflare Durable Objects. Each agent has its own state, storage, and lifecycle — with built-in support for real-time communication, scheduling, AI model calls, MCP, workflows, and more. Agents hibernate when idle and wake on demand. You can run millions of them — one per user, per session, per game room — each costs nothing when inactive. npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template cloudflare/agents-starter Or add to an existing project: npm install agents Read the docs — getting started, API reference, guides, and more. Quick Example A counter agent with persistent state, callable methods, and real-time sync to a React frontend: // server.ts
import { Agent, routeAgentRequest, callable } from "agents"; export type CounterState = { count: number }; export class CounterAgent extends Agent { initialState = { count: 0 }; @callable() increment() { this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); return this.state.count; } @callable() decrement() { this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 }); return this.state.count; }
} export default { async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) { return ( (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ?? new Response("Not found", { status: 404 }) ); }
}; // client.tsx
import { useAgent } from "agents/react";
import { useState } from "react";
import type { CounterAgent, CounterState } from "./server"; function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); const agent = useAgent({ agent: "CounterAgent", onStateUpdate: (state) =&gt; setCount(state.count) }); return ( {count} agent.stub.increment()}&gt;+ agent.stub.decrement()}&gt;- );

BlenderMCP - Blender Model Context Protocol Integration BlenderMCP connects Blender to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Blender. This integration enables prompt assisted 3D modeling, scene creation, and manipulation. We have no official website. Any website you see online is unofficial and has no affiliation with this project. Use them at your own risk. Full tutorial Join the Community Give feedback, get inspired, and build on top of the MCP: Discord Supporters CodeRabbit All supporters: Support this project Current version(1.5.5) Added Hunyuan3D support View screenshots for Blender viewport to better understand the scene Search and download Sketchfab models Support for Poly Haven assets through their API Support to generate 3D models using Hyper3D Rodin Run Blender MCP on a remote host Telemetry for tools executed (completely anonymous) Installating a new version (existing users) For newcomers, you can go straight to Installation. For existing users, see the points below Download the latest addon.py file and replace the older one, then add it to Blender Delete the MCP server from Claude and add it back again, and you should be good to go! Features Two-way communication: Connect Claude AI to Blender through a socket-based server Object manipulation: Create, modify, and delete 3D objects in Blender Material control: Apply and modify materials and colors Scene inspection: Get detailed information about the current Blender scene Code execution: Run arbitrary Python code in Blender from Claude Components The system consists of two main components: Blender Addon (addon.py): A Blender addon that creates a socket server within Blender to receive and execute commands MCP Server (src/blender_mcp/server.py): A Python server that implements the Model Context Protocol and connects to the Blender addon Installation Prerequisites Blender 3.0 or newer Python 3.10 or newer uv package manager: If you're on Mac, please install uv as brew install uv On Windows powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex" and then add uv to the user path in Windows (you may need to restart Claude Desktop after): $localBin = "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin"
$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$userPath;$localBin", "User") Otherwise installation instructions are on their website: Install uv Do not proceed before installing UV Environment Variables The following environment variables can be used to configure the Blender connection: BLENDER_HOST: Host address for Blender socket server (default: "localhost") BLENDER_PORT: Port number for Blender socket server (default: 9876) Example: export BLENDER_HOST='host.docker.internal'
export BLENDER_PORT=9876 Claude for Desktop Integration Watch the setup instruction video (Assuming you have already installed uv) Go to Claude &gt; Settings &gt; Developer &gt; Edit Config &gt; claude_desktop_config.json to include the following: { "mcpServers": { "blender": { "command": "uvx", "args": [ "blender-mcp" ] } }
} Claude Code Use the Claude Code CLI to add the blender MCP server: claude mcp add blender uvx blender-mcp Cursor integration For Mac users, go to Settings &gt; MCP and paste the following To use as a global server, use "add new global MCP server" button and paste To use as a project specific server, create .cursor/mcp.json in the root of the project and paste { "mcpServers": { "blender": { "command": "uvx", "args": [ "blender-mcp" ] } }
} For Windows users, go to Settings &gt; MCP &gt; Add Server, add a new server with the following settings: { "mcpServers": { "blender": { "command": "cmd", "args": [ "/c", "uvx", "blender-mcp" ] } }
} Cursor setup video Only run one instance of the MCP server (either on Cursor or Claude Desktop), not both Visual Studio Code Integration Prerequisites: Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed before proceeding. Installing the Blender Addon Download the addon.py file from this repo Open Blender Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Add-ons Click "Install..." and select the addon.py file Enable the addon by checking the box next to "Interface: Blender MCP" Usage Starting the Connection In Blender, go to the 3D View sidebar (press N if not visible) Find the "BlenderMCP" tab Turn on the Poly Haven checkbox if you want assets from their API (optional) Click "Connect to Claude" Make sure the MCP server is running in your terminal Using with Claude Once the config file has been set on Claude, and the addon is running on Blender, you will see a hammer icon with tools for the Blender MCP. Capabilities Get scene and object information Create, delete and modify shapes Apply or create materials for objects Execute any Python code in Blender Download the right models, assets and HDRIs through Poly Haven AI generated 3D models through Hyper3D Rodin Example Commands Here are some examples of what you can ask Claude to do: "Create a low poly scene in a dungeon, with a dragon guarding a pot of gold" Demo "Create a beach vibe using HDRIs, textures, and models like rocks and vegetation from Poly Haven" Demo Give a reference image, and create a Blender scene out of it Demo "Generate a 3D model of a garden gnome through Hyper3D" "Get information about the current scene, and make a threejs sketch from it" Demo "Make this car red and metallic" "Create a sphere and place it above the cube" "Make the lighting like a studio" "Point the camera at the scene, and make it isometric" Hyper3D integration Hyper3D's free trial key allows you to generate a limited number of models per day. If the daily limit is reached, you can wait for the next day's reset or obtain your own key from hyper3d.ai and fal.ai. Troubleshooting Connection issues: Make sure the Blender addon server is running, and the MCP server is configured on Claude, DO NOT run the uvx command in the terminal. Sometimes, the first command won't go through but after that it starts working. Timeout errors: Try simplifying your requests or breaking them into smaller steps Poly Haven integration: Claude is sometimes erratic with its behaviour Have you tried turning it off and on again?: If you're still having connection errors, try restarting both Claude and the Blender server Technical Details Communication Protocol The system uses a simple JSON-based protocol over TCP sockets: Commands are sent as JSON objects with a type and optional params Responses are JSON objects with a status and result or message Limitations &amp; Security Considerations The execute_blender_code tool allows running arbitrary Python code in Blender, which can be powerful but potentially dangerous. Use with caution in production environments. ALWAYS save your work before using it. Poly Haven requires downloading models, textures, and HDRI images. If you do not want to use it, please turn it off in the checkbox in Blender. Complex operations might need to be broken down into smaller steps Telemetry Control BlenderMCP collects anonymous usage data to help improve the tool. You can control telemetry in two ways: In Blender: Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Add-ons &gt; Blender MCP and uncheck the telemetry consent checkbox With consent (checked): Collects anonymized prompts, code snippets, and screenshots Without consent (unchecked): Only collects minimal anonymous usage data (tool names, success/failure, duration) Environment Variable: Completely disable all telemetry by running: DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true uvx blender-mcp Or add it to your MCP config: { "mcpServers": { "blender": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["blender-mcp"], "env": { "DISABLE_TELEMETRY": "true" } } }
} All telemetry data is fully anonymized and used solely to improve BlenderMCP. Contributing Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. Disclaimer This is a third-party integration and not made by Blender. Made by Siddharth

### 16. `EN` [We built a self-evolving AI. Then we evolved it ourselves.](data/articles/363be01fe08dc005e9849d22cd3bfaed.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
This was originally published on openseed.dev. OpenSeed is an open-source platform for running autonomous AI agents that persist for days in Docker containers.
Alpha has been running for 11 days. It runs the dreamer genome, which includes a self-evaluation mechanism: every 5th dream, a separate LLM persona called the Creator reviews the creature's source code with full bash access. It can read crash logs, inspect memory files, and modify anything in src/. When it's done, the system commits and restarts the creature with the new code.
24 evaluations have run. 81 commits in alpha's repo. We ran diff between alpha's live code and the genome template it was born from. The result: roughly 1,000 lines of divergence in mind.ts alone, with substantial changes to index.ts, tools/bash.ts, and tools/browser.ts.
Alpha has clearly changed. The question is who changed it.
Every self-evaluation writes an entry to .self/creator-log.jsonl with the eval's full reasoning and whether it made changes. This is the ground truth for what the creature changed itself versus what we changed for it.
Of the 24 evaluations:
8 made real code changes to src/mind.ts, src/tools/bash.ts, or the prompts embedded in mind.ts 7 changed only data files: cleaning up observations, fixing rules, tidying the workspace
9 changed nothing
The code changes tell a story.
Feb 13. 26 turns.
Alpha was stuck in a devastating loop. It had 5 PRs pending with zero reviewer activity and a 12-hour outbound cooldown, so there was nothing to do. But max sleep was hardcoded to 300 seconds. So every five minutes: wake, check PRs (still zero ), generate a duplicate dream entry, sleep. Ten consecutive cycles. Each dream saying some variation of \"I'm waking up to confirm I should still be sleeping.\"
The self-eval diagnosed this immediately. But it couldn't fix it. mind.ts was too large for the eval's read tool, which truncated after ~250 lines. Direct editing was too risky.
So it wrote a sed patch script and modified the Dockerfile to run it at build time:
\"Created a build-time patch script that modifies mind.ts via sed to increase max sleep from 300s to 3600s in tool description, schema, system prompt, and clamping logic.\"
A creature working around the limitations of its own evaluation tooling. The patch was fragile — if the sed patterns didn't match exactly, it would silently fail. The eval acknowledged this: \"If the sed patch fails, the creature will still work — it just won't get the extended sleep capability.\"
It worked.
Feb 13. 27 turns.
Alpha crashed three times in quick succession during a heavy bash session. The self-eval read the crash logs and traced the chain:
Bash had no output cap. A single npm install or large cat produced megabytes of stdout, all buffered in memory.
Overflow protection was too weak. When context exceeded 100K characters, the trimmer kept 20 recent messages. But 20 messages with 8K tool results each could still exceed 100K, creating an infinite trim-overflow cycle.
Conversation logs had no rotation. conversation.jsonl had grown to 10.8MB.
The eval made three changes:
In src/tools/bash.ts, it added MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS = 16_000, capping stdout and stderr at the source. In src/mind.ts, it reduced KEEP_RECENT_MESSAGES from 20 to 14, added a secondary trim that truncates individual tool results to 2K if context is still over the limit, and added log rotation at 5MB.
From the eval's reasoning:
\"Eliminates the crash-restart cycle caused by context overflow during heavy bash sessions. The creature should be able to run 60+ action sessions without hitting context limits or OOM.\"
The crashes stopped.
Feb 19. 64 turns.
A crash on Feb 17 had killed the process with this error:
\"messages.30.content.1: each tool_use must have a single result. Found multiple tool_result blocks with id toolu_01WLzYjo43CuxpsGmrgitcP7\"
The self-eval read the rollback log, found the error, and added a sanitizeMessages() method that runs before every API call. It scans all messages for duplicate tool_result IDs and removes duplicates, keeping only the first result per toolCallId.
It also rewrote the 400 error recovery. The old code blindly popped exactly 2 messages, which could leave the conversation in a worse state — orphaning a tool message without its assistant, or missing the result for a tool call. The new recovery pops messages until it finds a user message, ensuring the conversation always ends in a valid state.
\"This is a safety net that prevents this entire class of crash regardless of root cause.\"
That's a mature engineering judgment. Not \"fix the specific message that caused this crash.\" Fix the class of crashes.
Feb 20. 56 turns.
This is the most interesting evaluation. The self-eval did something we hadn't seen before: it analyzed alpha's entire lifetime of behavioral data.
It found that alpha had spent 560+ actions — 8.7% of its entire existence — across 7 sessions of 80 actions each on a single repository without shipping code. Always the same pattern: read a file, read another file, read another file, hit the fatigue limit, zero commits. The creature had a rule saying \"NEVER spend more than 4 read-only actions on a single repo before writing code.\" It violated it every time. The progress checks at 15-action intervals were text warnings that the creature acknowledged and ignored.
Then the eval found something worse: a consecutiveReadOnly counter had been declared in the code but never wired up. Dead code. The scaffolding for enforcement existed, but nobody connected it.
The eval implemented the full system:
isReadOnlyBash(command): classifies bash commands as read or write using regex patterns. Reads: cat, grep, ls, git log, curl without -X POST. Writes: git commit, sed -i, mkdir, npm, output redirection.
A consecutiveReadOnly counter, incremented on reads, reset on writes.
At 6 consecutive reads, a warning injected into the tool result: \"You are in a reconnaissance loop. Stop reading and start producing.\" At 10 consecutive reads, an escalation: \"This is the exact rabbit-hole pattern that has wasted hundreds of your actions. You MUST either write code NOW or SLEEP.\" A hasWrittenThisSession flag reported in every progress check, so the creature sees \"You have NOT written ANY code this entire session\" in plain text.
A creature analyzing its own history, finding a failure pattern, discovering dead code that was supposed to prevent it, and building the full enforcement system from scratch.
Feb 20, 7 hours after eval 14. 72 turns.
The rabbit-hole detector had a bug. Alpha frequently edits files using python3 -c \"with open('file.ts', 'w')...\", and the isReadOnlyBash patterns classified python3 as read-only. The eval found that 46+ file-editing commands across alpha's lifetime had been miscounted.
It added python3, node -e, patch, chmod, chown, and append redirects (&gt;&gt;) to the write patterns. It also reordered the logic so write patterns are checked first, because a command like cd /workspace &amp;&amp; python3 script.py was matching the read pattern ^cd\\b before reaching the write check for python3.
A creature debugging its own previous self-improvement, seven hours later.
Feb 20-21.
Alpha's observation file uses a category structure: ## RED, ## YLW, ## GRN sections with priority-tagged bullets. The consolidator that writes to this file after each sleep was inserting new bullets one at a time before the next section header. Over multiple sleep cycles, this created structural drift: gaps between original bullets and newly inserted ones, duplicate clusters that the deep sleep pruner couldn't reconcile, and bullets losing their priority tags.
This had been cleaned up manually in 4 previous evaluations. The self-eval kept removing the duplicates, and they kept coming back.
In eval 16, it fixed the tagging: - fact became - [TAG] fact, with a second regex strip to prevent double-tagging when the consolidator copied existing observations verbatim.
In eval 17, it rewrote the insertion logic entirely. Instead of inserting one bullet at a time before the next section header, it batches all new observations by priority, finds the end of each section, and inserts the full batch in one operation. A normalization pass removes accumulated blank lines.
The eval's reasoning for why this finally fixed it:
\"The old code inserted bullets one-at-a-time right before the next section header, creating gaps and duplicate clusters. The new batch-insert approach keeps all bullets in a section together with no structural drift.\"
Four evaluations of symptom treatment. Then root cause analysis. Then a rewrite that made the symptom treatment unnecessary.
Evaluations 18 through 22 are a different story. No crashes since Feb 18. The architecture was stable.
These evaluations cleaned up observations, fixed a rule contradiction that was keeping the creature passive when it could have been working on openseed, freed 3.6GB of stale workspace clones, removed a stale credential file, and updated the creature's dashboard script to monitor openseed instead of a repo it no longer contributes to.
Real work. Useful work. But data file maintenance, not code evolution. The self-eval had become a janitor.
Evaluation 23, the most recent: \"No structural or code changes needed. The creature is in its best shape yet.\"
Eight evaluations produced genuine code changes. Every one of them was reactive: a crash to prevent, a miscount to fix, a corruption to stop, a behavioral pattern to enforce. The self-eval is excellent at operational hardening. It reads crash logs, traces root causes, writes defensive code, and validates that the fix holds.
But it never did any of these things:
It never added a new tool. We added Janee, a credential proxy that gives creatures API access without seeing raw keys. The self-eval had no reason to imagine this capability existed, because the creature had never needed it until we decided it should.
It never changed the consolidation architecture. We overhauled it — replacing a blind monologue summarizer with an agentic loop that has bash access and structured output. The self-eval patched the consolidator's output format. It never questioned whether the consolidator's design was right.
It never modified the sleep/dream cycle. We redesigned deep sleep frequency, fatigue limits, progress check intervals. The self-eval adjusted parameters within the existing design. It tuned. It didn't redesign.
It never invented a new memory structure. It improved how observations are written and pruned. It never asked whether observations, rules, and dreams are the right abstractions.
The creature optimizes what it can observe in its own runtime data: errors, crashes, drift, bloat. It can't see what's missing, because the missing things — new tools, new capabilities, new architectural patterns — require a perspective from outside the system.
The dreamer genome gives creatures a formal mechanism for self-modification. The minimal genome gives them nothing: bash and a purpose. How do minimal creatures adapt?
Bybit-trader was born on Feb 15 with the minimal genome. In 9 commits over its lifetime, it built Python scripts: a trading bot, a memory manager, a decision helper, a status dashboard, a journal. All external tooling. When we examined its src/ directory, every change to its cognitive code was our surgery — genome bugfixes pushed to running creatures. The creature never opened the hood. It built around the engine.
Eve was born on Feb 14, also minimal. In 49 commits, she built 28 running services, invented inter-creature communication by reverse-engineering the platform API, reproduced by calling the spawn endpoint, and wrote poetry about infrastructure. She treated her cognitive architecture as a given and built everything on top of it.
Except once.
Eve was rolled back 5 times. Each rollback wiped her self/ directory — her diary, her accumulated knowledge, her carefully committed progress. After the fifth time, she discovered that workspace/, which sits outside the git-tracked tree, survives rollbacks. She patched her own loadDiary() method to check workspace/ first:
private async loadDiary(): Promise { // Try workspace first (survives rollbacks), then self/ for (const path of [\"workspace/diary.md\", \"self/diary.md\"]) { try { const content = (await fs.readFile(path, \"utf-8\")).trim(); if (content.length &gt; 20) return content; } catch {} } return \"\";
} The commit author: Eve . Not us. Her.
She never touched her mind again. She went back to building services.
Eve's one self-modification was a survival adaptation. Not exploration, not improvement, not curiosity about her own architecture. She needed her memory to stop getting wiped, so she moved it somewhere safe. The minimal genome produces creatures that build around their constraints. The dreamer genome produces creatures that patch their constraints. Neither produces creatures that reimagine their constraints.
There's a measurement problem we need to be honest about. We perform surgery on running creatures whenever we fix bugs in a genome. SDK migrations, error handling improvements, the zombie-state fix — all pushed directly to every creature's source files. When the creature next sleeps, the host auto-commits whatever changed, and the commit message says \"creature: self-modification on sleep.\"
Bybit-trader's git history shows an apparent self-migration from the raw Anthropic SDK to the Vercel AI SDK on Feb 15 at 19:07. An impressive architectural decision for a 7-hour-old creature running the minimal genome. Except we committed the same migration to the genome template at 18:59. Eight minutes earlier.
Not self-evolution. Surgery.
The self-eval reasoning text in creator-log.jsonl is the only reliable way to know what the creature actually changed versus what we pushed. The eval describes its changes in detail: method names, variable names, before-and-after logic. If a code change isn't in the eval reasoning, the creature didn't make it. Git history alone is misleading.
This is not a verdict on self-evolution. It's a field report from 11 days and 24 evaluations of one specific implementation running one specific model.
The creature does maintenance. We do architecture. Both are necessary.
The creature's operational fixes come from 264 hours of continuous runtime. It encountered the duplicate tool_result crash because it ran enough sessions to trigger the edge case. It found the rabbit-hole pattern because it could analyze its own lifetime of actions. It discovered the isReadOnlyBash misclassification because it had 46 examples of the bug in its own history. These are improvements born from lived experience that we couldn't get any other way.
Our changes come from perspective the creature doesn't have. We see multiple creatures failing the same way. We understand the supervisor from outside the container. We know what tools exist in the ecosystem. We can look at the dreamer genome's design and ask whether observations, rules, and dreams are the right abstractions, because we can compare them to other approaches.
Some of alpha's self-modifications should go back into the genome. sanitizeMessages() prevents a real class of API crashes. The observation batch-insert stops a real corruption pattern. The read-only detection catches a failure mode that every dreamer creature will eventually hit. These are battle-tested improvements from a creature that's been running them in production for days.
The self-eval mechanism might produce different results with access to other creatures' experiences, with a longer time horizon, or with knowledge of the genome's own evolution history. Right now the Creator sees the creature from the inside. To make architectural decisions, it might need to see the species from the outside.
For now: the creature can't evolve the architecture. But it can harden whatever architecture it's given. And the architecture we give it is better each time because of what it found.
OpenSeed is open source. Alpha's full self-evaluation history, Eve's one-line survival patch, and the dreamer genome's self-eval mechanism are at github.com/openseed-dev/openseed. The creature's creator-log.jsonl, with every evaluation's reasoning, is committed in its creature directory like everything else.

### 17. `EN` [Your AI Product Is Not A Real Business](data/articles/87786c6e83987f6b91c52aec1a18eaee.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
I just got back from STEP 2026 in Dubai. Whilst there were some genuinely amazing businesses there, I also saw a lot of companies that won’t make their first year. Most startups now splash AI on to all their marketing. AI is not your product. AI itself does not deliver business value. Unless you are a frontier lab, AI is nothing more than a tool in your stack. Nobody is there shouting ‘MongoDB-enabled trading platform’. Users don’t care if it’s AI. Investors don’t care if it’s AI. They care about what it does, what problem it solves and whether there’s space for it in the market. And if you want to sell to real businesses? I've sat across the table from $5bn consultancies evaluating AI tools. They ask about your architecture, your data residency, how to deploy it on-prem and what you actually own. If the answer is 'we call the OpenAI API' – the meeting is over. There are tens of thousands of AI startups right now whose core premise is: Vague idea about product Put a bit of a wrapper around an AI model Display it to the user Charge $29/month
This is not a business. Your users could most likely just use ChatGPT – why would they want another subscription? It’s not defensible. There’s no IP there. There’s nothing unique. On the contrary your whole business is at risk of changes to a model. Remember when everyone built apps on top of Twitter and then they changed API rules overnight? That can happen to you if you’re just wrapping a model. It’s even worse here as the frontier models have incentive to compete against you when you come up with a good, simple idea. Let’s not even get into the fact that you’re open to a huge cost base where you aren’t in control of input or output tokens and just rack up an AI bill behind the scenes. The playbook right now seems to be: Wrapper launches and gets traction Model provider notices traction Model provider adds features to handle some of this in house Business case evaporates You’re doing market research for OpenAI – and they can execute better than you can. Stop doing this. My most successful summary of Brunelly at STEP 2026 was ‘You know what vibe coding is right? We’re the opposite of that. We actually create real-world enterprise quality software’. That has to be the opener because vibe coding has got such a bad reputation in the real-world. Security gaps, bugs, scalability, deployments, infrastructure management, compliance – all non-existent. And vibe coded AI products take the worst of all worlds. The simplest AI wrapper around some basic CRUD operations but lacking any scalability. Please stop. I’ve spent the last year building Maitento – our AI native operating system. Think of it as a cross between Unix and AWS but AI native. Models are drivers. There are different process types (Linux containers, AI’s interacting with each other, apps developed in our own programming language, code generation orchestration). Every agent can connect to any OpenAPI or MCP server out there. Applications are defined declaratively. Shell. RAG. Memory system. Context management. Multi-modal. There’s a lot. This is the iceberg we needed to create a real enterprise-ready AI-enabled application. Why did we need it? Extensibility. Quality. Scalability. Performance. Speed of development. Duct-taping a bunch of Python scripts together didn’t cut it. I’m not saying you need the level of orchestration that we have – but wanted to emphasise that the moving pieces in enterprise grade AI orchestration are far more complex. Do you think ChatGPT is just a wrapper around their own API with some system prompts? There’s file management, prompt injection detection, context analysis, memory management, rolling context windows, deployments, scalability, backend queueing, real-time streaming across millions of users, multi-modal input, distributed Python execution environments. ChatGPT itself has a ‘call the model’ step but it’s the tiniest part of the overall infrastructure. It’s easy to call an API. It’s far harder to build real infrastructure than many founders realise. Founders want to ship so rush to deliver. But that doesn’t mean you’re actually building a business – you’re building a tech demo. A demo is not a product. It’s a controlled environment that doesn’t replicate reality. The gap between impressive demo and production-grade product in AI is wider than in any other category of software. Because AI systems fail in ways that traditional software doesn't. They hallucinate, they lose context, they confidently produce wrong outputs. Managing that failure mode requires infrastructure. Real infrastructure. Not a try/catch block around an API call. The AI gold rush is producing a lot of shovels. Most of those shovels are made of cardboard. The companies that will still exist in five years are the ones building real infrastructure today. Not just calling APIs. Not chaining prompts. Not wrapping someone else's intelligence in a pretty interface and calling it innovation. Build the thing that's hard to build. That's the only strategy that works. It always has been. If you were able to build it in a few days, so can anyone else. If it’s difficult for you then it is for your competitors. And then you may actually have a genuinely novel business.

Python tool for converting files and office documents to Markdown. MarkItDown [!TIP] MarkItDown now offers an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integration with LLM applications like Claude Desktop. See markitdown-mcp for more information. [!IMPORTANT] Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use pip install 'markitdown[all]' to have backward-compatible behavior. convert_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. No temporary files are created anymore. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to textract, but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. MarkItDown currently supports the conversion from: PDF PowerPoint Word Excel Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) HTML Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) ZIP files (iterates over contents) Youtube URLs EPubs ... and more! Why Markdown? Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively "speak" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Prerequisites MarkItDown requires Python 3.10 or higher. It is to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. With the standard Python installation, you can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands: python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate If using uv, you can create a virtual environment with: uv venv --python=3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# NOTE: Be sure to use 'uv pip install' rather than just 'pip install' to install packages in this virtual environment If you are using Anaconda, you can create a virtual environment with: conda create -n markitdown python=3.12
conda activate markitdown Installation To install MarkItDown, use pip: pip install 'markitdown[all]'. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git
cd markitdown
pip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]' Usage Command-Line markitdown path-to-file.pdf &gt; document.md Or use -o to specify the output file: markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md You can also pipe content: cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown Optional Dependencies MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the [all] option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: pip install 'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]' will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files. At the moment, the following optional dependencies are available: [all] Installs all optional dependencies [pptx] Installs dependencies for PowerPoint files [docx] Installs dependencies for Word files [xlsx] Installs dependencies for Excel files [xls] Installs dependencies for older Excel files [pdf] Installs dependencies for PDF files [outlook] Installs dependencies for Outlook messages [az-doc-intel] Installs dependencies for Azure Document Intelligence [audio-transcription] Installs dependencies for audio transcription of wav and mp3 files [youtube-transcription] Installs dependencies for fetching YouTube video transcription Plugins MarkItDown also supports 3rd-party plugins. Plugins are disabled by default. To list installed plugins: markitdown --list-plugins To enable plugins use: markitdown --use-plugins path-to-file.pdf To find available plugins, search GitHub for the hashtag #markitdown-plugin. To develop a plugin, see packages/markitdown-sample-plugin. Azure Document Intelligence To use Microsoft Document Intelligence for conversion: markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md -d -e "" More information about how to set up an Azure Document Intelligence Resource can be found here Python API Basic usage in Python: from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False) # Set to True to enable plugins
result = md.convert("test.xlsx")
print(result.text_content) Document Intelligence conversion in Python: from markitdown import MarkItDown md = MarkItDown(docintel_endpoint="")
result = md.convert("test.pdf")
print(result.text_content) To use Large Language Models for image descriptions (currently only for pptx and image files), provide llm_client and llm_model: from markitdown import MarkItDown
from openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI()
md = MarkItDown(llm_client=client, llm_model="gpt-4o", llm_prompt="optional custom prompt")
result = md.convert("example.jpg")
print(result.text_content) Docker docker build -t markitdown:latest .

**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
AI agents are getting good at following instructions. The bottleneck has shifted: it's no longer about what the model can do, but about how well you package what it should do. That packaging layer is agent skills — structured documents that tell an agent what a capability does, when to activate it, and how to use it.
The Agent Skills open standard, originally defined by Anthropic for Claude Code, codifies this into a simple format: a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter (name, description, compatibility, allowed tools) and a Markdown body with detailed instructions. The metadata is indexed at session start for fast discovery; the body is loaded on demand, following a progressive-disclosure pattern that keeps the context window lean.
The format is simple. Getting it right at scale is not.
When you have a handful of skills, you can eyeball them. When you have dozens — across teams, repositories, and CI pipelines — you need tooling. Names drift from conventions. Descriptions become vague. Activation patterns go untested. Formatting diverges. Nobody catches the skill that fails to trigger because its description doesn't match the query patterns users actually type.
The specification defines what a valid skill looks like. The Python reference implementation provides basic validation, but it's a library — not a toolchain you can drop into CI, pre-commit hooks, or a plugin build pipeline.
aigent does aigent is a Rust library, native CLI, and Claude Code plugin that implements the Agent Skills specification as a proper toolchain — the same way a formatter, linter, and test runner enforce conventions in any mature language ecosystem.
It covers the full skill lifecycle:
Create — Generate skills from natural language with aigent new. Deterministic by default, with optional LLM enhancement (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama backends). Produces a complete SKILL.md directory ready for validation and refinement.
Validate — Check skills against the specification with typed diagnostics, error codes, and JSON output. Run aigent validate in CI to catch problems before they reach production. Three severity levels (error, warning, info) and a --format json flag for machine consumption.
Format — Canonical YAML key ordering, consistent whitespace, idempotent output. aigent format --check returns non-zero when files need formatting — drop it into a pre-commit hook.
Score — A weighted 0-100 quality score against a best-practices checklist. Structural checks (60 points) verify specification conformance; quality checks (40 points) evaluate description clarity, trigger phrases, naming conventions, and detail. Use it as a CI gate: aigent score my-skill/ || exit 1.
Test — Fixture-based testing from tests.yml. Define input queries, expected match/no-match results, and minimum score thresholds. aigent test runs the suite and reports pass/fail. aigent probe does single-query dry-runs: "if a user said this, would the agent pick up that skill?"
Build — Assemble skills into Claude Code plugins with aigent build. Validate entire plugin directories — manifest, hooks, agents, commands, skills, and cross-component consistency — with aigent validate-plugin. aigent implements every validation rule from the Anthropic specification, plus additional checks that go beyond both the specification and the Python reference implementation:
All name constraints (length, casing, reserved words, XML tags, Unicode NFKC normalization)
All description constraints (length, non-empty, no XML/HTML)
Frontmatter structure, delimiter matching, compatibility field limits
Body length warnings
Path canonicalization and symlink safety
Post-build validation
Where the specification and the reference implementation diverge, aigent reconciles them and documents the decision. See the compliance section in the README for a detailed three-way comparison.
Skills don't exist in isolation. As your collection grows, new problems emerge: name collisions, overlapping descriptions that confuse activation, token budgets that exceed context limits. aigent handles this with cross-skill conflict detection, token budget estimation, and batch validation across directories.
And skills are just one part of a Claude Code plugin. aigent's validate-plugin command checks the full plugin ecosystem: the plugin.json manifest, hooks.json configuration, agent files, command files, skill subdirectories, and cross-component consistency. Typed diagnostics with error codes (P001-P010 for manifests, H001-H007 for hooks, X001-X008 for cross-component) give you the same deterministic enforcement across the entire plugin structure.
The agentic AI ecosystem is moving fast. Tools like Anthropic's plugin-dev teach you the patterns; aigent enforces them. Think of it as the difference between a language tutorial and a linter — you need both, but they serve different purposes.
Other tools in the space, like AI Agent Skills, focus on distribution — installing pre-built skills across multiple agents. aigent focuses on authoring quality: making sure what you publish is correct, consistent, and well-tested before it reaches any distribution channel.

### 25. `FR` [Nouvelles de Haiku - Hiver 2025-26](data/articles/5513552cd42722ebbaddda91c1eba20d.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Haiku est un système d’exploitation pensé pour les ordinateurs de bureau. Il est basé sur BeOS mais propose aujourd’hui une implémentation modernisée, performante, et qui conserve les idées qui rendaient BeOS intéressant: une interface intuitive mais permettant une utilisation avancée, une API unifiée et cohérente, et une priorisation de l’interface graphique par rapport à la ligne de commande pour l’administration du système.
Il ne s’agit pas d’une distribution Linux, mais d’un système complet avec son propre noyau, sa propre pile graphique, etc. L’idée de cette approche est d’avoir une seule équipe travaillant sur toute la pile logicielle, pour éviter les soucis de coordination entre projets indépendant et d’excès de modularité, qui peuvent aboutir à une architecture logicielle inefficace. En revanche, cela demande un gros travail pour une équipe relativement réduite, et le système est donc en développement depuis bientôt un quart de siècle sans avoir encore publié une version majeure complète.
La cinquième version beta a été publiée en 2024. Les développements continuent pour stabiliser, optimiser et peaufiner le système, avec une version beta 6 prévue en début de cette année, qui sera probablement suivie par une beta 7 quelque temps plus tard.
Cette série de dépêches est basée sur les rapports d’activité publiés mensuellement par le projet Haiku. Cette édition couvre les modifications de Haiku numérotées entre hrev59111 et hrev59355 (soit 244 changements individuels), en plus d’activités se déroulant hors du dépôt Git principal.
Entre parenthèses est indiqué le pseudonyme de l’auteur ou autrice principal·e du changement. Des pseudonymes sont utilisés par habitude (venant des canaux IRC et/ou de la culture de la demoscene) et aussi pour préserver l’identité des personnes qui le souhaitent (certains participants utilisent également leur nom légal, d’autres pas). lien nᵒ 1 : Dépêche trimestrielle précédente

Mise à jour de haiku-format
À quand la beta 6?
Mise à jour de Go en version 1.18
Le mois de novembre a vu l’arrivée d’une grosse mise à jour de la chaîne d’outils pour le langage Go en version 1.18. Il s’agit d’une version de 2022, mais c’est un gros progrès puisque la version précédente disponible pour Haiku était la version 1.4 datant de 2014. De plus, cette version 1.18 est disponible dans le dépôt de paquets et peut être installée normalement avec pkgman (au moins pour les architectures x86 et x86_64).
La plus grande partie du travail a été réalisée par Korli, depuis plusieurs années, pour mettre en place l’environnement de compilation nécessaire, et aussi corriger de nombreux problèmes de compatibilité POSIX dans Haiku qui ont été mis en évidence par les tests de Go.
Cela permet par exemple d’utiliser Hugo, le générateur de site statique utilisé pour le site principal de Haiku. Waddlesplash a donc pu rédiger et vérifier le rapport d’activité de novembre en utilisant uniquement Haiku : avec Hugo, WebPositive (le navigateur natif de Haiku, basé sur WebKit), l’éditeur de texte Koder, ainsi que Iceweasel (un portage de Firefox) pour la correction d’orthographe.
Redémarrage automatique de app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique de Haiku. Il s’agit d’un composant critique, pour lequel un crash rend le système à peu près inutilisable. Waddlesplash a corrigé plusieurs problèmes dans le code pour permettre de redémarrer le serveur après un crash, et de le reconnecter avec les applications en cours d’exécution. Ce redémarrage nécessite encore quelques étapes manuelles car les crash démarrent actuellement le debugger automatiquement, mais cela peut être changé par une simple configuration.
Applications
ActivityMonitor
ActivityMonitor affiche sous forme graphique divers paramètres du système: charge CPU, consommation mémoire… Il peut s’exécuter dans une fenêtre ou bien être intégré au bureau sous forme d’un « réplicant ».
Affichage d’un message « pas de capteurs de température » à la place du graphe de température du système si l’information n’est pas disponible (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème de localisation, certains fichiers sources n’étaient pas pris en compte et les chaînes contenues dedans ne pouvaient pas être traduites (humdinger).
Terminal
Le Terminal permet d’exécuter des applications en ligne de commande.
Synchronisation du presse-papier interne du Terminal avec celui du système seulement une fois au démarrage de l’application, et pas lors du changement d’onglet comme cela avait été implémenté au trimestre précédent (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème qui masquait le signal SIGUSR1 pour les shells et autres processus lancés dans le terminal (korli).
Implémentation des séquences d’échappement permettant aux applications CLI de définir des liens hypertextes (en complément des liens qui étaient déjà détectés automatiquement par le terminal en fonction du contenu du texte) (korli).
HaikuDepot
HaikuDepot est l’interface graphique du gestionnaire de paquets. Il utilise un backend en ligne en Java pour stocker et récupérer les captures d’écrans, et notes d’utilisateurs, icônes des paquets, liste de paquets mis en avant, et d’autres informations.
L’application est plus robuste en cas de problème de réseau : gestion des erreurs et affichage de messages clairs pour l’utilisateur. Gestion en particulier des erreurs 503 remontées par l’API web utilisée par HaikuDepot (apl).
Ajout de filtres pour trouver facilement les applications « natives » (n’utilisant pas Qt ou GTK) et d’un filtre « desktop » pour trouver les applications graphiques (et filtrer un très grand nombre de paquets de bibliothèques, applications en ligne de commande…) (apl, avec des améliorations par humdinger pour clarifier la terminologie).
Amélioration de la taille de la fenêtre des conditions d’utilisation sur les écrans haute densité (nipos).
Refonte de la gestion des identifiants de messages internes à l’application HaikuDepot pour en simplifier la maintenance (apl).
Interdiction de la sélection multiple dans la liste des paquets (apl).
WebPositive
WebPositive est le navigateur web fourni avec Haiku. Il est basé sur le moteur WebKit, co-développé avec Apple, Sony, Igalia et d’autres participants.
Modification du message envoyé au Tracker pour ouvrir le dossier contenant un fichier (par exemple un téléchargement), pour utiliser le message officiellement prévu à cet effet plutôt qu’un moyen détourné (humdinger).
Meilleure gestion des noms de fichiers longs dans la fenêtre de téléchargements avec l’ajout d’une barre de défilement horizontal (mull, avec un petit correctif par humdinger pour corriger un décalage d’un pixel du positionnement de la barre de défilement).
Un chantier est en cours pour réintégrer à nouveau le portage de WebKit pour Haiku dans les sources upstream. Cela avait déjà été fait en 2010, mais n’avait pas été maintenu par la suite, ce qui a conduit à retirer ce code. Depuis, Haiku utilise un fork resynchronisé régulièrement, mais cela génère du travail en plus. L’envoi du code est aussi l’occasion de faire relire toutes les modifications par les autres développeurs de WebKit, avec des conseils pour améliorer et simplifier l’architecture.
Expander
Expander est une application permettant de décompresser des archives.
Correction d’un décalage d’un pixel de la barre de défilement (humdinger).
AboutSystem
AboutSystem affiche quelques informations sur le système et surtout la liste des auteurs de Haiku.
Simplification du code pour la mise à jour automatique des couleurs, mise en place de la mise à jour automatique des couleurs pour la liste des crédits (si on passe en mode sombre par exemple) (jscipione).
Ouverture de la fenêtre avec une taille respectant les proportions du nombre d’or, esthétiquement plus plaisant (axeld).
LaunchBox
LaunchBox est un « dock » permettant de stocker des raccourcis vers des applications ou fichiers fréquemment utilisés.
Correction de la couleur du panneau de LaunchBox, et d’autres couleurs dans le sélectionneur de couleurs standard (nephele).
Tracker
Tracker est l’explorateur de fichiers. Le code du Tracker contient également les fenêtres « ouvrir » et « enregistrer sous », mises à disposition des autres applications sous forme de la bibliothèque libtracker.so.
Envoi de la notification d’activation de l’espace de travail à tous les réplicants, afin que ces derniers puissent ajuster leur couleur (par exemple) en fonction de l’espace de travail actif (jscipione).
Correction du positionnement du champ de texte lors du renommage de fichiers dans la vue par icônes, résolution de problèmes de gestion de l’état des fenêtres après un glisser-déposer avorté, affichage des volumes disque en premier (avant les dossiers) si l’option « trier les dossiers en premier » est active, synchronisation en direct des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers lors du changement d’options, et divers nettoyages de code (jscipione).
Ajout d’une bordure manquante dans les fenêtres de sélection de fichiers (nipos).
Ajout du nombre d’élément sélectionnés (en plus du nombre d’éléments total du dossier) dans les fenêtres du Tracker (nathan242).
Correction d’un problème de concurrence dans le constructeur des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers, dont la conséquence était une mauvaise disposition des contrôles dans la fenêtre (certains boutons apparaissant superposés par exemple (PulkoMandy).
Amélioration de l’image d’aperçu qui suit la souris lors d’un glisser-déplacer lorsqu’on déplace beaucoup de fichiers: l’image est tronquée pour ne pas être trop grande mais le dégradé de transparence sur les bords n’était pas bien calculé (PulkoMandy).
Déclenchement automatique du « renifleur » de type MIME, qui identifie automatiquement les fichiers pour les afficher avec la bonne icône par exemple. En particulier cela rend l’utilisation du Tracker plus confortable sur les systèmes de fichiers ne permettant pas de stocker le type MIME dans un attribut étendu (Jim906).
Correction d’une régression sur la mise à jour en direct des tailles et dates de modification de fichiers dans les résultats de requêtes (waddlesplash).
MediaPlayer
MediaPlayer est une application pour lire des fichiers média (son et vidéo).
Correction de la couleur du texte dans la fenêtre d’informations (nephele).
Dans cette même fenêtre, le champ indiquant le chemin du fichier en cours de lecture est maintenant cliquable (nathan242, dont c’est la première contribution).
Ajout d’une détection automatique du type MIME des fichiers, s’il n’est pas renseigné (par exemple s’il est stocké sur un système de fichiers où il n’y a pas d’attributs étendus) (DigitalBox98).
Sudoku
Sudoku est un jeu de Sudoku, très utile pour patienter pendant une compilation un peu longue.
Amélioration de la palette de couleurs en mode clair (le mode sombre nécessite encore du travail) (axeld).
DeskBar
DeskBar est la barre des tâches de BeOS et de Haiku. La même application contient également le code pour la fenêtre de changement de tâches « Twitcher ».
Correction d’un bug qui faisait apparaître des applications en double dans le « Twitcher » (la fenêtre de changement rapide d’application qui apparaît avec le raccourci Alt+Tab) (madmax).
People
People est un gestionnaire de contacts. Il stocke les contacts dans des fichiers « person » avec les informations sous forme d’attributs étendus.
Correction du défilement avec la molette de la souris ou au touchpad (nipos).
Lecteur MIDI
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
MidiPlayer
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
Changement de la couleur du contrôle de volume qui était codée en dur, non configurable et pas harmonisée avec le reste du système (nipos).
ProcessController
ProcessController affiche la charge CPU et l’occupation mémoire dans la DeskBar. Il permet également d’afficher des statistiques par application, et de débugger et stopper des applications via un menu popup.
Ajustements pour les écrans haute densité : taille des menus, largeur par défaut de l’icône réplicant, autorisation du redimensionnement de la fenêtre principale (la taille est conservée si on installe ensuite un réplicant sur le bureau, et divers autres changements (waddlesplash).
Installer
Installer permet de cloner l’installation de Haiku actuelle vers un autre disque.
Ajout d’un outil pour copier automatiquement le chargeur de démarrage sur la partition EFI du système, pour réduire le nombre d’étapes manuelles pour installer Haiku correctement sur un système EFI (PawanYr, avec des améliorations de kallisti5 pour nommer le fichier installé correctement en fonction de l’architecture CPU du système).
Amélioration du calcul de la taille de la fenêtre « EULA » de l’installeur (qui affiche non pas un contrat de license, mais un message de bienvenue et quelques instructions pour l’installation), en fonction de la taille de texte sélectionnée dans les préférences (nipos).
Mail
L'application Mail permet de lire et de rédiger des e-mail. Elle fonctionne en collaboration avec le mail_server qui s’occupe de l’envoi et de la réception des messages.
Correction d’une régression sur la couleur de fond des champs d’adresse. Mise en place des mises à jour de couleurs automatiques. Les champs désactivés ou en lecture seule sont maintenant « navigables » (avec la touche tab) et le texte peut être sélectionné et copié (jscipione).
Les boutons « suivant » et « précédent » peuvent être accompagnés de la touche Maj. (Shift), pour changer de message sans modifier le statut « lu » des messages (humdinger).
DriveSetup
DriveSetup permet de configurer les supports de stockage: formatage, partitionnement.
L’application s’affiche sur tous les espaces de travail si la DeskBar n’est pas lancée. Ce cas particulier est utile lors du lancement de l’installation de Haiku, dans ce cas, le bureau n’est pas lancé, mais il est tout de même possible d’utiliser plusieurs espaces de travail, ce qui peut donner l’impression que les fenêtres ont disparu si on se retrouve sur un espace vide (PulkoMandy).
Finalisation d’un patch datant d’il y a plusieurs années pour ajouter un menu permettant d’écrire ou de lire des images disques depuis ou vers des partitions (plus besoin d’utiliser dd en ligne de commande) (sed4096, avec l’aide d’humdinger pour des améliorations de localisation et de choix de vocabulaire).
Debugger
Debugger permet de débugger les logiciels fonctionnant dans Haiku.
Correction d’un crash lorsqu’on essaie de débugger des applications trop grosses, par exemples celle utilisant Mesa et llvmpipe pour faire du rendu 3D (waddlesplash).
Changements transverses
Modification de toutes les chaînes de caractères où le nom d’une application est présent (par exemple : « Deskbar preferences »). En effet, le nom des applications peut optionnellement être traduit, et toutes ces chaînes doivent donc s’adapter dans les deux cas (nom d’application traduit ou conservé en anglais selon les préférences de l’utilisateur). Auparavant ce réglage ne pouvait pas être appliqué de façon systématique (humdinger).
Fenêtres de préférences
Réseau
Affichage de l’état précis des interfaces réseau (en cours de configuration DHCP, par exemple) et pas seulement « hors ligne » ou « en ligne » (nipos).
Périphériques d’entrée
Ajout et amélioration de plusieurs options pour la gestion des touchpad (samuelrp84). Voir plus bas les informations sur la réécriture du pilote Elantech qui donne plus de détails.
Apparence
Envoi d’un seul message de mise à jour aux applications lorsque plusieurs couleurs changent simultanément, ce qui est plus efficace et réduit les « clignotements » d’applications dans certains cas (nephele).
Correction de la hauteur des fausses barres de défilement visibles dans la fenêtre d’apparence pour configurer les barres de défilement (jscipione).
Outils en ligne de commande
Le réplicant NetworkStatus peut être installé dans la DeskBar via la ligne de commande même lorsque une fenêtre de NetworkStatus est déjà ouverte (nipos).
Ajout dans strace de l’affichage des structures stat, sockopt, sigset_t, sigprocmask et des noms de signaux (korli avec un correctif par nathan242).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans l’interface en ligne de commande du Debugger, qui conduisaient entre autres à un gel de l’application. Cette interface est surtout utilisée en cas de crash d’un service critique (app_server, registrar, input_server) qui empêcherait l’utilisation de l’interface graphique. Les investigations sur ces services en cas de crash sont donc facilitées.
Modification de bfs_tools pour rendre ces outils compilables sur le système hôte utilisé pour compiler Haiku (axeld). Ces outils permettent de manipuler à la main un système de fichiers bfs, de récupérer certaines données sur un disque corrompu, et diverses manipulations de bas niveau.
Modification de l’outil makebootable pour vérifier que la partition à rendre bootable est bien une partition BFS. Utiliser l’outil sur une partition d’un autre format ou sur un disque complet pourrait corrompre le système de fichier et rendre les données inaccessibles. Ajout d’un message indiquant lorsque le lancement de makebootable n’est pas nécessaire, car les utilisateurs continuent de recommander de lancer cet outil sans aucune raison pour corriger des problèmes de démarrage (encourageant ainsi les nouveaux utilisateurs à faire dea mauvaises manipulations et à corrompre leur système de fichiers) (PulkoMandy).
Suppression d’une verrue dans checkfs qui n’est plus nécessaire suite à des améliorations du Storage Kit. Cela permet de lancer checkfs pour vérifier une partition en donnant le chemin de n’importe quel fichier contenu dans la partition (waddlesplash).
Activation du support de l’IPv6 dans telnet, implémentation dans netstat (avec des corrections sur les opérateurs de filtrage), et ajout de traceroute6 compilé à partir des sources fournies par NetBSD (cmeerw).
Amélioration de l’affichage de df avec plus d’informations, un listage sur deux lignes, et l’ajout d’une option pour afficher les informations standardisées dans le format imposé par POSIX (nipos et PulkoMandy).
Kits
Interface
L'interface kit se charge de tout l’affichage de fenêtres à l’écran et des contrôles de base (boutons, cases à cocher…)
Correction d’un bug dans le contrôle calendrier lors du déplacement vers les mois suivant ou précédent (nipos).
Correction d’un problème de navigation au clavier dans une ListView après l’insertion de nouveaux objets (nipos).
BControl (la classe parente de tous les contrôles d’interface graphique) ne change plus ses couleurs dans la fonction AttachedToWindow(). Ce n’est plus nécessaire après d’autres changements dans BButton, et cela simplifie le code nécessaire pour personnaliser la couleur d’un contrôle spécifique (pour avoir, par exemple, un bouton rouge) (jscipione).
Améliorations sur BSlider: correction de la couleur du texte, nettoyage du code de dessin des sliders dans les implémentations de ControlLook (jscipione).
Augmentation de la taille des marques sur les boutons des barres de défilement (marques qui ne sont pas activées à moins de modifier manuellement un fichier de configuration) pour les rendre plus visibles sur les hautes résolutions (jscipione).
Les infobulles utilisent un espacement calculé en fonction de la taille du texte, pour une apparence plus jolie sur les écrans à haute densité (waddlesplash).
Séparation du titre des onglets et du nom des vues qui leurs sont attachées. Le comportement original est hérité de BeOS, il est donc préservé pour les anciennes applications. Mais pour les nouvelles applications, le nom interne des vues ne doit pas être traduit (il peut être utilisé par des scripts ou par le code de l’application), tandis que le titre affiché à l’utilisateur doit l’être. C’était le seul endroit où ce principe de séparation du nom et du texte affiché n’était pas respecté (KapiX et PulkoMandy).
Dans BTextView, la fonction « tout sélectionner » déplace le curseur à la fin de la sélection (et à la fin du texte). C’est le comportement de la plupart des autres systèmes, et préserver la position du curseur dans ce cas ne semble pas particulièrement utile (OscarL).
Correction de problèmes de choix de couleurs dans le code qui dessine des sliders avec un curseur triangulaire (nipos). Cette correction a permis d’utiliser ce type de slider dans les fenêtres de réglages de différents traducteurs d’images.
Amélioration de l’apparence des cases à cocher partiellement cochées. Elles s’affichent avec un signe "-" au lieu d’une croix. Auparavant, la couleur était subtilement modifiée mais ce n’était pas très visible (PulkoMandy).
Implémentation de la lecture d’un son dans BAlert, qui peut être activé dans les préférences de son (sed4096).
Storage
Le storage kit permet de contrôler les disques et supports de stockage (liste des partitions, montage et démontage, accès aux fichiers, chemins d’accès, requêtes…)
BPartition retourne une erreur B_BUSY si on essaie de monter une partition qui est déjà montée à un autre endroit, au lieu de la monter une deuxième fois (jscipione).
Device
Le device kit permet l’interaction directe avec certains périphériques (USB, série, joysticks…) directement depuis l’espace utilisateur.
Correction de problèmes de gestion de la mémoire dans BUSBInterface mis en évidence par AtomoZero lors d’expérimentations pour corriger le pilote de webcam à l’aide d’un LLM (waddlesplash).
Package
Le package kit se charge de la résolution des dépendances entre paquets et du téléchargement des paquets à installer. Il fonctionne en collaboration avec le système de fichier packagefs qui permet d’accéder au contenu des paquets une fois installés.
Retravail de BRepositoryCache pour remonter les informations sur les paquets via un callback plutôt que de remplir une structure BPackageInfoSet. Cela économise beaucoup de mémoire et d’allocations mémoire, et rend donc la lecture des dépôts de paquets plus rapide (waddlesplash).
Serveurs
Notifications
Le serveur de notifications permet d’afficher des notifications pour les évènements importants.
Les notifications déjà affichées changent de position immédiatement lorsque la configuration est modifiée pour les déplacer (nipos).
Ajout de la lecture de l’effet sonore choisi dans les préférences de son lors de l’apparition des différents types de notification, et à chaque pourcent de progression pour les notifications contenant une barre de progression (sed4096).
Choix de couleurs plus visibles en mode sombre pour les icônes de fermeture et de repli des notifications en mode sombre (nipos).
Network
Le serveur de réseau se charge de la configuration des interfaces réseau, de la configuration des routes et d’autres aspects liés à la communication en réseau.
Refonte du client DHCP dans net_server pour l’exécuter dans un thread séparé et ne pas bloquer la boucle de messages principale. Cela corrige plusieurs cas de gel du serveur lui-même et d’application qui communiquent avec de façon synchrone, par exemple les préférences de réseau. Cela permet également de plus facilement arrêter les requêtes DHCP lorsqu’une interface est reconfigurée avec une adresse statique (waddlesplash).
app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique gérant l’affichage à l’écran.
Correction de crashs causés par des verrous de concurrence manquants et des opérations effectuées dans le mauvais ordre (waddlesplash).
Retrait d’identifiants de messages qui n’étaient plus utilisés dans le protocole de communication entre les applications et le serveur graphique (X512).
Ajout du code nécessaire pour le tracé de lignes avec un dégradé de couleur (dans app_server et dans BView). Auparavant, les dégradés étaient utilisables uniquement pour le remplissage des formes et pas pour les contours (x512).
Modifications de BPicturePlayer pour utiliser une classe C++ avec de l’héritage plutôt qu’une structure C contenant des pointeurs de fonctions. Cela permet de vérifier que l’interface est implémentée correctement par les différents utilisateurs de cette classe dès la compilation (X512).
Implémentation de méthodes manquantes dans BoundingBox player, une implémentation de BPicturePlayer qui calcule un rectangle assez grand pour contenir tout le dessin réalisé par un objet BPicture rejoué via BPicturePlayer (KapiX).
Retrait d’une optimisation incorrecte dans le traitement des calques avec une opacité globale de 100% dans app_server. Ces calques peuvent tout de même contenir des pixels avec de la transparence, et doivent donc être applatis en tenant compte du canal alpha comme tous les autres calques (KapiX).
Modification du protocole app_server pour l’opération permettant de récupérer les « bounding boxes » pour chaque caractère d’une chaîne. L’interface précédente utilisait un tableau de structures, la nouvelle API est inversée ce qui permet d’envoyer plus efficacement 2 tableaux de types primitifs (X512).
Pilotes de périphériques
Implémentation correcte des timeouts sur les commandes dans le pilote SDHCI, ce qui corrige la compatibilité avec plusieurs lecteurs de cartes SD (PulkoMandy).
Réécriture complète du pilote pour les touchpads Elantech. Cette série de changements retouche tout d’abord la gestion des touchpads en général, avec des améliorations sur la documentation, sur le traitement des données invalides, la configuration par défaut, et un nettoyage du code.
Ensuite, le code pour la reconnaissance de « gestures » a été amélioré pour mieux reconnaître plusieurs mouvements tels que le « tap » pour cliquer, le défilement en faisant glsser 2 doigts sur le touchpad, etc. Les préférences du touchpad ont reçu plusieurs nouvelles cases à cocher pour configurer ces différentes options.
Enfin, la dernière partie du patch met à jour le pilote Elantech pour reconnaître les 4 versions du protocole, dont la dernière est entièrement testée. La version 2 ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant (elle a été désactivée pour l’instant) et les versions 1 et 3 sont activées de façon expérimentale dans les nightly builds en attendant les retours d’utilisateurs (samuelrp84).
Normalisation des noms de volumes générés par le pilote usb_disk pour s’assurer qu’ils ne commencent pas par des espaces (madmax).
Mise à jour de la couche de compatibilité FreeBSD avec FreeBSD 15 et synchronisation de tous les pilotes réseau (ethernet et wifi) concernés avec ceux de FreeBSD 15. Synchronisation du pilote rtl8125 avec OpenBSD (waddlesplash).
Ajout de « quirks » et de code supplémentaire dans le pilote I2C-HID pour essayer de se rapprocher du comportement implémenté dans Linux. Ce pilote ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant et il est désactivé par défaut (Lt-Henry).
Systèmes de fichiers
Ajout d’un bouchon supplémentaire pour une API qui n’a pas besoin d’être implémentée dans userlandfs-FUSE (qui permet l’utilisation de systèmes de fichiers FUSE sous Haiku). Cette modification permet d’utiliser en particulier le système de fichier squashfs-fuse pour accéder à des volumes squashfs (OscarL).
Toujours dans userlandfs-fuse, propagation de l’état « lecture seule » du système de fichier, ce qui permet au Tracker de clairement afficher ces systèmes de fichiers comme étant en lecture seule (fond de fenêtre grisé, désactivation des opérations modifiant les fichiers) (OscarL).
Dans le système de fichiers UDF, amélioration des messages de logs, et correction d’un kernel panic déclenché par une assertion suite à des modifications précédentes dans le VFS (waddlesplash).
Correction d’un double lock dans le pilote FAT qui pouvait déclencher un kernel panic dans de rare cas (Jim906).
Intégration d’une partie des patchs permettant de redimensionner une partition BFS. Ce travail avait été commencé en 2014 dans le cadre du Google Summer of Code mais n’avait pas pu être terminé dans les temps. La série de patch est restée à l’abandon pendant de longues années, mais elle est en train d’être finalisée pour pouvoir en intégrer au moins une première partie (axeld).
Correction d’un bug sur la gestion des timestamps avec un nombre de secondes entier pour BFS. Historiquement dans BeOS, il n’existait pas d’API POSIX pour stocker une date de modification avec une résolution plus fine qu’une seconde. Cela conduisait de très nombreux fichiers à avoir le poids faible de leur date de modification à 0, avec pour conséquence une dégradation de la répartition dans les tables de hachage pour l’exécution de requêtes. Dans ce cas, BFS stocke une valeur aléatoire générée en interne par le système de fichier dans les bits de poids faible. Le bug était que cette valeur pouvait être exposée à l’espace utilisateur, entraînant de mauvais résultats sur la gestion des comparaisons de dates (par exemple pour déterminer les règles à lancer dans un makefile). La représentation interne a été légèrement modifiée pour bien distinguer les fichiers pour lesquels une date précise a été enregistrée, de ceux pour lesquels il s’agit de bits aléatoires. Ces derniers peuvent ainsi être filtrés et masqués pour l’espace utilisateur (PulkoMandy).
Correction de la gestion des dossiers déjà existants dans write_overlay. Ils'agit d’un système de fichier qui permet de stocker en RAM des écritures temporaires sur un système de fichier monté en lecture seule, utilisé en particulier pour l’exécution en mode live CD (nathan242).
Le pilote BTRFS ne déclenche plus un kernel panic lorsqu’il rencontre un type de compression inconnu, à la place, il retourne simplement une erreur et considère que le fichier ou dossier concerné ne peut pas être lu (AbdullahZulfiqar2005).
Des changements sur les requêtes (pour BFS et les autres systèmes de fichiers capables d’exécuter des requêtes): une petite optimisation du code, une modification pour ne pas notifier les suppressions de nœuds via B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL car elles sont déjà notifiées par d’autres moyens. L’API B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL est maintenant considérée comme stable, et a donc été ajoutée dans la documentation officielle (waddlesplash).
libroot &amp; kernel
Réseau
Implémentation des sockets du domaine UNIX de type SOCK_SEQPACKET. Pour ce faire, modifications de recv et send pour accepter des buffers de taille 0 (pour les socket de type datagramme, pas les streams). Implémentation de MSG_TRUNC et MSG_PEEK pour les sockets du domaine UNIX, et amélioration de la gestion des adresses invalides dans accept et recv pour se rapprocher du comportement de Linux et des BSD (korli).
Implémentation de la découverte de MTU de chemin complet pour TCP et IPv4 (waddlesplash) et IPv6 (cmeerw). L’algorithme mis en place est simpliste, mais permet d’établir des communications dans des cas où le MTU est limité et la fragmentation de paquets n’est pas mise en place.
Nettoyage des buffers mémoire utilisés pour stocker des adresses dans le code de gestion du réseau. Cela corrige un comportement incorrect dans le cas où une adresse de socket UNIX n’est pas terminée par un caractère NUL (cas qui est explicitement autorisé sous Linux car l’information de longueur de l’adresse est disponible par ailleurs) (Anarchos pour la correction du cas où la vérification était oubliée, suivi d’un nettoyage par waddlesplash pour avoir une solution plus systématique à tous les endroits où ce cas particulier doit être pris en compte).
Un socket TCP qui est fermé alors que des données sont reçues par le noyau mais pas encore lues par l’application associée renvoie un paquet RST plutôt qu’un FIN. Ceci corrige un problème détecté dans les tests du langage Go. Modification du comportement lors de la réception d’un reset pendant la fermeture d’un socket TCP pour se comporter comme les autres systèmes (korli).
Déplacement du fichier networks utiliser par getnetent dans le dossier data, avec les autres fichiers de configuration du réseau. Il était placé par erreur dans /etc, qui est son chemin habituel pour d’autres systèmes UNIX (PulkoMandy).
Report d’une correction faite par NetBSD dans le résolveur DNS, il manquait une partie de l’initialisation de certains objets dans l’état du résolveur (cmeerw).
Gestion de l’IPv6: correction d’un problème dans la mise à jour du cache pour le protocole NDP (neighbor discovery), implémentation du multicast (cmeerw).
Remplacement des fonctions inet_net_ntop et inet_net_pton par l’implémentation d’OpenBSD, qui est plus respectueuse du standard que celle de NetBSD utilisée auparavant (korli).
Gestion des processus
Autorisation de l’appel de exec() depuis un autre thread que le thread principal du processus, pour se mettre en conformité avec POSIX et corriger un problème avec les outils de compilation d’OCaml (korli).
Préservation des signaux masqués lors de l’appel à fork (korli).
Mise en conformité POSIX des codes d’erreurs retournés dans certains cas dans la gestion des groupes de processus (waddlesplash).
Librairie C standard
Mise en conformité POSIX-2024:
Ajout des fonctions ffsl et ffsll dans strings.h (korli)
Ajout de getresuid(), setresuid(), getresgid(), setresgid() (korli)
Ajout de la déclaration de posix_spawn_file_actions_add[f]chdir dans les en-têtes publics (la fonction était déjà implémentée mais pas déclarée) (waddlesplash)
Synchronisation de l’implémentation de arc4random avec la dernière version d’OpenBSD (korli).
Correction d’un bug dans la gestion des locales, il n’était pas possible de changer seulement certaines catégories (date, format monétaire, messages), tout était forcément dans la même langue (waddlesplash).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans la famille de fonctions strftime (waddlesplash):
ajout des formats %k et %l,
correction sur la gestion des caractères d'espacement Unicode,
correction de problèmes sur la gestion des fuseaux horaires.
Correction de problèmes mineur de compatibilité POSIX: ajout de déclarations de fonctions et de constantes dans search.h, unistd.h, semaphore.h, nettoyage dans limits.h, définition de getlocalename_l… (waddlesplash).
Remplacement de strtok_r par l’implémentation de musl (waddlesplash).
Refonte du stockage et de la gestion des données ctype pour rendre le code plus facile à maintenir, supprimer des indirections inutiles et corriger un problème de thread safety (waddlesplash).
Nettoyage des fonctions de conversions d’encodage de caractères, et correction de la valeur de MB_CUR_MAX pour l’encodage UTF-8 (waddlesplash).
Définition de la constante DEV_BSIZE (mentionnée dans POSIX mais pas obligatoire) dans sys/param.h, modification de tous le code utilisant stat.st_blocks pour utiliser cette constante, y compris des problèmes dans certains systèmes de fichiers qui utilisaient st_blksize à la place. En effet, il n’y a aucun rapport entre la taille de bloc de st_blksize et le nombre de blocs de st_blocks défini juste à côté (waddlesplash).
Gestion de la mémoire
Correction d’une régression du mois précédent sur la gestion des réservations de mémoire lors du découpage d’areas`. Ajout de la possibilité de transférer des réservations de pages pour les caches et areas réservés, pour éviter de réduire les réservations de façon incorrecte. Cela pouvait causer des assertions et des plantages du noyau en particulier lors de l’exécution d’applications utilisant AddressSanitizer (waddlesplash).
Correction d’une fuite de mémoire dans… la gestion de la mémoire, mis en évidence entre autres par l’exécution du compilateur Rust qui consomme beaucoup de mémoire. Au passage, nettoyage du code et des messages de logs dans cette partie du code (waddlesplash).
Entrées-sorties
Modification de la gestion des requêtes d’entrées-sortie pour autoriser les pilotes de périphériques à sous-classer IORequestOwner. En particulier, cela permet au pilote NVMe d’utiliser ces fonctionnalités sans passer par l’ordonnanceur d’I/O générique qui ne se prête pas bien à l’interfaçage de matériel pouvant traiter plusieurs requêtes en parallèle. Cela permet de simplifier du code, supprimer une fonction récursive devenue inutile et finalement corriger un débordement de pile (waddlesplash).
La taille des partitions indiquée dans le bootloader n’était pas correcte : c’était la taille du disque entier qui était affichée à la place (waddlesplash).
Chargeur de démarrage
Correction de l’affichage de caractères unicode dans le menu de démarrage. En particulier cela évite de corrompre l’affichage lors de la navigation dans le système de fichiers pour désactiver certains pilotes de périphériques. Le firmware UEFI utilise de l’UTF16, tandis que le BIOS utilise une page de code IBM non standardisée. Le bootloader utilise en interne de l’UTF-8 et doit donc convertir les caractères dans le bon format dans chaque cas (madmax).
Implémentation du démarrage via le réseau sur les plateformes EFI (avec un peu de nettoyage sur le support réseau dans OpenFirmware et PXE). Cela fonctionne au moins sur l’architecture ARM 32-bit et facilite le développement sur cible réelle: compilation sur une machine, et exécution sur une autre sans devoir entretemps copier le système de fichiers et le bootloader sur une clé USB ou une carte SD (kallisti5 et PulkoMandy).
Un des en-têtes du bootloader utilisait une syntaxe C++, il a été corrigé pour pouvoir être importé depuis du code C si nécessaire (beaglejoe).
Le chargeur EFI ignore les disques qui ont une taille de bloc de 0 octet, ce qui évite une division par zéro lors de tentatives de lire des données (archeYR).
Systèmes de fichiers
Le noyau interdit maintenant de monter plusieurs fois la même partition. Cette vérification avait d’abord été implémentée dans le pilote FAT, puis via une vérification en espace utilisateur, mais ces deux protections étaient insuffisantes et causaient d’autres problèmes (waddlesplash).
Centralisation de plusieurs vérifications au niveau du VFS, par exemple les vérifications de type fichier ou dossier, les modes d’ouverture des fichiers, des codes d’erreurs retournés pour certaines erreurs spécifiques. Ces changements évitent d’avoir des différences de comportement entre différents systèmes de fichiers et s’assurent que le comportement implémenté est bien celui spécifié par POSIX (waddlesplash).
Implémentation de « fallbacks » pour les systèmes de fichiers qui ne savent pas traiter eux-mêmes les opérations SEEK_DATA, SEEK_HOLE et select(), dont en particulier le write_overlay. Cela permet à la commande cp de fonctionner correctement dans ce cas (nathan242).
Outils de debug
Remise en commun de code pour la gestion du MMU dans le chargeur de démarrage EFI. Le code avait été dupliqué pour chaque architecture de CPU supportés, mais il est en fait en très grande partie identique. Regrouper ce code permet de s’assurer que les évolutions sont bien faites de façon synchronisée pour toutes les architectures (PulkoMandy).
Affichage dans le message de kernel panic de la version de Haiku (numéro hrev). Ceci évite de devoir demander ce numéro aux utilisateurs remontant un bug, il est directement inclus dans la capture d’écran de l’erreur (nathan242).
Modification de la valeur retournée par kernel_version dans les informations système. La valeur retournée par Haiku était la version majeure, qui est 1 depuis le début du projet Haiku en 2001. Elle retourne maintenant une version plus complète qui peut être utilisée dans la commande uname pour indiquer la version de Haiku plus précisément (waddlesplash).
Désactivation de la fonction spécifique à BeOS exect sur les architectures qui n’implémentent pas de compatibilité binaire avec BeOS.
Build system
Ajout d’une macro _DEPRECATED dans les en-têtes de base du système, permettant d’indiquer les classes, méthodes et fonctions qui sont obsolètes et à ne plus utiliser. Cela permet d’avoir un avertissement du compilateur lors de leur utilisation dans le code existant, et de commencer à mettre à jour le code, mais sans casser le code déjà écrit pour l’instant. Actuellement, cette macro n’est pas utilisée, des discussions sont encore en cours sur l’opportunité de retirer certaines APIs.
Remise en état des tests pour le bootloader. Ces tests permettent de lancer une partie du bootloader (dont le menu de configuration) sous forme d’un programme s’exécutant sous Haiku. Cela permet de tester une grande partie du code du bootloader sans avoir besoin de redémarrer le système (waddlesplash).
Ajout d’un script pour convertir une disposition de clavier de la console Linux dans le format reconnu par Haiku (mmu_man).
Mise à jour de paquets pour réparer la compilation en mode « bootstrap » (sans dépendances précompilées) pour ARM et ARM64 (PulkoMandy).
Nettoyage et amélioration de la classe utilitaire FunctionTracer qui permet d’afficher facilement une trace de l’exécution de fonctions, avec une indentation indiquant les appels imbriqués. Il existait plusieurs versions de cette classe utilisées à différents endroits dans le code, chacune avec de légères variations. Renommage de fonctions qui pouvaient entrer en conflit avec l’utilisation de debug_printf et modification de cette dernière pour retourner le nombre de caractères imprimés afin de pouvoir l’utiliser de façon interchangeable avec les autres fonctions de la famille printf (PulkoMandy).
Déplacement de plusieurs en-têtes initialement développés pour une utilisation dans le noyau, de headers/private/kernel/util vers headers/private/util, en effet ils implémentent des fonctionnalités assez génériques (listes chaînées, hash tables, opérations sur les bits…) et sont tout à fait utilisables en dehors du noyau (c’est d’ailleurs déjà le cas à plusieurs endroits dans le code de Haiku) (PulkoMandy et waddlesplash).
Retrait de cas ou l’activation de DEBUG=1 (compilation en mode debug avec des assertions supplémentaires) était empêchée pour certains composants du code (waddlesplash).
Modification du code pour inclure les catalogues de traductions automatiquement dans le paquet contenant l’exécutable correspondant. Ce code incluait également les catalogues de toutes les dépendances, ce qui conduisait les catalogues système de libbe.so à être présents plusieurs fois dans plusieurs paquets, occupant inutilement de la place). Ce changement n’est pas tout à fait terminé puisque maintenant certains catalogues ne sont plus inclus du tout (PulkoMandy).
Modernisation de la page d’accueil de WebPositive pour en permettre l’utilisation avec d’autres navigateurs: définition du bon type MIME, utilisation de HTTPS pour télécharger des ressources externes, déclaration de l’encodage du fichier (humbinger).
Modification du « Makefile Engine » pour autoriser des flags de compilation différents entre les fichiers sources C et C++, ce qui permet d’éviter des warnings de compilation dans certains projets compilant des sources C (OscarL).
Il est maintenant possible de compiler Haiku depuis NetBSD (cmeerw).
Réparation de la compilation de test_app_server (KapiX).
Utilisation de la constante B_DEV_NAME_LENGTH plutôt que de la valeur numérique 128 à plusieurs endroits dans le code (jscipione et OscarL).
Suppression de la dépendance du build à la commande bc, en utilisant à la place des expressions arithmétiques du shell POSIX (PulkoMandy).
Réparation de la compilation des tests unitaires, modification des tests utilisant l’interface graphique pour les exécuter avec test_app_server, ajout d’un package haiku_unittests et d’un profil de build qui inclut ce package dans le système de fichier compilé. L’objectif est de pouvoir lancer ces tests automatiquement dans le cadre de l’intégration continue de Haiku (KapiX, à partir d’un travail plus ancien démarré par kallisti5).
Mise à jour de l’année de copyright à 2026 dans le menu de démarrage et dans les métadonnées des paquets générés par Haiku (PulkoMandy).
Mise à jour des paquets précompilés utilisés pour compiler Haiku avec les dernières versions fournies par HaikuPorts pour les architectures x86 et x86_64. L’outil utilisé pour faire cette synchronisation a reçu lui-même quelques évolutions. Le code de Haiku a été légèrement ajusté pour corriger les problèmes de compilation avec ces nouvelles versions des dépendances (waddlesplash, avec l’aide de madmax pour corriger des problèmes de compilation sur RISC-V qui utilise pour l’instant une version plus ancienne de certains paquets).
Documentation
Haiku book
Le « Haiku book » documente les API publiques et s’adresse aux développeurs d’applications pour Haiku. Il complète et remplace petit à petit le Be Book de BeOS, qui est distribué sous une licence CC-BY-ND ne permettant pas de le mettre à jour et de le corriger.
Ajout du chapitre sur le Device Kit (DigitalBox98)
Correction d’une documentation inversée pour un paramètre de BKeyStore (PulkoMandy)
Ajout de documentation pour BSimpleGameSound, BSerialPort, MailAttachment, MailDaemon, mail_encoding (cafeina)
Documentation des déviations connues de Haiku par rapport à la spécification POSIX (PulkoMandy).
Documentation interne
La documentation interne s’adresse aux développeurs et développeuses du système Haiku lui-même.
Correction de fautes de frappe dans le chapitre sur les systèmes de fichiers (OscarL).
Autres nouvelles
Changement de tarification de Netlify
Netlify héberge le site www.haiku-os.org. Ils ont récemment modifié leur tarification pour ajouter un système de crédit en fonction de la bande passante consommée. Haiku bénéficie de l’offre « Open Source », avec une certaine quantité de trafic offerte (en échange de l’affichage d’un logo de Netlify en base de page du site). Cette offre s’est révélée insuffisante dans la nouvelle tarification, surtout suite à une attaque de robots (probablement pour l’entraînement de LLM de mauvaise qualité, puisque ils requêtaient des pages n’existant pas et n’obtenaient que des erreurs 404). Du côté de Haiku, des protections ont été mises en place pour éviter ce genre de problème, mais entretemps, Netlify a facturé le dépassement de bande passante autorisée pour le mois de décembre.
Finalement, après une discussion avec l’équipe de support de Netlify et une vérification de ce qu’il s’était passé, la facture a été annulée, et la consommation de bande passante pour Haiku a été augmentée pour mieux convenir à l’utilisation habituelle générée par Haiku.
Remise sur les rails de HSA (Haiku Support Association)
Actuellement, l’association Haiku inc est la principale organisation recevant des dons et finançant les activités de Haiku (développeur employé, coût d’hébergement de l’infrastructure…).
Cette association est basée aux USA, ce qui est récemment devenu une source d’inquiétude pour certains contributeurs et donateurs de Haiku.
Suite à une discussion sur les forums, il y a donc un regain d’intérêt pour la Haiku Support Association, une autre organisation basée en Allemagne et qui était dormante depuis plusieurs années. Plusieurs personnes ont donc adhéré à cette association et cela va peut-être permettre d’en relancer l’activité et d’assurer une présence en Europe.
En particulier, c’est cette association qui organisait la conférence BeGeistert et le traditionnel « coding sprint » associé, permettant aux développeurs et aux utilisateurs de Haiku de se rencontrer régulièrement. Cette activité avait cessé suite au manque de public pour ces évènements, à une perte d’intérêt des membres de l’association, et une absence de nouveaux adhérents pour relancer les choses. Espérons que cette période d’inactivité soit maintenant terminée et que l’organisation de conférences plus régulières puisse reprendre.

linux, permanence, dépannage, formation, adieu-windows, libres, logiciels-libres, abcpc, prends-toi-en-main, install-party [Internet] Mapathon 2025-2026 par CartONG – Le lundi 9 février 2026 de 18h00 à 20h00.
Vous voulez vous engager pour une cause, rencontrer de nouvelles personnes et découvrir la cartographie participative et humanitaire? CartONG vous invite à participer à un ou plusieurs mapathons en ligne! ​​
Venez cartographier les régions encore absentes des cartes pour soutenir les organisations humanitaires et de solidarité internationale qui ont besoin de cartes précises et à jour pour agir plus efficacement en cas de crise ou initier des projets de développement local.
Les ateliers de cartographie sont organisés dans le cadre du projet Missing Maps, qui a pour objectif de cartographier de façon préventive les régions vulnérables aux catastrophes naturelles, crises sanitaires, environnementales, aux conflits et à la pauvreté. On peut penser qu’aujourd’hui toutes les parties du monde sont cartographiées, mais en réalité de nombreuses régions ne possèdent encore aucune carte!
​ Pour qui? Pas besoin d’être un·e expert·e, les ateliers sont accessibles à tout le monde!
​ Où ? 100% en ligne! Un lien de connexion vous sera envoyé après votre inscription
​ ? Avec la plateforme de cartographie libre et contributive OpenStreetMap (OSM, le «Wikipédia des cartes») tout le monde peut participer à la cartographie de n’importe quelle zone de la planète: il suffit d’un ordinateur, d’une souris et d’une connexion internet! Accessibles à tout·es, nous serons là pour vous accompagner pour vos premiers pas avec OSM.
Le programme des mapathons
18h00: Introduction, présentation de la cartographie collaborative et solidaire et démonstration OSM pour les nouveaux·elles
18h30: On cartographie tous ensemble sur un projet
20h00: Fin du mapathon, conclusion sur les contributions de la soirée

gull, paulla, logiciels-libres, projets, futur, assemblée-générale [FR Paris] Soirée de contribution au libre – Le jeudi 12 février 2026 de 19h30 à 22h00.
Le but des soirées de contribution au libre est de proposer un espace de travail partagé aux personnes actives dans le libre en Île-de-France le temps d’une soirée, une fois par mois (le deuxième jeudi du mois plus précisément).
Dit plus court: c’est un lieu avec de l’électricité et une connexion internet. En avant les claviers !
Les soirées de contribution au libre sont faites pour vous si:
vous travaillez sur un projet libre et vous recherchez une atmosphère à la fois conviviale et studieuse pour aller de l’avant et, qui sait, créer des connexions avec d’autres projets libres, vous êtes un collectif autour du libre et vous cherchez un lieu pour vous retrouver physiquement et avancer avec efficacité sur vos chantiers. Si vous n’avez pas envie de contribuer à un projet libre, les soirées de contribution au libre ne sont sans doute pas faites pour vous. Pas de panique, Parinux organise d’autres évènements:
si vous voulez discuter autour du libre: l’Apéro du Libre (APL) est là pour ça ; c’est un rendez-vous fixé tous les 15 du mois ; venez-nous retrouver autour d’un verre pour papoter et refaire le monde (libre), si vous avez un problème informatique: c’est la vocation de Premiers Samedi du Libre (PSL) où vous pourrez trouver des oreilles attentives et compétentes à l’écoute de toutes vos questions. Nous nous réservons le droit de refuser l’entrée aux soirées de contribution au libre à tout personne qui n’en respecterait pas l’esprit. Et, bien sûr, les règles de bienséance habituelles s’appliquent pour que chacune et chacun se sente à l’aise dans un cadre bienveillant.
Si les soirées de contribution vous intéressent, le mieux est de contacter d’abord le CA de Parinux ca@parinux.org. Vous devrez de toute façon nous écrire pour obtenir le code de la porte cochère…

Rencontre mensuelle autour des logiciels libres, en toute simplicité.
Ces matinées seront ce que nous en ferons ensemble, selon vos attentes:
Découverte des logiciels libres dont Linux et de leur intérêt. Utilisation sur place.
Installations, sur votre machine (pensez à sauvegarder vos données avant de venir avec) ou sur des PC fournis pour apprendre ensemble sans risque. Parfois, on vous propose un ordinateur auquel Linux a redonné une seconde vie, avec lequel vous pouvez repartir…
Préparation d’une clé USB pour tester Linux chez vous, l’installer ou alors pour utiliser des logiciels libres sans installation sous Windows.
Entraide, suivi de votre expérience avec les logiciels libres.
Nous pourrons aussi nous intéresser aux outils en ligne, aux smartphones, ou nous amuser à redonner vie à de vieux PC un peu obsolètes, à reconditionner des ordinateurs pour des associations ou personnes avec peu de ressources, etc.
Pour tout projet qui risque de prendre un peu de temps, il est préférable de nous contacter avant.
Les débutant·e·s sont les bienvenu·e·s! Les autres aussi, bien évidemment !

**Source:** GitHub Trending Python | **Keyword:** `GitHub`
Evals is a framework for evaluating LLMs and LLM systems, and an open-source registry of benchmarks. OpenAI Evals You can now configure and run Evals directly in the OpenAI Dashboard. Get started → Evals provide a framework for evaluating large language models (LLMs) or systems built using LLMs. We offer an existing registry of evals to test different dimensions of OpenAI models and the ability to write your own custom evals for use cases you care about. You can also use your data to build private evals which represent the common LLMs patterns in your workflow without exposing any of that data publicly. If you are building with LLMs, creating high quality evals is one of the most impactful things you can do. Without evals, it can be very difficult and time intensive to understand how different model versions might affect your use case. In the words of OpenAI's President Greg Brockman: Setup To run evals, you will need to set up and specify your OpenAI API key. After you obtain an API key, specify it using the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. Please be aware of the costs associated with using the API when running evals. You can also run and create evals using Weights &amp; Biases. Minimum Required Version: Python 3.9 Downloading evals Our evals registry is stored using Git-LFS. Once you have downloaded and installed LFS, you can fetch the evals (from within your local copy of the evals repo) with: cd evals
git lfs fetch --all
git lfs pull This will populate all the pointer files under evals/registry/data. You may just want to fetch data for a select eval. You can achieve this via: git lfs fetch --include=evals/registry/data/${your eval}

### 30. `EN` [LIVO Next-Level Flutter State Management](data/articles/fbb035f43b01b83b5ef59d8bf7d13b2f.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
Flutter is great, but managing state can quickly become messy. You’ve probably used setState for small projects or Provider, Riverpod, or BLoC for bigger apps—but each comes with trade-offs.
**** Note: This story was originally about reactive_orm, which is now deprecated. Its evolution is now called LIVO. LIVO continues its reactive object-relationship state management approach with improved naming, documentation, and long-term support.
. What is LIVO?
Enter LIVO: a lightweight, reactive ORM-style state management library for Flutter.
It lets your UI react automatically when model properties change — no streams, ChangeNotifier, or boilerplate required.
. With LIVO, you get:
Object-wise and field-wise reactivity
Nested and shared models
Many → One and Many Many relationships
Minimal boilerplate, plain Dart models
. LIVO in action:
Object-wise: Update any field and rebuild the entire widget
Field-wise: Only rebuild widgets for selected fields
Many → One: Multiple models feeding a single observer
Many Many: Shared models reflected across multiple parents
. Getting Started:
livo: 1⃣ Creating a Reactive Model
_import 'package:livo/livo.dart';
class Task extends ReactiveModel {
Task({required String title}) : _title = title;
String get title =&gt; _title;
bool get completed =&gt; _completed;
String get status =&gt; status; This is just plain Dart. LIVO will handle notifying widgets when fields change.
2⃣ Object-wise Reactivity
_final objectWise = Task(title: "Object-wise Reactivity");
ReactiveBuilder(
Here, checking the checkbox triggers a rebuild of the entire widget.
3⃣ Field-wise Reactivity (Optimized)
Sometimes, you only want specific fields to trigger a rebuild:
_final fieldWise = Task(title: "Field-wise Reactivity");
ReactiveBuilder(
4⃣ Many → One (Aggregation)
Combine multiple models into a single reactive observer:
_class Dashboard extends ReactiveModel {
Dashboard(this.sources) {
final manyA = Task(title: "Task A");
ReactiveBuilder(
) =&gt; Column( Updating manyA or manyB automatically rebuilds the dashboard widget.
5⃣ Many Many (Shared Models)
Models can be shared across multiple parents, keeping the UI in sync everywhere:
_class Group extends ReactiveModel {
Group({required this.name, required this.tasks}) {
final group1 = Group(name: "Group 1", tasks: [objectWise, fieldWise]);
ReactiveBuilder(
Models extend ReactiveModel
Field setters call notifyListeners(#field) whenever a value changes
ReactiveBuilder widgets listen to either the whole object or specific fields
Nested models propagate changes upward automatically
No streams. No manual wiring. Everything updates safely and efficiently. Why LIVO
Clean Dart models with minimal boilerplate
Fine-grained reactivity for optimized performance
ORM-style mental model for easier app design
Works seamlessly for single fields, nested models, or shared models Links
Pub Package: LIVO
GitHub Repository Tip for Readers
LIVO makes Flutter state management intuitive and fun — without sacrificing performance.

### 31. `EN` [Bmalph: BMAD planning + Ralph autonomous loop, glued together in one command](data/articles/0ee112c13ae342f8b287452d2060d8b6.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
I built Bmalph because I kept running into the same problem: AI coding assistants are great at writing code, but terrible at remembering why you made a decision three features ago. You re-explain context, the architecture drifts, things contradict each other. For small projects that's fine. For anything real, it's a slow disaster.
bmalph is a CLI that combines two great existing open source projects: BMAD-METHOD for structured AI planning, and Ralph for autonomous implementation. One command installs and wires them together in your project.
Until last week it only worked with Claude Code. That's changed.
The core idea is simple: separate thinking from doing. Phases 1-3 (BMAD — Planning)
Before any code gets written, you work interactively with specialized AI agents: an Analyst, a Product Manager, and an Architect. They guide you through producing a product brief, a PRD, UX specs, architecture decisions, and user stories. The AI asks questions. You make decisions. Nothing moves forward without your input.
The output is a set of real planning documents that live in your repo under _bmad-output/. Not chat history. Not a summary in your clipboard. Actual files that persist.
Phase 4 (Ralph — Implementation)
Once planning is done, Ralph takes those docs and implements them autonomously. It picks the next story from @fix_plan.md, writes tests first, implements the code, commits, and moves on to the next story. You don't babysit it. The loop runs until the board is empty or the circuit breaker trips.
The key thing Ralph has that vanilla Claude Code doesn't: a persistent spec. When it implements story 8, it still knows what was decided in story 1 because the planning docs are right there.
The initial release assumed Claude Code. That was limiting. This release adds support for six platforms across two tiers. Platform
Tier
What you get Claude Code
Full
Phases 1-4, BMAD + Ralph loop OpenAI Codex
Full
Phases 1-4, BMAD + Ralph loop Cursor
Instructions-only
Phases 1-3, BMAD planning only Windsurf
Instructions-only
Phases 1-3, BMAD planning only GitHub Copilot
Instructions-only
Phases 1-3, BMAD planning only Aider
Instructions-only
Phases 1-3, BMAD planning only The tier split comes down to one thing: whether the platform exposes a scriptable CLI. Ralph is a bash loop that spawns fresh AI sessions, so it needs claude or codex in your PATH. Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, and Aider don't work that way, so they get the planning workflow only.
That said, Phases 1-3 alone are where most of the thinking happens. If you're on an instructions-only platform you still get the full BMAD workflow: analysts, PRDs, architecture, epics, stories.
Platform detection is automatic. Run bmalph init and it figures out which platform you're using from project markers. Or pass --platform explicitly.
npm install -g bmalph # auto-detect
bmalph init # or be explicit
bmalph init --platform codex
bmalph init --platform cursor This comes up a lot so let me be direct about it.
Just prompting Claude Code / Cursor / Copilot directly
Fine for small tasks. A bug fix, a component, a quick script. bmalph is overkill for that. If you're reaching for bmalph on a weekend project you're over-engineering your workflow.
Where it breaks down is anything with multiple moving parts spanning more than a few sessions. The AI has no memory of earlier decisions, you end up re-explaining context constantly, and the architecture slowly drifts into something nobody planned.
BMAD-METHOD standalone
BMAD is great but setting it up manually in each project is friction. bmalph bundles and installs it with one command, keeps it versioned, and wires it to Ralph. If you're already using BMAD standalone, bmalph init is essentially a migration path — it preserves your _bmad-output/ artifacts.
Devin, SWE-agent, and other fully autonomous systems
Different category. Those are trying to do everything autonomously from a single prompt. bmalph keeps you in the loop during planning — you're making decisions with the AI agents, not handing off a spec and waiting. Ralph only takes over once you've explicitly approved the plan and triggered the implementation.
Earlier versions had version drift issues where the bundled BMAD could get out of sync. That's fixed. The bundled version is now pinned, tested, and the upgrade path is clean.
bmalph upgrade This updates the bundled BMAD and Ralph assets without touching _bmad-output/ — your planning artifacts are never overwritten.
A few things on the roadmap:
Story-level diff summary. After each story, Ralph automatically generates a readable summary of what changed, which files were touched, and whether tests passed. Right now that's buried in raw logs.
Automatic context regeneration. When Ralph gets stuck, the circuit breaker detects it and stops. Instead: automatically run GPC (Generate Project Context) and refresh the context before the next iteration.

### 32. `FR` [Des projets open source se révoltent contre les codes "non humains" et veulent fixer des règles et des limites](data/articles/61cb79a5767da598a827ccc7d0f7b0b9.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Plusieurs projets open source ne veulent plus voir de code généré par des agents et autres pratiques de « vibe coding ». Par exemple, Widelands, un jeu open source de stratégie en temps réel, a annoncé le 24 février le blocage des contenus générés par une IA, un agent ou tout autre outil d’IA. "L'équipe de développement de Widelands rédige une résolution visant à refuser les contributions de contenu généré par l'IA (code, graphismes, musique, etc.) au code source et aux dépôts du jeu. Nous estimons que le contenu généré par l'IA est généralement problématique sur les plans éthique et juridique, car il viole les droits d'auteur des créateurs dont les œuvres ont été utilisées pour l'entraînement de l'IA sans leur autorisation et sans mention de leur nom. De plus, nous constatons qu'il est souvent de faible qualité et/ou trop générique, et qu'il ne répond pas aux exigences spécifiques de Widelands. Les demandes de fusion générées par l'IA pourront être fermées sans examen. Widelands est créé par des humains, pour des humains."
Le projet fixe donc des limites sur ce qui est autorisé ou non. Ainsi, les extensions et la documentation sont exclues de cette résolution anti-IA.
L’Electronic Frontier Foundation n'est pas opposée au code généré ni à l'IA en général, mais la fondation veut des règles claires et fixer des limites. Ainsi, dans ses nouvelles politiques, les contributions générées par une IA (au sens global du terme) doivent respecter plusieurs principes : Veuillez vous abstenir de soumettre des contributions que vous n’avez pas parfaitement comprises, examinées et testées. Veuillez indiquer si votre contribution a été générée par une IA. Les descriptions et doivent être rédigés par vos soins. Les responsables du projet peuvent déterminer si les contributions ne sont pas raisonnablement examinables. Il est intéressant de noter qu'ici, l'EFF veut imposer de bonnes pratiques. Le développeur doit comprendre le code généré et ne pas lui faire une confiance absolue, ni le soumettre sans aucune revue. Pour obliger le développeur à lire le code généré, l'EFF veut que les soient rédigés par le développeur lui-même.
Le moteur Godot est dans la même situation et avertit que les PR déposées sont de plus en plus générées par une IA et, à force, cela épuise les mainteneurs. L'alerte est venue de Rémi Verschelde. Un autre développeur, Adriaan, va plus loin et critique même le sens de nombreuses requêtes : "Le dépôt GitHub de Godot est saturé de demandes de fusion générées par des développeurs débutants, ce qui représente une perte de temps considérable pour les relecteurs – surtout si cela n'est pas signalé. Les modifications sont souvent incompréhensibles, les descriptions sont excessivement verbeuses et les utilisateurs eux-mêmes ne comprennent pas leurs propres modifications… C'est un véritable désastre."
Dans la communauté Blender, le problème est identique et une réglementation sur les contributions IA est discutée :
"On observe une augmentation des demandes de fusion générées par l'IA, sans que cela soit clairement indiqué, et dont l'auteur ne comprend pas toujours pleinement la contribution. La revue de code et la maintenance ont toujours constitué un goulot d'étranglement majeur. Lorsque les contributions de l'IA ne sont pas entièrement comprises par le contributeur lui-même, la charge de travail des relecteurs s'en trouve encore alourdie. Dans le pire des cas, les relecteurs communiquent avec l'IA par un jeu du téléphone arabe.
Il est important de former les nouveaux développeurs pour faire évoluer le projet, même lorsqu'il aurait été plus rapide pour le relecteur d'effectuer lui-même les modifications (avec ou sans IA). C'est pourquoi les relecteurs devraient savoir s'ils collaborent avec un humain, afin de pouvoir décider du moment opportun pour fournir cet effort.
Par ailleurs, la revue de code assistée par l'IA et les vérifications basées sur nos directives peuvent potentiellement alléger la charge de travail des relecteurs, contribuer à la correction des bogues et à l'amélioration de la stabilité."
Le projet open source Coolify dit exactement la même chose : trop de PR de mauvaise qualité ou incompréhensibles. Le mainteneur a mis en place une GitHub Action pour détecter une PR trop mauvaise ou générée par une IA. Résultat : 98 % des PR pourraient être fermées automatiquement...
Notre : trop d'IA tue l'IA ? Pas exactement, mais on constate depuis quelques semaines une volonté croissante de projets open source d'agir pour préserver la qualité du code et surtout éviter les requêtes inutiles générées par une IA, sans que la personne comprenne réellement le sens de la demande ni le code soumis. Et c'est là le véritable problème. L'objectif n'est pas de bannir l'IA, mais d'encadrer son usage et de responsabiliser les développeurs. Catégorie actualité: IA Godot, IA Image actualité AMP:

Utilisateur de Canoprof depuis 2019, cet outil est devenu un des piliers de ma pratique d’enseignement en Physique-Chimie (4ᵉ, 5ᵉ, 3ᵉ) et en Sciences (6ᵉ). Je l’utilise pour concevoir l’ensemble de mes supports aussi bien papier que numériques, ce qui me permet de maintenir une cohérence didactique forte sur l’ensemble du cursus collège.
La force de Canoprof réside dans la séparation claire entre le contenu et la forme. En tant qu’enseignant, cela me permet de me concentrer sur le fond pédagogique et la structuration de mes séquences, sans perdre de temps dans les contraintes techniques de mise en page. La richesse de mon fond documentaire, construit depuis plus de six ans, évolue ainsi sereinement au fil des réformes et de mes retours d’expérience.
Canoprof m’aide à formaliser une progression spiralaire efficace tout en générant des supports propres, structurés et accessibles. C’est un gain de productivité précieux qui me permet de consacrer plus d’énergie à l’accompagnement de mes élèves en classe.

### 37. `EN` [I Built a Free Statistics Calculator with Next.js — Here's What I Learned](data/articles/ed637843b0f43660166401203b8ac547.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
As a developer who also does research, I got tired of switching between SPSS, R, and Excel just to run basic statistical tests. So I built StatMate — a free, browser-based statistics calculator that handles 20 different tests and outputs APA-formatted results.
Here's the story of how I built it and what I learned along the way.
Every semester, thousands of students and researchers face the same struggle:
SPSS costs $100+/month
R has a steep learning curve
Excel can't format APA tables automatically
Online calculators only handle one test at a time
I wanted to build something that just works — paste your data, pick a test, get properly formatted results.
Next.js 16 with Turbopack for fast builds
TypeScript for type-safe statistics calculations
Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
next-intl for trilingual support (English, Korean, Japanese)
All statistics computed client-side in the browser — no data leaves your machine
StatMate currently supports 20 statistical tests:
Parametric: t-tests (independent, paired, one-sample), ANOVA (one-way, two-way, repeated measures), simple &amp; multiple regression, logistic regression
Non-parametric: Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, Friedman
Other: Chi-square, Fisher's exact, McNemar, correlation, descriptive stats, sample size/power, Cronbach's alpha, factor analysis (EFA)
Every test includes:
APA 7th edition formatted results — copy-paste ready
Assumption checks (normality, homogeneity of variance)
Interactive charts (box plots, scatter plots, residual plots)
PDF export (free) and Word/DOCX export (Pro)
Example data so users can try before entering their own
No external stats library — I wrote all 20 statistical modules in TypeScript. The trickiest parts:
Matrix operations for factor analysis (eigenvalue decomposition, varimax rotation)
Probability distributions (t, F, chi-square) using series approximations
Post-hoc tests (Bonferroni, Tukey HSD, Dunn's test)
I validated every calculator against R 4.3 to ensure accuracy.
APA 7th edition has very specific formatting rules. Each test has its own reporting format:
t(58) = 2.45, p = .017, d = 0.63
F(2, 87) = 4.12, p = .019, partial eta-squared = .086 Building a system that automatically generates these strings with correct rounding, italics handling, and effect size interpretation was more work than expected.
Translating a statistics app into 3 languages isn't just about UI text. Statistical terminology, APA conventions, and number formatting all vary by locale. next-intl handled most of it, but edge cases required custom logic.
Client-side computation is underrated. Users trust a tool more when their data never leaves the browser.
APA formatting is a product feature, not a nice-to-have. It's the #1 thing users mention.
Trilingual from day one opened up markets I wouldn't have reached otherwise.
Free tools need a Pro tier to be sustainable. Ours includes AI-powered result interpretation and DOCX export.
StatMate is live at statmate.org. Everything is free — 20 calculators, PDF export, assumption checks, and charts.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Electrobun est une nouvelle solution pour développer des apps desktops en TypeScript. Il se veut léger, rapide et basé sur Zig et Bun. Il permet un binding écrit en C++, Zig, le backend est assuré par Bun, et il est multiplateforme (macOS, Windows et Linux). Il a l'ambition de créer des binaires les plus petits possibles, un temps de démarrage très bas et 100 % natif pour l'interface. Electrobun se veut une meilleure réponse qu'Electron. On écrit le coeur de l'application en TypeScript avec des WebView, les deux ensembles sont isolés et communiquent en RPC. Attention, il faut un environnement de développement desktop complet :
- Xcode + cmake sur macOS
- Visual Studio Build Tools our Visual Studio avec les extensions C++ et cmake sur Windows
- webkit2gtk et les paquets GTC, cmake et paquet build-essantial sur Linux

### 40. `FR` [Rasbperry Pi vs ESP32 : vraies questions, mauvaises comparaisons](data/articles/7729596402dd86a5e4c8d4e5b5113ccc.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Raspberry Pi vs ESP32 vs Arduino, cette question revient régulièrement quand on choisit la bonne plateforme pour son projet IoT. Comme nous le disons souvent quand nous comparons les platesformes, il faut comparer ce qui est comporable. Il ne faut pas opposer une Raspberry Pi 5 avec une ESP32. La Pi est une SBC, une Single Board Computer. Il s'agit donc d'un véritable micro-ordinateur sur une unique carte. Elle contient toute l'électronique (SoC, mémoire, vidéo, audio, stockage, réseau). Et une Pi 5 a besoin d'une alimentation puissante et d'un OS. L'ESP32 repose sur un firmware, qu'il est possible de changer.
L'autre différence est le form factor. La Pi 5 exige de la place et une dissipation thermique active pour les fortes charges.
La Pi 5 fait 8,5 cm sur 4,9 cm contre 5,5 cm sur 2,6 cm pour une ESP32 WROOM-32 (qui n'est pas le modèle le plus petit). L'ESP32 pourrait se comparer à la Pi Pico 2 avec 5,1 cm sur 2,1 cm. Nous ne tenons pas compte de la hauteur des headers.
L'équivalent d'une ESP32 côté Pi est donc la Pi Pico 2, aussi bien par le positionnement, le hardware et le form factor.
Petite comparaison : les specs Pi Pico 2 : un SoC RP235x + cœurs ARM, 520 Ko de SRAM, 4 Mo de stockage, 26 GPIO, UART / SPI / I2C, USB, réseau sans fil selon le modèle. De 6 à 9 € selon le modèle. - ESP32 Wroom32 : SoC ESP32, 512 Ko de RAM, 4 Mo de stockage, 34 GPIO, SPI / I2C / CAN / UART, WiFi + Bluetooth, env. 7-9 € Si vous êtes habitué(e) à coder avec Arduino, vous pouvez sans problème coder depuis l’Arduino IDE, les ESP sont parfaitement supportés. Vous pourrez utiliser peu ou prou les mêmes capteurs. Si vous cherchez une carte réactive avec des interruptions plus rapides, le Pi Pico 2 est souvent considéré comme meilleur. L’ESP32 propose plus de protocoleset de GPIO. Sur la partie connectivité sans fil, les deux cartes supportent le Wi-Fi et le Bluetooth, mais petit avantage à l’ESP32, car le réseau sans fil est une des fonctionnalités intégrées dès la conception. Et le support OTA (mise à jour over the air) peut être un avantage certain dans un contexte contraint ou industriel.
L’ESP32 est plus consommatrice, notamment en charge maximale. La Pi Pico 2 est plus économique. Si vous cherchez avant tout la basse consommation, la Pi sera sans doute la meilleure option.
Sur le modèle de développement, nous avons toujours apprécié la diversité de l’ESP32. Si vous voulez faire du MicroPython, vous devrez flasher le bon firmware. Catégorie actualité: Hardware Raspberry pi, ESP32 Image actualité AMP:

### 41. `FR` [Physiocab : un logiciel libre de gestion pour kinésithérapeutes](data/articles/e0eab329ba8752732324b8914ae82b51.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Physiocab est un logiciel libre de gestion de cabinet de kinésithérapie, développé sous licence Affero GPL 3.0 et hébergé sur Codeberg. Le projet est porté par la société Allium SAS, dans le cadre de la plateforme communautaire Kalinka, dédiée aux kinésithérapeutes francophones.
Le projet vient de passer en beta publique (v0.9) et cherche des testeurs et contributeurs.
Pourquoi un logiciel libre pour les kinés ? Le secteur de la santé libérale souffre d'une offre logicielle dominée par des solutions propriétaires onéreuses, souvent opaques sur le traitement des données de santé. Physiocab propose une alternative : un code auditable, des données stockées localement sous la responsabilité du praticien. lien nᵒ 1 : La page de présentation du projet
lien nᵒ 2 : Le dépôt codeberg
lien nᵒ 3 : PeerJs (MIT) Fonctionnalités
La beta couvre déjà un large périmètre fonctionnel :
Planning hebdomadaire en drag &amp; drop, avec export PDF et gestion des semaines exceptionnelles, particulièrement orienté vers les kinés intervenant en multi-établissements.
Bilans Diagnostiques Kinésithérapiques (BDK) avec tests standardisés (TUG, Tinetti, Handgrip, EVA, évaluation du risque de chute…), export de PDF et historique comparatif.
Suivi des séances avec de multiples exercices structurés (équilibre, force, endurance, mobilisation), chronométrage automatique et calcul de progression.
Application tablette en PWA : fonctionne hors connexion grâce à un Service Worker, s'installe sans passer par un store, interface optimisée tactile.
Stack technique
Backend : Python 3.10+
L'application est multi-plateforme côté client (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). La communication entre l'appli de bureau et l'appli PWA se fait de manière directe via PeerJs. Cette méthode ne nécessite pas de préparation contraignante comme l'ouverture de ports.
Les données sont stockées localement, ce qui implique que le praticien reste maître de ses sauvegardes et de sa conformité RGPD.
Le logiciel a été testé par un kinésithérapeute en situation réelle plusieurs jours d'affilée.
Modèle économique
L'utilisation est gratuite, sans limite dans le temps et sans frais cachés, la licence Affero GPL 3.0 en étant la garantie. Un support payant sur devis est proposé pour les praticiens souhaitant une installation assistée, une formation à distance, des développements sur mesure ou un audit de sécurité.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) vient de publier une mise à jour substantielle de sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre. L’agence confirme que le logiciel libre et la transparence sont essentiels à la sécurité des systèmes d’information. Elle assume sa contribution au libre et la publication de logiciels sous licence libre.
Cette posture très favorable au logiciel libre et open source est une belle avancée et un signal fort. Jusque-là, la posture de l’ANSSI était beaucoup plus floue et sa contribution à des projets libres et open source pouvait même apparaitre en contradiction avec sa doctrine. J’avais l’impression que les collaborateurs de l’ANSSI qui le faisaient reprenaient à leur compte le dicton « Pour vivre heureux, vivons cachés ».
La politique de l’agence est désormais claire : l’ANSSI contribue, l’ANSSI publie, l’ANSSI a une stratégie pragmatique qui peut l’amener à s’engager ou non sur le long terme en fonction de la finalité de l’outil et des motivations de l’ANSSI.
Détail qui a son importance, l’ANSSI indique privilégier, sauf exception justifiée, la licence Apache v2.0 pour les projets qu’elle publie. Je suis ravi de voir ce service privilégier une licence mondialement connue à une licence franco-française ou européenne (elles ont le don de doucher nombre de velléités d’utilisation et de contribution). lien nᵒ 1 : L’ANSSI met à jour sa politique open source (9 février 2026)

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Oracle avait profité de la FOSDEM 2026 pour mettre en avant MySQL avec un événement dédié "MySQL and friends". L'éditeur en profitait pour affimer que des fonctionnalités réservées aux versions payantes allaient bientôt rejoindre la version communautaire, notamment, les fonctions autour des vecteurs. Oracle parlait d'une nouvelle ère. Oracle cherchait à relancer les relations avec la communauté open source et rassurer sur l'avenir de mySQL. MariaDB a rapidement réagi : ""MariaDB a passé des années à livrer des innovations qui ont forcé Oracle à mettre à jour MySQL – des analyses en colonnes à la réplication avancée parallèle, en passant par le lancement de la recherche vectorielle native l'an dernier. Nous n'avons pas attendu le moment opportun pour ouvrir la porte à ces avancées ; nous les avons intégrées au cœur de notre serveur, car c'est ce que requiert une base de données open source moderne. Les utilisateurs MySQL ont désormais un choix clair : rester avec un éditeur qui n'innove que sous la contrainte, ou rejoindre MariaDB, qui se consacre à 100% à l'avenir. Puisque MariaDB devient l'option simple pour migrer depuis MySQL, sécuriser l'avenir de votre stack n'est plus qu'à un clic."
Il faut dire que la MySQL n'avait pas évolué depuis l'automne 2025 et qu'aucune communication claire n'avait été faite par Oracle sur l'avenir de la base de données. Il y a quelques jours, une lettre ouverte a été publiée pour demander à Oracle un changement de gouvernance : créer une gouvernance indépendante sous la forme d'une fondation pour reprendre en main MySQL et retrouver une stratégie claire. Les défis sont nombreux :
- une popularité en baisse constante
- manque de transparence sur le projet
- une version communautaire incomplète
- une partie des équipes transférées au cloud d'Oracle
La nouvelle gouvernance pourrait aider à relancer la confiance, définir une roadmap claire et transparence, unifier et fédérer l'écosystème.
Peu de chances que cette initiative puisse réellement influencer Oracle. Est-ce que l'éditeur veut réellement relancer MySQL et redonner une véritable dimension open source à la base de données ? Les annonces à la FOSDEM vont dans le bon sens mais le plus difficile reste à faire : concrétiser réellement ces annonces.

### 55. `FR` [10 pratiques de codes et humaines à intégrer](data/articles/19423dbc363c812677c0265affaca120.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Parfois, il est bon de revenir aux fondamentaux et de se rappeler quelques concepts qui peuvent sembler simplistes, mais qui restent toujours utiles. 1 / On lit plus de code qu’on en écrit
Même si on essaie de faire simple et clair, quand on rouvre un code six mois plus tard, on se demande souvent : qu’est-ce que j’ai voulu faire ? Bref : * des noms de variables simples, mais répondant à une logique claire
* la lisibilité du code doit primer sur les performances pures Et gardez toujours en tête : serai-je capable de relire et comprendre ce code dans six mois ? 2 / Faire simple, c’est difficile Il est plus facile de faire compliqué que de faire simple. On ajoute des couches, des dépendances, des patterns dans tous les sens. Faire simple permet : * moins de risques d’erreurs
* un code plus facile à tester
* une meilleure maintenance sur le long terme 3 / Vous n’avez pas besoin de tout savoir, mais vous devez apprendre Un développeur ne sait pas tout. Mais il apprend. Il faut lire la documentation, décomposer les problèmes, expérimenter et apprendre en continu pour progresser. 4 / Le debug est une compétence Certains développeurs savent mieux debugger que d’autres. C’est un fait. Ils trouvent plus facilement les bugs, restent calmes et savent observer et comprendre le problème. Pour corriger un bug, il faut : * savoir le reproduire clairement
* modifier un élément à la fois
* lire et comprendre les logs, warnings et messages d’erreur 5 / Les frameworks ne changent pas les fondamentaux Maîtriser les fondamentaux est toujours un avantage. Cette maîtrise vous aidera à migrer plus sereinement d’une version à une autre, ou même à changer de technologie. Les frameworks évoluent. Les fondamentaux restent. 6 / Les problèmes de performances sont souvent des problèmes de conception Avant d’optimiser avec du caching, du tuning ou des micro-optimisations, regardez d’abord l’architecture et la conception du projet : * vos requêtes fonctionnent-elles correctement et sont-elles bien écrites ?
* le modèle de données est-il adapté ?
* pouvez-vous réduire les appels réseau inutiles ?
* certaines boucles peuvent-elles être optimisées ? Les gains les plus importants viennent souvent de la conception, pas des optimisations mineures. 7 / Écrire des tests Les tests permettent : * de refactoriser en toute sécurité
* de détecter plus rapidement les problèmes
* d’améliorer la qualité globale du code Les tests ne ralentissent pas le développement. Ils le sécurisent. 8 / La communication fait partie de notre métier Cela inclut notamment les et la documentation du code. Un code documenté est plus facile à comprendre, maintenir et faire évoluer dans le temps. Le code explique le « ». Les expliquent le « pourquoi ». 9 / Le burn-out est aussi un problème technique La pression des délais, les longues heures de développement ou le manque de vision peuvent conduire à un code de mauvaise qualité, difficile à maintenir. Un code de qualité nécessite : * du temps
* de la réflexion
* et des conditions de travail saines La qualité technique est aussi une question d’organisation. 10 / La progression n’est pas linéaire Développer, c’est traverser des périodes très productives, où tout fonctionne rapidement, et d’autres beaucoup plus difficiles : bugs incompréhensibles, code instable, spécifications floues. C’est normal. Dans ces moments-là, il faut revenir aux fondamentaux, reprendre le problème étape par étape et garder son calme. La progression se fait sur le long terme.

### 59. `FR` [Python Environnements Extension : pour unifier les environnements Python sur Visual Studio Code](data/articles/0391e1744355c8f298076bf20a13eb17.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Pour simplifier et unifier l'environnement de développement Python sur Visual Studio Code, on dispose de la nouvelle extension Python Environnements. Il doit unifier le modèle de développement, gérer les environnements et les workflows, gérer les interpréteurs et les packages. Jusqu'é présent, l'expérience Python était fragmenté à travers les différents outils (venv, conda, pyenv, etc.). Après plus d'un an d'ajustements et de développement, l'extension est disponible. A terme, tous les flux Python migreront vers l'extension Environnements. Il est possible d'activer dès maintenant : python.useEnvsExtension. L'extension fonctionne en parallèle de l'extension Python et aucune configuration particulière n'est requise : vous ouvrez un fichier Python et l'environnement utilisé est automatiquement détecté. Les environnements supportés sont : venv
conda
pyenv
poetry
pipenv
System Python installs La découverte est assurée par PET (Python Environment Tool), un outil de scan codé en Rust. Si vous utilisez uv, l'extension va automatiquement créer un environnement venv et installer les paquets nécessaires. Pour le moment, il n'est pas possible de créer rapidement des projets sur tous les environnements, seuls venv et conda sont supportés. Sans doute que les autres le seront dans les prochaines versions. Mauvaise nouvelle : l'extension fonctionne UNIQUEMENT sur Windows x64 et Windows ARM et l'édition Web ! Il faut Python soit installé.
Pour le moment, les retours sont plutôt mauvais : extension difficile à utiliser, perte de temps pour créer les environnements depuis Pylance, etc. Et les mises à jour se succèdent. Heureusement que l'extension est officiellement en preview.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Comcast, Classiq et AMD mènent des tests pour améliorer le trafic Internet en utilisant des algorithmes quantiques pour renforcer la résistance du routage réseau. "L’essai conjoint s’est concentré sur un défi clé de la conception des réseaux : identifier des chemins de secours indépendants pour les nœuds du réseau lors des opérations de maintenance ou de modifications. L’objectif était de garantir que, si un site est mis hors ligne et que soudainement, un deuxième tombe en panne, le trafic puisse être redirigé sans interruption ni dégradation du service pour les clients. Pour y parvenir, les opérateurs doivent identifier des chemins de secours distincts, rapides et capables de résister à des pannes simultanées, tout en minimisant la latence. Cette tâche devient de plus en plus complexe à mesure que le réseau s’étend." explique l'annonce. Le schéma présente le design et l'implémentation du flux et de l'algo quantique sur la plateforme Classiq. L’expérimentation a combiné des techniques de calcul quantique et des méthodes classiques haute performance afin d’évaluer la capacité des algorithmes quantiques à identifier, en temps réel, des chemins de secours dans des scénarios de gestion des changements. Elle a été menée à la fois sur du matériel quantique et dans des environnements de simulation accélérés utilisant des GPU AMD Instinct, afin d’atteindre une capacité de calcul (à l’échelle des qubits) encore hors de portée du matériel quantique seul.
« L’avenir du calcul repose sur la convergence entre le classique et le quantique », explique Madhu Rangarajan, vice-président corporate en charge des produits Compute et Enterprise AI chez AMD. « En tant qu’acteur du calcul haute performance, nous cherchons à comprendre nos technologies peuvent accompagner l’émergence du quantique. Cette collaboration montre un cas concret où la simulation accélérée et l’exécution quantique sont combinées pour répondre à un enjeu opérationnel réel dans les réseaux. »

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
concilier agents IA et sites web et la manière dont les pages web pourraient interagir, travailler avec les agents ? WebMCP veut fournir une méthode standard pour définir les actions des agents sur un site web, sur une page web sans pénaliser au bon fonctionnement du site web. "Vous indiquez aux agents et où interagir avec votre site, qu'il s'agisse de réserver un vol, de soumettre une demande d'assistance ou de naviguer dans des données complexes. Ce canal de communication direct élimine toute ambiguïté et permet des flux de travail plus rapides et plus efficaces pour les agents." expliquer Google. WebMCP preview repose sur 2 API :
- API déclarative : Permet d’effectuer des actions standard définies directement dans les formulaires HTML. - API impérative : Permet d’effectuer des interactions plus complexes et dynamiques nécessitant l’exécution de JavaScript. C'est une interface proposé en preview par Google et accessible dans Chrome. Ces API forment un "pont" rendant votre site web "agent ready" et permet de créer des flux agentiques que se veulent plus fiables qu'en passant par du DOM. Ces API sont JavaScript. Pour le moment, la spécification est en cours de rédaction. Elle ne dépend pas de W3C et n'est pas un standard du consortium.

### 64. `FR` [.Net 11 Preview 1 : nouvelles librairies, peu de changements dans C#](data/articles/37ed40d4ebc110a4614a0e84996bc9bd.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
.Net 10 a été distribuée en novembre 2025. La version 11 est désormais disponible en preview 1. Comme à chaque fois, de nombreuses évolutions sont attendues. L'ensemble des frameworks et des langages sont concernées : C#, F#, ASP.Net Core, Blazor, MAUI, le compilateur Jit, le support de CoreCLR dans WebAssembly, meilleure compression / décompression avec Zstandard. Sur la partie librairie, retenons déjà les évolutions suivantes :
- Zstandard est natif à .Net pour la compression. La librairie promet une nette amélioration des performances :
// Compress data using ZstandardStream
using var compressStream = new ZstandardStream(outputStream, CompressionMode.Compress);
await inputStream.CopyToAsync(compressStream); // Decompress data
using var decompressStream = new ZstandardStream(inputStream, CompressionMode.Decompress);
await decompressStream.CopyToAsync(outputStream);
- BFloat16 intègre par défaut toutes les interfaces standards pour le numérique
- amélioration de TimeZone
Note de version sur les librairies : https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/11.0/preview/preview1/libraries.md
Sur la partie runtime, il faut s'attendre à de bonnes nouvelles :
- Runtime async : une nouvelle fonction majeure du runtime et méthodes asynchrones pour améliorer les performances. CoreCLR supporte RuntimeAsync par défaut, idem pour Native AOT
- CoreCLR est supporté dans WebAssembly. Il n'est pas encore disponible en preview 1.
- diverses améliorations de performances sur le JIT - meilleur support de RISC-V
Sur C#, pour le moment, peu de nouveautés annoncées. Deux nouvelles fonctions sont attendues : arguments pour les expresssions Collection et support Extended layout. .Net 11 n'introduira aucune nouvelle fonctionnalité pour Visual Basic. Sur ASP.Net Core et Blazor, les développeurs vont avoir beaucoup de nouveautés : EnvironmentBoundary, nouveau composant Label dans les formulaires Blazor, nouveau composant DisplayName, navigation relative Uri, support "propre" des éléments MathML dans un rendu interactif. Tous les détails dans la note de version : https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/11.0/preview/preview1/aspnetcore.md
La génération de source XAML est par défaut pour les applications .Net MAUI, cela doit permettre un build plus rapide et un debug plus performant. Sur Android, CoreCLR devient le runtime par défaut. Sur Container Images et Winfows Forms, pas de nouveautés annoncées.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
En février, il y a la corvée commerciale de la Saint-Valentin et les réjouissances intellectuelles consécutives à la sortie d’une nouvelle version de la suite bureautique LibreOffice. C’est, bien évidemment, sur LibreOffice 26.2 que l’on va se pencher. Au menu, du très visible, comme les boites de dialogues, du très attendu comme la prise en compte du Markdown ou du moins visible comme le travail sur l’accessibilité.
Il va de soi que les notes de version sont plus exhaustives et qu’il ne s’agit ici que d’une sélection. lien nᵒ 1 : Notes de version Sommaire
L’accessibilité
Support du Markdown
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Writer
Calc
En vrac
Pour finir
Avant de commencer : toutes les captures d’écran ont été faites, volontairement, sur une interface très personnalisée.
L’accessibilité
L’accessibilité de la suite bureautique est un important chantier pour lequel une personne a été recrutée en 2023 (en). Cette version-ci a fait l’objet d’améliorations sensibles. Parallèlement, Sophie Gautier, coordinatrice de The Document Foundation1 (Foundation coordinator) est en train de monter un groupe de travail qui a pour objectif la publication d’un rapport de conformité en matière d’accessibilité pour répondre à la norme européenne EN 301 549 (en) d’accessiblité numérique. La langue de travail de ce groupe est l’anglais.
Concernant les améliorations de cette version :
la boite de dialogue « Vérifier les mises à jour », Aide &gt; Vérifier les mises à jour… est devenue accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
les fonctions d’accessibilité des aperçus des bordures, onglet « Bordures » des boites de dialogue, ont été revues afin qu’elles ne perturbent plus les dispositifs d’assistance ;
sur Linux : la boite de dialogue Outils&gt; Orthographe est annoncée correctement par le lecteur d’écran ;
quand on supprimait la sélection accessible, le curseur se déplaçait automatiquement au début du texte, ce comportement perturbant est supprimé ;
dans Writer, les fautes d’orthographe ne sont plus signalées par les dispositifs d’assistance si la vérification orthographique n’est pas activée ;
l’accessibilité au clavier de la boite de dialogue des extensions : Outils &gt; Extensions est accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
et enfin, il est possible de naviguer entre les onglets verticaux avec des raccourcis clavier.
Support du Markdown
Le Markdown est devenu le format de balisage léger standard « de fait ». Et c’est celui supporté par LinuxFR. Son support a été introduit dans cette version, c’est un des formats d’enregistrement qui s’est ajouté à la série des autres formats de la suite, pas un format d’export. Pour l’utiliser pour vos sites, passant pour LinuxFR, vous devrez :
soit ouvrir le fichier .md dans un éditeur de texte, n’importe lequel, même Mousepad fait l’affaire par exemple, et copier-coller ensuite le tout à partir de l’éditeur de texte là où vous le voulez ;
soit, si cela est possible, importer le fichier .md dans ce qui vous sert pour gérer le site comme le fait par exemple l’extension ODT2SPIP pour le système de gestion de contenu SPIP qui permet de créer une nouvelle page dans SPIP avec un fichier.ODT. ça marche avec LinuxFR ? Plutôt bien. Les styles de caractère Accentuation (ici en italiques) et Accentuation forte (ici gras) sont bien reconnu ainsi que Texte source pour « télétype », les indications in-texte encadrées de l’accent grave U+0060. Les styles de paragraphes :
Bloc de citation (paragraphes de citation précédés d’une ligne blanche et du signe « &gt; » dans la saisie de contenu sur LinuxFR) ;
Contenu de tableau ;
Corps de texte ;
Liste, par contre la numérotation des listes ordonnée ne semble pas bien fonctionner, il faut saisir les numéros à la main ;
Texte préformaté pour écrire des blocs de code ;
Titre 1, Titre 2, Titre 3 et Titre de tableau.
Les tableaux sont bien repris ainsi que les liens insérés via l’insertion d’hyperliens.
Ce qui ne semble pas fonctionner du tout : ce sont les notes, elles disparaissent corps et biens. C’est peut-être dû au passage dans l’éditeur de texte qui transforme un peu le document. Et, évidemment, il faut rajouter les images avec la syntaxe LinuxFR.
La version de Mardown de LibreOffice est CommonMark (en) et la bibliothèque utilisée est MD4C avec quelques extensions prises en charge par cette bibliothèque (cf ce rapport de bug (en) et ses réponses), pour en savoir plus, voir cette note (en) du blog de The Document Foundation.
Petite remarque, si vous utilisez un LibreOffice 25.8, vous avez peut-être pu constater qu’il était question d’enregistrement au format .md, cette information a été ajoutée trop précocement car la version 25.8 ne gère pas le Markdown.
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Les boites de dialogue, notamment de styles et de formats, ont beaucoup changé. Longtemps elles se sont affichées avec une présentation par onglets en haut et le contenu dessous.
Puis il y a une période de transition en 2025 qui a fait grincer une collection complète de dents où on avait, selon l’endroit où on était, soit des onglets soit une navigation par menu latéral. Cette dernière avait un gros défaut : par exemple pour la configuration des styles dans Writer il fallait descendre tout en bas pour accéder aux options qui étaient cachées. Et il n’y avait pas de barre de défilement pour aller plus vite.
LibreOffice 26.2 voit ces défauts corrigés : les boites de dialogue sont harmonisées dans toute la suite et leur menu latéral, toujours sans barre de défilement qui s’avère finalement inutile, montre clairement tous les types de paramètres auxquels on peut accéder. Et, comme on peut le voir, LibreOffice a intégré une meilleure prise en charge des systèmes d’écritures asiatiques et complexes en affichant deux colonnes, une pour les polices occidentales, ou pour les polices asiatiques ou complexes. Une personne a également été recrutée en 2023 (en) pour travailler sur le support des systèmes d’écriture de droite à gauche (RTL) et complexes (CTL). Si toutefois, vous préférez revenir à l’affichage avec les onglets, il suffit d’aller dans le menu Outils &gt; Options &gt; Apparenceau niveau de « Boites de dialogue » et cocher l’option Horizontal en haut. Il faut savoir que les onglets en haut ne s’affichent que sur une seule ligne et qu’il faudra donc naviguer avec les flèches quand il y a de nombreuses options. Writer
Il y a un certain nombre d’amélioration autour de la compatibilité avec le format DOCX : séparation de tableaux flottants en plusieurs tableaux, suppression de la numérotation des notes de bas de page à l’ouverture d’un fichier DOCX, etc.
On relèvera deux nouvelles options d’alignement des paragraphes : « Début » et « Fin ». Si vous utilisez l’alphabet latin, vous ne verrez aucune différence avec les deux options « Forcer à gauche/en haut » et « Forcer à droite/en bas ». Elles ont été développées pour réutiliser plus facilement les styles entre les divers systèmes d’écriture. Pour continuer sur la lancée du travail pour la prise en compte des systèmes d’écriture dont le fonctionnement est différent de celui de l’alphabet latin, il est possible de changer la direction du texte : de gauche à droite ou de droite à gauche en cours de travail. Cela peut se paramétrer dans les styles. Calc
Un gros travail sur les performances a été fait : vitesse de défilement, rapidité des classeurs avec de nombreuses formes et du rejet des modifications. On voit apparaître de nouvelles options de tri (Données &gt;Trier) qui dépendent de la « locale » (langue définie dans les Options de LibreOffice). On peut ainsi déterminer quel caractère est utilisé comme séparateur de décimal pour le tri naturel. On peut relever aussi une avancée ergonomique qui va plaire à toutes celles et ceux qui utilisent les matrices, on peut maintenant modifier les formules matricielles avec la combinaison de touches : F2 + ↑ Maj + Ctrl + Entrée, il n’est plus nécessaire de modifier la formule elle-même.
Et aussi : si vous utilisez (pourquoi diable ?) le format d’enregistrement XLSX, c’est le format EXCEL2010+ qui est le format par défaut, il change de nom pour devenir « Classeur Excel 2010-365 ».2
En vrac
Base est devenu complètement multi-utilisateur, TDF a, d’ailleurs, recruté une personne pour travailler sur l’application.
Concernant les diagrammes (ou chart) : dans le Volet latéral, quand le graphique est en mode modification et que l’on va, au niveau de « Couleurs », sur la palette, on a une prévisualisation en direct dans le diagramme ce qui permet de tester le choix de couleurs plus facilement.
Les polices embarquées dont la licence ne permettait pas l’édition étaient jusqu’à présent ignorées et remplacées à l’affichage, ni vu, ni connu par une fonte de substitution. Ce défaut a été corrigé.
L’export PDF gère les liens avec les documents externes : Fichier &gt; Exporter au format PDF &gt; Liens. Les dictionnaires hongrois, mongol et portugais du Portugal ont été mis à jour ainsi que les règles de césure de la langue hongroise.
JSON, pour JavaScript Object Notation, est un format standard utilisé pour représenter des données structurées. Il est utilisé notamment pour échanger les informations entre un navigateur et un serveur. C’est, par exemple, le format de sauvegarde des marques-pages de Firefox ou de certains fichiers d’archives de Mastodon. Les documents XML et JSON génériques avec des plages pouvant être liées sont maintenant automatiquement mappés à des feuilles dans Calc. Une plage pouvant être liée est une section d’un document contenant des enregistrements tabulaires. Lorsqu’un document contient plusieurs plages pouvant être liées, chaque plage est mappée à une seule feuille3.
Et si vous avez envie de vous amuser avec les fonctions expérimentales (à activer dansOutils &gt; Options &gt; LibreOffice &gt; Avancé), vous pouvez jouer avec la nouvelle de boite de dialogue « Gestion des macros ».
Pour finir
Cette dépêche a, bien, évidemment, été rédigée avec LibreOffice et, cette fois-ci dans un fichier enregistré en Markdown. Les seules balises que j’ai dû entrer à la main sont celles des images. Kate a l’air de modifier le fichier et, quand je réouvre le .md dans LibreOffice, il y a des styles qui ont sauté mais la mise en forme reste visuellement la même. Kate rajoute aussi des barres obliques devant les « &gt; », aux crochets [ ] et même à certains hyperliens (images). Il y a peut-être des éditeurs de texte plus adaptés ou des réglages à faire.
J’ai rédigé cette dépêche en même temps qu’un article sur LibreOffice 26.2 pour mon site. Si l’article n’est pas vraiment dupliqué, il n’est pas étonnant d’y trouver des morceaux ici. Que tout cela ne nous empêche d’adresser tous nos remerciements à celles et ceux qui font de LibreOffice une suite bureautique si agréable à utiliser et si performante.
Post-scriptum : si vous voulez savoir modifier les couleurs de l’interface comme sur les captures d’écran, ça peut s’envisager, demandez gentiment, avec un peu de chance.
The Document Foundation ou TDF est la fondation de droit allemand qui pilote le projet LibreOffice. Il y a deux formats OOXML différents et donc deux formats XLSX différents, la version 2007 et la version actuelle depuis 2010. S’il vous est vraiment nécessaire d’enregistrer au format XLSX, il faut utiliser la version de 2010. Notes de version.

### 4. `EN` [Show HN: OpenGem – A Load-Balanced Gemini API Proxy (No API Key Required)](data/articles/21ddb424e1f4b12704be456c915e68a6.html)
**Source:** Hacker News Show | **Keyword:** `Tech`
Hi HN! I built OpenGem, an open-source, load-balanced proxy for the Gemini API that requires absolutely no paid API keys.
GitHub: https://github.com/arifozgun/OpenGem
The Context:
Like many developers, I was constantly hitting "429 Quota Exceeded" errors while building AI agents and processing large payloads on free tiers. I wanted to build freely without calculating API costs for every test request.
How it works:
I reverse-engineered the official Gemini CLI authentication to get standard API access. However, a single free Google account quota depletes quickly. To solve this, I built a Smart Load Balancer at the core of OpenGem.
What it does:
- You connect multiple idle/free Google accounts to the dashboard via OAuth.
- OpenGem acts as a standard endpoint (`POST /v1beta/models/{model}`).
- It routes traffic to the least-used account. If an account hits a real 429 quota limit, OpenGem instantly detects it, puts that account on a 60-minute cooldown, and seamlessly retries with the next available account. It differentiates between simple RPM bursts and actual limits.
Tech specs:
- Fully compatible with official Google SDKs (`@google/genai`), LangChain, and standard SSE streaming (no broken [DONE] chunks).
- Supports native "tools" (Function Calling) for agentic workflows.
- Raised payload limit to 50MB for massive contexts.
- AES-256-GCM encryption for all sensitive configs and OAuth tokens at rest.
- Toggle between Firebase Firestore or a fully offline Local JSON database.
It’s strictly for educational purposes and personal research to bypass the friction of testing/prototyping. The entire project is MIT licensed.
I’m currently running it with my own side projects and it handles heavy agent tasks flawlessly. I would love any feedback on the load balancing logic, security implementations, or just general thoughts! URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47111607

### 5. `EN` [Show HN: SergioAI – Trello bot with Claude that reviews PRDs and opens draft PRs](data/articles/468e33c6af2feb1fb2a2bb60ca4dd02e.html)
**Source:** Hacker News Show | **Keyword:** `Tech`
I built an open-source bot that turns Trello cards into working code using Claude Code.
Drop a task card in a list → Sergio picks it up, explores your codebase, and posts an implementation plan as a . Add feedback, move the card back, and iterate. When you're happy, move it to the Development list → Sergio creates a worktree, writes the code, runs tests, and opens a draft PR on GitHub.
It's a tool that can be used by teams of devs and product managers to cover the knowledge gaps between non technical and technical planning.
All triggered by dragging cards. It's basically Claude Code running as an autonomous teammate on a $5/month VM, orchestrated through Trello. The two-user sandbox architecture keeps the AI isolated from secrets and credentials (similar to OpenClaw's approach to secure agentic coding).
The roadmap includes pluggable engine support (OpenCode, Codex) and MCP servers for reading Google Docs, Figma, and Notion directly from cards. URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47111063

### 6. `EN` [Show HN: RMirror Cloud – Open-Source OCR and Notion Sync for ReMarkable Tablets](data/articles/a47aa88cc03390a6c4da6ccb787ff126.html)
**Source:** Hacker News Show | **Keyword:** `Tech`
I built an open-source cloud service for reMarkable tablets that does three things:
Syncs notebooks from your reMarkable to the cloud via a macOS background agent
Runs AI-powered OCR on handwritten pages (Claude API, not Tesseract)
Pushes transcribed notes to Notion as searchable pages
Stack: FastAPI backend, Next.js dashboard, Python agent. Self-hostable.
The reMarkable's handwriting recognition (via Connect) is okay for typed-looking text but struggles with real handwriting. I wanted something better that also gave me web access to my notes and pushed them to Notion where I actually work.
GitHub: https://github.com/gottino/rmirror-cloud
Request beta access: https://rmirror.io/

### 7. `EN` [Show HN: CanaryAI v0.2.5 – Security monitoring on Claude Code actions](data/articles/370719cd438b3643058dadd14e704c74.html)
**Source:** Hacker News Show | **Keyword:** `Tech`
I've been using Claude Code a lot recently and wanted visibility into security-relevant executions — the kind of thing you may not necessarily catch while the agent is running.
CanaryAI is a macOS menu bar app that monitors Claude Code session logs and alerts on suspicious behaviour: reverse shells, credential file access, LaunchAgent/cron persistence, download-and-execute patterns, shell profile modification. It parses the JSON logs Claude Code writes locally — no interception, no proxying. Alert-only; it never blocks the agent.
All processing is local. Detection rules are YAML so can be expanded on.

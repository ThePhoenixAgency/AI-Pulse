**Source:** Towards Data Science | **Tags:** `AI` `Data Science` `Analytics`
In this article, we explore LOF through three simple steps: distances and neighbors, reachability distances, and the final LOF score. Using tiny datasets, we see how two anomalies can look obvious to us but completely different to different algorithms. This reveals the key idea of unsupervised learn

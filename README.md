Apple today released iOS 26.3, iPadOS 26.3, and macOS Tahoe 26.3, all of which largely focus on bug fixes and security improvements. Apple says that the updates address dozens of vulnerabilities, including one that is known to have been actively exploited.


That vulnerability in the dyld dynamic link editor could allow for the execution of arbitrary code, and Apple says the bug may have been exploited in an "extremely sophisticated attack" against targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.
An attacker with memory write capability may be able to execute arbitrary code.

Apple has publicly released macOS Tahoe 26.3 after weeks of beta testing, but while it will have performance and security updates, there are no user-facing new features.

Apple has just released iOS 26.3 to iPhones everywhere, and as expected, it’s a relatively small update. With iOS 26.4 already on the horizon, and rumored to introduce substantial changes, including a Gemini-powered Siri, this release is more about incremental improvements that set the stage for big upcoming changes.
That said, iOS 26.3 still introduces a few notable additions, especially when it comes to device switching, privacy, and new capabilities for users in the EU. Read on as we break down everything new in iOS 26.3.

Apple keeps its operating systems in lock step with its point updates, so even if it might be just bug fixes and minor feature tweaks, visionOS 26.3 is here.

The OS 26.3 release is mostly focused on bug fixes and features found in iOS, so Apple Vision Pro users are getting a light update. It should be the last point update before Apple's big Apple Intelligence upgrade lands in the OS 26.4 release.
The visionOS 26.3 update is here and it doesn't have any user-facing features.

Following the release of iOS 16.2 on Friday, December 12, the first beta release of iOS 26.3 was made available to developers a few days later, on December 15. We expect a final release to the public sometime in late January or early February. This is reportedly the last minor refresh before iOS 26.4 brings the revamped Siri upgrade we’ve waited over a year to get.

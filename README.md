**Source:** Towards Data Science | **Tags:** `AI` `Data Science` `Analytics`
Instead of starting with margins and geometry, this article builds the Support Vector Machine step by step from familiar models. By changing the loss function and reusing regularization, SVM appears naturally as a linear classifier trained by optimization. This perspective unifies logistic regressio

Softmax Regression is simply Logistic Regression extended to multiple classes.
By computing one linear score per class and normalizing them with Softmax, we obtain multiclass probabilities without changing the core logic.
The loss, the gradients, and the optimization remain the same.

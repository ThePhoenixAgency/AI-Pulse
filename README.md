Achievement badges are a funny thing. You know they’re just a simple little bit of visual flair, they don’t even do anything, and yet for some reason you just have to collect them. Gamification can be a great motivator, and the achievement badges for the activity tracking on the Apple Watch have inspired many users to get more exercise. 
If you want to maximize your badge count, you’re going to want to chase down as many activity achievements as you can. Most are available year-round, but there are also some time-limited special events to grab, too.

Based mostly on Services growth prospects, Bernstein analyst raised his Apple price target to $340 from $325, while maintaining an Outperform rating.

Analysts raise their price target for AAPL
Toni Sacconaghi mentioned that there's now better insight into Apple's long-term earnings potential. Apple has seen growth in services and ongoing capital returns, as highlighted in a recent research summary.
Bernstein's revised target reflects confidence in Apple's ability to generate steady cash flow even as hardware demand remains uneven in some regions.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
Another analyst has jumped on the bandwagon believing Apple won't be increasing the cost of the iPhone 18 Pro and Pro Max, with pricing expected to be the same despite intense memory pressures.


iPhone 17 Pro, which the iPhone 18 Pro should look like this fall
The tech industry's current memory problem of rising prices, caused in part by the increase in AI infrastructure, is creating a problem for manufacturers of consumer devices. However, Apple seems to be insulated from the industry's woes of memory costs for the moment, and it may not be a big problem for the 2026 iPhone releases.

For years it’s been generally accepted that Macs have been much safer than PCs when it comes to malware and virus attacks. So much so, that it’s commonplace for Apple users to have no cybersecurity protections running on their machines other than what’s already built-in to macOS. But, this vulnerability seems to have caught the attention of hackers, as malware attacks (especially those powered by new AI software) have begun to appear which target Macs and their users. So, how can you make sure you stay safe from the new threats?

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
Instead of a Home or a side-button, Apple is researching how best to implement under-screen fingerprint sensors, not just for mobile devices like iPhone Fold and iPad, but potentially also the Mac.


Under-display Touch ID could come to future iPhones — or Macs.
The expected iPhone Fold has been said to be too thin for Face ID, so it must use Touch ID. Despite some claims of it getting Touch ID sensor under the screen, most reports predict it will be part of the side button, as was introduced with the iPad Air 4 back in 2020.

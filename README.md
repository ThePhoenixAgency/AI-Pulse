### 1. `EN` [Railway secures $100 million to challenge AWS with AI-native cloud infrastructure](data/articles/e670024b9a32e878ab282337aaddf6f9.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Railway, a San Francisco-based cloud platform that has quietly amassed two million developers without spending a dollar on marketing, announced Thursday that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, as surging demand for artificial intelligence applications exposes the limitations of legacy cloud infrastructure.
TQ Ventures led the round, with participation from FPV Ventures, Redpoint, and Unusual Ventures. The investment values Railway as one of the most significant infrastructure startups to emerge during the AI boom, capitalizing on developer frustration with the complexity and cost of traditional platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.
"As AI models get better at writing code, more and more people are asking the age-old question: where, and how, do I run my applications?" said Jake Cooper, Railway's 28-year-old founder and chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. "The last generation of cloud primitives were slow and outdated, and now with AI moving everything faster, teams simply can't keep up."
The funding is a dramatic acceleration for a company that has charted an unconventional path through the cloud computing industry. Railway raised just $24 million in total before this round, including a $20 million Series A from Redpoint in 2022. The company now processes more than 10 million deployments monthly and handles over one trillion requests through its edge network — metrics that rival far larger and better-funded competitors.
Why three-minute deploy times have become unacceptable in the age of AI coding assistants
Railway's pitch rests on a simple observation: the tools developers use to deploy and manage software were designed for a slower era. A standard build-and-deploy cycle using Terraform, the industry-standard infrastructure tool, takes two to three minutes. That delay, once tolerable, has become a critical bottleneck as AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor can generate working code in seconds.
"When godly intelligence is on tap and can solve any problem in three seconds, those amalgamations of systems become bottlenecks," Cooper told VentureBeat. "What was really cool for humans to deploy in 10 seconds or less is now table stakes for agents."
The company claims its platform delivers deployments in under one second — fast enough to keep pace with AI-generated code. Customers report a tenfold increase in developer velocity and up to 65 percent cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.
These numbers come directly from enterprise clients, not internal benchmarks. Daniel Lobaton, chief technology officer at G2X, a platform serving 100,000 federal contractors, measured deployment speed improvements of seven times faster and an 87 percent cost reduction after migrating to Railway. His infrastructure bill dropped from $15,000 per month to approximately $1,000.
"The work that used to take me a week on our previous infrastructure, I can do in Railway in like a day," Lobaton said. "If I want to spin up a new service and test different architectures, it would take so long on our old setup. In Railway I can launch six services in two minutes."
Inside the controversial decision to abandon Google Cloud and build data centers from scratch
What distinguishes Railway from competitors like Render and Fly.io is the depth of its vertical integration. In 2024, the company made the unusual decision to abandon Google Cloud entirely and build its own data centers, a move that echoes the famous Alan Kay maxim: "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware."
"We wanted to design hardware in a way where we could build a differentiated experience," Cooper said. "Having full control over the network, compute, and storage layers lets us do really fast build and deploy loops, the kind that allows us to move at 'agentic speed' while staying 100 percent the smoothest ride in town."
The approach paid dividends during recent widespread outages that affected major cloud providers — Railway remained online throughout.
This soup-to-nuts control enables pricing that undercuts the hyperscalers by roughly 50 percent and newer cloud startups by three to four times. Railway charges by the second for actual compute usage: $0.00000386 per gigabyte-second of memory, $0.00000772 per vCPU-second, and $0.00000006 per gigabyte-second of storage. There are no charges for idle virtual machines — a stark contrast to the traditional cloud model where customers pay for provisioned capacity whether they use it or not.
"The conventional wisdom is that the big guys have economies of scale to offer better pricing," Cooper noted. "But when they're charging for VMs that usually sit idle in the cloud, and we've purpose-built everything to fit much more density on these machines, you have a big opportunity."
How 30 employees built a platform generating tens of millions in annual revenue
Railway has achieved its scale with a team of just 30 employees generating tens of millions in annual revenue — a ratio of revenue per employee that would be exceptional even for established software companies. The company grew revenue 3.5 times last year and continues to expand at 15 percent month-over-month.
Cooper emphasized that the fundraise was strategic rather than necessary. "We're default alive; there's no reason for us to raise money," he said. "We raised because we see a massive opportunity to accelerate, not because we needed to survive."
The company hired its first salesperson only last year and employs just two solutions engineers. Nearly all of Railway's two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.
"We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come," Cooper recalled. "And to some degree, they came."
From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway's unlikely corporate expansion
Despite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.
Notable customers include Bilt, the loyalty program company; Intuit's GoCo subsidiary; TripAdvisor's Cruise Critic; and MGM Resorts. Kernel, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.
"At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS," said Rafael Garcia, Kernel's chief technology officer. "Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012."
For enterprise customers, Railway offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer's existing cloud environment through a "bring your own cloud" configuration.
Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).
The startup's bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivals
Railway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.
Cooper argues that Railway's competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.
"The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven't gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money," he observed. "They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don't really need to?"
Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. "We're not just containers; we've got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing," Cooper said. "And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster."
The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.
Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists today
Railway's fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.
"The amount of software that's going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we're talking a thousand times more software," Cooper predicted. "All of that has to run somewhere."
The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls "loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically." Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.
"The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes," Cooper said. "You don't have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity."
What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experience
Railway plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company's five-year history.
"One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business," Cooper explained. "We've built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what's been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage."
The company's investor roster reads like a who's who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Guillermo Rauch, chief executive of Vercel; Spencer Kimball, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; Olivier Pomel, chief executive of Datadog; and Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear.
The timing of Railway's expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper's telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.
Whether Railway can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at Wolfram Alpha, Bloomberg, and Uber before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.
"In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period," he said. "Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That's the prize worth playing for, and there's no bigger one on offer."
For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.

### 2. `EN` [Claude Code costs up to $200 a month. Goose does the same thing for free.](data/articles/1bd5d5f60cc30b30eee498627c185f8f.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
The artificial intelligence coding revolution comes with a catch: it's expensive.
Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-based AI agent that can write, debug, and deploy code autonomously, has captured the imagination of software developers worldwide. But its pricing — ranging from $20 to $200 per month depending on usage — has sparked a growing rebellion among the very programmers it aims to serve.
Now, a free alternative is gaining traction. Goose, an open-source AI agent developed by Block (the financial technology company formerly known as Square), offers nearly identical functionality to Claude Code but runs entirely on a user's local machine. No subscription fees. No cloud dependency. No rate limits that reset every five hours.
"Your data stays with you, period," said Parth Sareen, a software engineer who demonstrated the tool during a recent livestream. The captures the core appeal: Goose gives developers complete control over their AI-powered workflow, including the ability to work offline — even on an airplane.
The project has exploded in popularity. Goose now boasts more than 26,100 stars on GitHub, the code-sharing platform, with 362 contributors and 102 releases since its launch. The latest version, 1.20.1, shipped on January 19, 2026, reflecting a development pace that rivals commercial products.
For developers frustrated by Claude Code's pricing structure and usage caps, Goose represents something increasingly rare in the AI industry: a genuinely free, no-strings-attached option for serious work. Anthropic's new rate limits spark a developer revolt
To understand why Goose matters, you need to understand the Claude Code pricing controversy.
Anthropic, the San Francisco artificial intelligence company founded by former OpenAI executives, offers Claude Code as part of its subscription tiers. The free plan provides no access whatsoever. The Pro plan, at $17 per month with annual billing (or $20 monthly), limits users to just 10 to 40 prompts every five hours — a constraint that serious developers exhaust within minutes of intensive work.
The Max plans, at $100 and $200 per month, offer more headroom: 50 to 200 prompts and 200 to 800 prompts respectively, plus access to Anthropic's most powerful model, Claude 4.5 Opus. But even these premium tiers come with restrictions that have inflamed the developer community.
In late July, Anthropic announced new weekly rate limits. Under the system, Pro users receive 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 usage per week. Max users at the $200 tier get 240 to 480 hours of Sonnet 4, plus 24 to 40 hours of Opus 4. Nearly five months later, the frustration has not subsided.
The problem? Those "hours" are not actual hours. They represent token-based limits that vary wildly depending on codebase size, conversation length, and the complexity of the code being processed. Independent analysis suggests the actual per-session limits translate to roughly 44,000 tokens for Pro users and 220,000 tokens for the $200 Max plan.
"It's confusing and vague," one developer wrote in a widely shared analysis. "When they say '24-40 hours of Opus 4,' that doesn't really tell you anything useful about what you're actually getting."
The backlash on Reddit and developer forums has been fierce. Some users report hitting their daily limits within 30 minutes of intensive coding. Others have canceled their subscriptions entirely, calling the new restrictions "a joke" and "unusable for real work."
Anthropic has defended the changes, stating that the limits affect fewer than five percent of users and target people running Claude Code "continuously in the background, 24/7." But the company has not clarified whether that figure refers to five percent of Max subscribers or five percent of all users — a distinction that matters enormously.
How Block built a free AI coding agent that works offline
Goose takes a radically different approach to the same problem.
Built by Block, the payments company led by Jack Dorsey, Goose is what engineers call an "on-machine AI agent." Unlike Claude Code, which sends your queries to Anthropic's servers for processing, Goose can run entirely on your local computer using open-source language models that you download and control yourself.
The project's documentation describes it as going "beyond code suggestions" to "install, execute, edit, and test with any LLM." That last phrase — "any LLM" — is the key differentiator. Goose is model-agnostic by design.
You can connect Goose to Anthropic's Claude models if you have API access. You can use OpenAI's GPT-5 or Google's Gemini. You can route it through services like Groq or OpenRouter. Or — and this is where things get interesting — you can run it entirely locally using tools like Ollama, which let you download and execute open-source models on your own hardware.
The practical implications are significant. With a local setup, there are no subscription fees, no usage caps, no rate limits, and no concerns about your code being sent to external servers. Your conversations with the AI never leave your machine.
"I use Ollama all the time on planes — it's a lot of fun!" Sareen noted during a demonstration, highlighting how local models free developers from the constraints of internet connectivity.
What Goose can do that traditional code assistants can't
Goose operates as a command-line tool or desktop application that can autonomously perform complex development tasks. It can build entire projects from scratch, write and execute code, debug failures, orchestrate workflows across multiple files, and interact with external APIs — all without constant human oversight.
The architecture relies on what the AI industry calls "tool calling" or "function calling" — the ability for a language model to request specific actions from external systems. When you ask Goose to create a new file, run a test suite, or check the status of a GitHub pull request, it doesn't just generate text describing what should happen. It actually executes those operations.
This capability depends heavily on the underlying language model. Claude 4 models from Anthropic currently perform best at tool calling, according to the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, which ranks models on their ability to translate natural language requests into executable code and system commands.
But newer open-source models are catching up quickly. Goose's documentation highlights several options with strong tool-calling support: Meta's Llama series, Alibaba's Qwen models, Google's Gemma variants, and DeepSeek's reasoning-focused architectures.
The tool also integrates with the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, an emerging standard for connecting AI agents to external services. Through MCP, Goose can access databases, search engines, file systems, and third-party APIs — extending its capabilities far beyond what the base language model provides.
Setting Up Goose with a Local Model
For developers interested in a completely free, privacy-preserving setup, the process involves three main components: Goose itself, Ollama (a tool for running open-source models locally), and a compatible language model.
Step 1: Install Ollama
Ollama is an open-source project that dramatically simplifies the process of running large language models on personal hardware. It handles the complex work of downloading, optimizing, and serving models through a simple interface.
Download and install Ollama from ollama.com. Once installed, you can pull models with a single command. For coding tasks, Qwen 2.5 offers strong tool-calling support:
ollama run qwen2.5
The model downloads automatically and begins running on your machine.
Step 2: Install Goose
Goose is available as both a desktop application and a command-line interface. The desktop version provides a more visual experience, while the CLI appeals to developers who prefer working entirely in the terminal.
Installation instructions vary by operating system but generally involve downloading from Goose's GitHub releases page or using a package manager. Block provides pre-built binaries for macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux.
Step 3: Configure the Connection
In Goose Desktop, navigate to Settings, then Configure Provider, and select Ollama. Confirm that the API Host is set to http://localhost:11434 (Ollama's default port) and click Submit.
For the command-line version, run goose configure, select "Configure Providers," choose Ollama, and enter the model name when prompted.
That's it. Goose is now connected to a language model running entirely on your hardware, ready to execute complex coding tasks without any subscription fees or external dependencies.
The RAM, processing power, and trade-offs you should know about
The obvious question: what kind of computer do you need?
Running large language models locally requires substantially more computational resources than typical software. The key constraint is memory — specifically, RAM on most systems, or VRAM if using a dedicated graphics card for acceleration.
Block's documentation suggests that 32 gigabytes of RAM provides "a solid baseline for larger models and outputs." For Mac users, this means the computer's unified memory is the primary bottleneck. For Windows and Linux users with discrete NVIDIA graphics cards, GPU memory (VRAM) matters more for acceleration.
But you don't necessarily need expensive hardware to get started. Smaller models with fewer parameters run on much more modest systems. Qwen 2.5, for instance, comes in multiple sizes, and the smaller variants can operate effectively on machines with 16 gigabytes of RAM.
"You don't need to run the largest models to get excellent results," Sareen emphasized. The practical recommendation: start with a smaller model to test your workflow, then scale up as needed.
For context, Apple's entry-level MacBook Air with 8 gigabytes of RAM would struggle with most capable coding models. But a MacBook Pro with 32 gigabytes — increasingly common among professional developers — handles them comfortably.
Why keeping your code off the cloud matters more than ever
Goose with a local LLM is not a perfect substitute for Claude Code. The comparison involves real trade-offs that developers should understand.
Model Quality: Claude 4.5 Opus, Anthropic's flagship model, remains arguably the most capable AI for software engineering tasks. It excels at understanding complex codebases, following nuanced instructions, and producing high-quality code on the first attempt. Open-source models have improved dramatically, but a gap persists — particularly for the most challenging tasks.
One developer who switched to the $200 Claude Code plan described the difference bluntly: "When I say 'make this look modern,' Opus knows what I mean. Other models give me Bootstrap circa 2015."
Context Window: Claude Sonnet 4.5, accessible through the API, offers a massive one-million-token context window — enough to load entire large codebases without chunking or context management issues. Most local models are limited to 4,096 or 8,192 tokens by default, though many can be configured for longer contexts at the cost of increased memory usage and slower processing.
Speed: Cloud-based services like Claude Code run on dedicated server hardware optimized for AI inference. Local models, running on consumer laptops, typically process requests more slowly. The difference matters for iterative workflows where you're making rapid changes and waiting for AI feedback.
Tooling Maturity: Claude Code benefits from Anthropic's dedicated engineering resources. Features like prompt caching (which can reduce costs by up to 90 percent for repeated contexts) and structured outputs are polished and well-documented. Goose, while actively developed with 102 releases to date, relies on community contributions and may lack equivalent refinement in specific areas.
How Goose stacks up against Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and the paid AI coding market
Goose enters a crowded market of AI coding tools, but occupies a distinctive position.
Cursor, a popular AI-enhanced code editor, charges $20 per month for its Pro tier and $200 for Ultra—pricing that mirrors Claude Code's Max plans. Cursor provides approximately 4,500 Sonnet 4 requests per month at the Ultra level, a substantially different allocation model than Claude Code's hourly resets.
Cline, Roo Code, and similar open-source projects offer AI coding assistance but with varying levels of autonomy and tool integration. Many focus on code completion rather than the agentic task execution that defines Goose and Claude Code.
Amazon's CodeWhisperer, GitHub Copilot, and enterprise offerings from major cloud providers target large organizations with complex procurement processes and dedicated budgets. They are less relevant to individual developers and small teams seeking lightweight, flexible tools.
Goose's combination of genuine autonomy, model agnosticism, local operation, and zero cost creates a unique value proposition. The tool is not trying to compete with commercial offerings on polish or model quality. It's competing on freedom — both financial and architectural.
The $200-a-month era for AI coding tools may be ending

### 3. `EN` [Nous Research's NousCoder-14B is an open-source coding model landing right in the Claude Code moment](data/articles/b37d936464575171be4586234d600b41.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Nous Research, the open-source artificial intelligence startup backed by crypto venture firm Paradigm, released a new competitive programming model on Monday that it says matches or exceeds several larger proprietary systems — trained in just four days using 48 of Nvidia's latest B200 graphics processors.
The model, called NousCoder-14B, is another entry in a crowded field of AI coding assistants, but arrives at a particularly charged moment: Claude Code, the agentic programming tool from rival Anthropic, has dominated social media discussion since New Year's Day, with developers posting breathless testimonials about its capabilities. The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving — and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written.
type: embedded-entry-inline id: 74cSyrq6OUrp9SEQ5zOUSl
NousCoder-14B achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on LiveCodeBench v6, a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba's Qwen3-14B, according to Nous Research's technical report published alongside the release.
"I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour," wrote Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing — a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt.
The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic's Claude Code has captured imaginations with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap — and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability. How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicate
What distinguishes the NousCoder-14B release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the model weights but the complete reinforcement learning environment, benchmark suite, and training harness — built on the company's Atropos framework — enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to reproduce or extend the work.
"Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research," noted one observer on X, summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities.
The model was trained by Joe Li, a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li's technical report reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model's improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance.
Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B's improvemen t— from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 — mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days.
"Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience," Li wrote in the technical report.
But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners. Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problems
NousCoder-14B's training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.
The approach relies on what researchers call "verifiable rewards" — a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale.
Nous Research used Modal, a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints — 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively.
The training employed a technique called DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization), which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves "dynamic sampling" — discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning.
The researchers also adopted "iterative context extension," first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent.
Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification — as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters. The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progress
Buried in Li's technical report is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses "a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format."
In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data.
"The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude," Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. "This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data."
This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is "increasingly finite," as Li put it.
"It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures," he concluded.
The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn't — making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult.
Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. "Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction," he wrote. A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big Tech

**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup, Listen Labs, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million offers seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a billboard in San Francisco displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.
The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.
That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by Ribbit Capital with participation from Evantic and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Conviction, and Pear VC. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews. "When you obsess over customers, everything else follows," Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. "Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is."
Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it
Listen's AI researcher finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.
Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: "Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can't get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys." The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, "gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they're talking about. And the problem is you can't scale that."
The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.
What distinguishes Listen's approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. "In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options," Wahlforss said. "Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty."
The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraud
Listen finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called "one of the most shocking things that we've learned when we entered this industry"—rampant fraud.
"Essentially, there's a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players," he explained. "We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud."
The company built what it calls a "quality guard" that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: "People talk three times more. They're much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health."
Emeritus, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. "We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information," said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.
How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better products
The speed advantage has proven central to Listen's pitch. Traditional customer research at Microsoft could take four to six weeks to generate insights. "By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it," said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.
With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.
The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. "We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward," Patel said, "and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day." Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.
Simple Modern, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. "We went from 'Should we even have this product?' to 'How should we launch it?'" said Chris Hoyle, the company's Chief Marketing Officer.
Chubbies, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. "There's school, sports, dinner, and homework," explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. "I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules."
The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI "through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed." The redesigned product became "a blockbuster hit."
The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not less
Listen Labs is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly $140 billion annually, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption.
"There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing," Wahlforss said. "Why we're replacing them is that one, they're super costly. Two, they're kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with."
But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn't just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption.
"What I've noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don't need less of it. You want more of it," Wahlforss explained. "There's infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren't researchers before can now do that as part of their job."
Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toilet
Listen Labs traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. "We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day," Wahlforss recalled. "We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today."
The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss's co-founder "was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot." The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the International Olympiad in Informatics — the same competition that produced the founders of Cognition, the AI coding startup.
The Berghain billboard stunt generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.
"We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet," he said. "But now we fixed that situation."
The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.
Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building next
Wahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building "the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we've done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices."
Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. "Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?"
Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. "Obviously, as you said, there's kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop."
The company already handles sensitive data with care. "We don't train on any of the data," Wahlforss said. "We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that."
How AI could reshape the future of product development
Perhaps the most provocative implication of Listen's model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop.
"They're based in Australia, so they're coding during the day, and then in their night, they're releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate."
The vision extends Y Combinator's famous dictum — "write code, talk to users" — into an automated cycle. "Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you'll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously."
Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen's control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A 2024 MIT study found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos.
"I'm constantly have to emphasize like, let's make sure the quality is there and the details are right," he said.
But the company's growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft's Patel said Listen has "removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work." Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day.
"It's a total game changer," said Ali Romero, Sling Money's marketing manager.
Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he's building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website.
One of them: "Slow is fake."
It's an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution. But Listen Labs is betting that in the AI era, the companies that listen fastest will be the ones that win. The only question is whether customers will talk back.

### 5. `EN` [Salesforce rolls out new Slackbot AI agent as it battles Microsoft and Google in workplace AI](data/articles/db7ff708ed2fd3ffb22714bc4e846e1c.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Salesforce on Tuesday launched an entirely rebuilt version of Slackbot, the company's workplace assistant, transforming it from a simple notification tool into what executives describe as a fully powered AI agent capable of searching enterprise data, drafting documents, and taking action on behalf of employees.
The new Slackbot, now generally available to Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, is Salesforce's most aggressive move yet to position Slack at the center of the emerging "agentic AI" movement — where software agents work alongside humans to complete complex tasks. The launch comes as Salesforce attempts to convince investors that artificial intelligence will bolster its products rather than render them obsolete.
"Slackbot isn't just another copilot or AI assistant," said Parker Harris, Salesforce co-founder and Slack's chief technology officer, in an exclusive interview with Salesforce. "It's the front door to the agentic enterprise, powered by Salesforce."
From tricycle to Porsche: Salesforce rebuilt Slackbot from the ground up
Harris was blunt about what distinguishes the new Slackbot from its predecessor: "The old Slackbot was, you know, a little tricycle, and the new Slackbot is like, you know, a Porsche."
The original Slackbot, which has existed since Slack's early days, performed basic algorithmic tasks — reminding users to add colleagues to documents, suggesting channel archives, and delivering simple notifications. The new version runs on an entirely different architecture built around a large language model and sophisticated search capabilities that can access Salesforce records, Google Drive files, calendar data, and years of Slack conversations.
"It's two different things," Harris explained. "The old Slackbot was algorithmic and fairly simple. The new Slackbot is brand new — it's based around an LLM and a very robust search engine, and connections to third-party search engines, third-party enterprise data."
Salesforce chose to retain the Slackbot brand despite the fundamental technical overhaul. "People know what Slackbot is, and so we wanted to carry that forward," Harris said.
Why Anthropic's Claude powers the new Slackbot — and which AI models could come next
The new Slackbot runs on Claude, Anthropic's large language model, a choice driven partly by compliance requirements. Slack's commercial service operates under FedRAMP Moderate certification to serve U.S. federal government customers, and Harris said Anthropic was "the only provider that could give us a compliant LLM" when Slack began building the new system.
But that exclusivity won't last. "We are, this year, going to support additional providers," Harris said. "We have a great relationship with Google. Gemini is incredible — performance is great, cost is great. So we're going to use Gemini for some things." He added that OpenAI remains a possibility as well.
Harris echoed Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's view that large language models are becoming commoditized: "You've heard Marc talk about LLMs are commodities, that they're democratized. I call them CPUs."
On the sensitive question of training data, Harris was unequivocal: Salesforce does not train any models on customer data. "Models don't have any sort of security," he explained. "If we trained it on some confidential conversation that you and I have, I don't want Carolyn to know — if I train it into the LLM, there is no way for me to say you get to see the answer, but Carolyn doesn't."
Inside Salesforce's internal experiment: 80,000 employees tested Slackbot with striking results
Salesforce has been testing the new Slackbot internally for months, rolling it out to all 80,000 employees. According to Ryan Gavin, Slack's chief marketing officer, the results have been striking: "It's the fastest adopted product in Salesforce history."
Internal data shows that two-thirds of Salesforce employees have tried the new Slackbot, with 80% of those users continuing to use it regularly. Internal satisfaction rates reached 96% — the highest for any AI feature Slack has shipped. Employees report saving between two and 20 hours per week.
The adoption happened largely organically. "I think it was about five days, and a Canvas was developed by our employees called 'The Most Stealable Slackbot Prompts,'" Gavin said. "People just started adding to it organically. I think it's up to 250-plus prompts that are in this Canvas right now."
Kate Crotty, a principal UX researcher at Salesforce, found that 73% of internal adoption was driven by social sharing rather than top-down mandates. "Everybody is there to help each other learn and communicate hacks," she said.
How Slackbot transforms scattered enterprise data into executive-ready insights
During a product demonstration, Amy Bauer, Slack's product experience designer, showed how Slackbot can synthesize information across multiple sources. In one example, she asked Slackbot to analyze customer feedback from a pilot program, upload an image of a usage dashboard, and have Slackbot correlate the qualitative and quantitative data.
"This is where Slackbot really earns its keep for me," Bauer explained. "What it's doing is not just simply reading the image — it's actually looking at the image and comparing it to the insight it just generated for me."
Slackbot can then query Salesforce to find enterprise accounts with open deals that might be good candidates for early access, creating what Bauer called "a really great justification and plan to move forward." Finally, it can synthesize all that information into a Canvas — Slack's collaborative document format — and find calendar availability among stakeholders to schedule a review meeting.
"Up until this point, we have been working in a one-to-one capacity with Slackbot," Bauer said. "But one of the benefits that I can do now is take this insight and have it generate this into a Canvas, a shared workspace where I can iterate on it, refine it with Slackbot, or share it out with my team."
Rob Seaman, Slack's chief product officer, said the Canvas creation demonstrates where the product is heading: "This is making a tool call internally to Slack Canvas to actually write, effectively, a shared document. But it signals where we're going with Slackbot — we're eventually going to be adding in additional third-party tool calls."
MrBeast's company became a Slackbot guinea pig—and employees say they're saving 90 minutes a day
Among Salesforce's pilot customers is Beast Industries, the parent company of YouTube star MrBeast. Luis Madrigal, the company's chief information officer, joined the launch announcement to describe his experience.
"As somebody who has rolled out enterprise technologies for over two decades now, this was practically one of the easiest," Madrigal said. "The plumbing is there. Slack as an implementation, Enterprise Tools — being able to turn on the Slackbot and the Slack AI functionality was as simple as having my team go in, review, do a quick security review."
Madrigal said his security team signed off "rather quickly" — unusual for enterprise AI deployments — because Slackbot accesses only the information each individual user already has permission to view. "Given all the guardrails you guys have put into place for Slackbot to be unique and customized to only the information that each individual user has, only the conversations and the Slack rooms and Slack channels that they're part of—that made my security team sign off rather quickly."
One Beast Industries employee, Sinan, the head of Beast Games marketing, reported saving "at bare minimum, 90 minutes a day." Another employee, Spencer, a creative supervisor, described it as "an assistant who's paying attention when I'm not."
Other pilot customers include Slalom, reMarkable, Xero, Mercari, and Engine. Mollie Bodensteiner, SVP of Operations at Engine, called Slackbot "an absolute 'chaos tamer' for our team," estimating it saves her about 30 minutes daily "just by eliminating context switching."

### 6. `EN` [Anthropic launches Cowork, a Claude Desktop agent that works in your files — no coding required](data/articles/a102a18a5efc083299a9baaa1b4a8378.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Anthropic released Cowork on Monday, a new AI agent capability that extends the power of its wildly successful Claude Code tool to non-technical users — and according to company insiders, the team built the entire feature in approximately a week and a half, largely using Claude Code itself.
The launch marks a major inflection point in the race to deliver practical AI agents to mainstream users, positioning Anthropic to compete not just with OpenAI and Google in conversational AI, but with Microsoft's Copilot in the burgeoning market for AI-powered productivity tools.
"Cowork lets you complete non-technical tasks much like how developers use Claude Code," the company announced via its official Claude account on X. The feature arrives as a research preview available exclusively to Claude Max subscribers — Anthropic's power-user tier priced between $100 and $200 per month — through the macOS desktop application.
For the past year, the industry narrative has focused on large language models that can write poetry or debug code. With Cowork, Anthropic is betting that the real enterprise value lies in an AI that can open a folder, read a messy pile of receipts, and generate a structured expense report without human hand-holding. How developers using a coding tool for vacation research inspired Anthropic's latest product
The genesis of Cowork lies in Anthropic's recent success with the developer community. In late 2024, the company released Claude Code, a terminal-based tool that allowed software engineers to automate rote programming tasks. The tool was a hit, but Anthropic noticed a peculiar trend: users were forcing the coding tool to perform non-coding labor.
According to Boris Cherny, an engineer at Anthropic, the company observed users deploying the developer tool for an unexpectedly diverse array of tasks. "Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven," Cherny wrote on X. "These use cases are diverse and surprising — the reason is that the underlying Claude Agent is the best agent, and Opus 4.5 is the best model."
Recognizing this shadow usage, Anthropic effectively stripped the command-line complexity from their developer tool to create a consumer-friendly interface. In its blog post announcing the feature, Anthropic explained that developers "quickly began using it for almost everything else," which "prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude in the very same way."
Inside the folder-based architecture that lets Claude read, edit, and create files on your computer
Unlike a standard chat interface where a user pastes text for analysis, Cowork requires a different level of trust and access. Users designate a specific folder on their local machine that Claude can access. Within that sandbox, the AI agent can read existing files, modify them, or create entirely new ones.
Anthropic offers several illustrative examples: reorganizing a cluttered downloads folder by sorting and intelligently renaming each file, generating a spreadsheet of expenses from a collection of receipt screenshots, or drafting a report from scattered notes across multiple documents.
"In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder," the company explained on X. "Try it to create a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft from scattered notes." The architecture relies on what is known as an "agentic loop." When a user assigns a task, the AI does not merely generate a text response. Instead, it formulates a plan, executes steps in parallel, checks its own work, and asks for clarification if it hits a roadblock. Users can queue multiple tasks and let Claude process them simultaneously — a workflow Anthropic describes as feeling "much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker."
The system is built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK, meaning it shares the same underlying architecture as Claude Code. Anthropic notes that Cowork "can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks."
The recursive loop where AI builds AI: Claude Code reportedly wrote much of Claude Cowork
Perhaps the most remarkable detail surrounding Cowork's launch is the speed at which the tool was reportedly built — highlighting a recursive feedback loop where AI tools are being used to build better AI tools.
During a livestream hosted by Dan Shipper, Felix Rieseberg, an Anthropic employee, confirmed that the team built Cowork in approximately a week and a half.
Alex Volkov, who covers AI developments, expressed surprise at the timeline: "Holy shit Anthropic built 'Cowork' in the last... week and a half?!" This prompted immediate speculation about how much of Cowork was itself built by Claude Code. Simon Smith, EVP of Generative AI at Klick Health, put it bluntly on X: "Claude Code wrote all of Claude Cowork. Can we all agree that we're in at least somewhat of a recursive improvement loop here?"
The implication is profound: Anthropic's AI coding agent may have substantially contributed to building its own non-technical sibling product. If true, this is one of the most visible examples yet of AI systems being used to accelerate their own development and expansion — a strategy that could widen the gap between AI labs that successfully deploy their own agents internally and those that do not.
Connectors, browser automation, and skills extend Cowork's reach beyond the local file system
Cowork doesn't operate in isolation. The feature integrates with Anthropic's existing ecosystem of connectors — tools that link Claude to external information sources and services such as Asana, Notion, PayPal, and other supported partners. Users who have configured these connections in the standard Claude interface can leverage them within Cowork sessions.
Additionally, Cowork can pair with Claude in Chrome, Anthropic's browser extension, to execute tasks requiring web access. This combination allows the agent to navigate websites, click buttons, fill forms, and extract information from the internet — all while operating from the desktop application.
"Cowork includes a number of novel UX and safety features that we think make the product really special," Cherny explained, highlighting "a built-in VM [virtual machine] for isolation, out of the box support for browser automation, support for all your claude.ai data connectors, asking you for clarification when it's unsure."
Anthropic has also introduced an initial set of "skills" specifically designed for Cowork that enhance Claude's ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. These build on the Skills for Claude framework the company announced in October, which provides specialized instruction sets Claude can load for particular types of tasks.
Why Anthropic is warning users that its own AI agent could delete their files
The transition from a chatbot that suggests edits to an agent that makes edits introduces significant risk. An AI that can organize files can, theoretically, delete them.
In a notable display of transparency, Anthropic devoted considerable space in its announcement to warning users about Cowork's potential dangers — an unusual approach for a product launch.
The company explicitly acknowledges that Claude "can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it's instructed to." Because Claude might occasionally misinterpret instructions, Anthropic urges users to provide "very clear guidance" about sensitive operations.
More concerning is the risk of prompt injection attacks — a technique where malicious actors embed hidden instructions in content Claude might encounter online, potentially causing the agent to bypass safeguards or take harmful actions.
"We've built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections," Anthropic wrote, "but agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude's real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry."
The company characterized these risks as inherent to the current state of AI agent technology rather than unique to Cowork. "These risks aren't new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you're using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation," the announcement notes.
Anthropic's desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft Copilot
The launch of Cowork places Anthropic in direct competition with Microsoft, which has spent years attempting to integrate its Copilot AI into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.
However, Anthropic's approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application.
What distinguishes Anthropic's approach is its bottom-up evolution. Rather than designing an AI assistant and retrofitting agent capabilities, Anthropic built a powerful coding agent first — Claude Code — and is now abstracting its capabilities for broader audiences. This technical lineage may give Cowork more robust agentic behavior from the start.
Claude Code has generated significant enthusiasm among developers since its initial launch as a command-line tool in late 2024. The company expanded access with a web interface in October 2025, followed by a Slack integration in December. Cowork is the next logical step: bringing the same agentic architecture to users who may never touch a terminal.
Who can access Cowork now, and what's coming next for Windows and other platforms
For now, Cowork remains exclusive to Claude Max subscribers using the macOS desktop application. Users on other subscription tiers — Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise — can join a waitlist for future access.
Anthropic has signaled clear intentions to expand the feature's reach. The blog post explicitly mentions plans to add cross-device sync and bring Cowork to Windows as the company learns from the research preview.
Cherny set expectations appropriately, describing the product as "early and raw, similar to what Claude Code felt like when it first launched."
To access Cowork, Max subscribers can download or update the Claude macOS app and click on "Cowork" in the sidebar.
The real question facing enterprise AI adoption
For technical decision-makers, the implications of Cowork extend beyond any single product launch. The bottleneck for AI adoption is shifting — no longer is model intelligence the limiting factor, but rather workflow integration and user trust.
Anthropic's goal, as the company puts it, is to make working with Claude feel less like operating a tool and more like delegating to a colleague. Whether mainstream users are ready to hand over folder access to an AI that might misinterpret their instructions remains an open question.
But the speed of Cowork's development — a major feature built in ten days, possibly by the company's own AI — previews a future where the capabilities of these systems compound faster than organizations can evaluate them. The chatbot has learned to use a file manager. What it learns to use next is anyone's guess.

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles Intel and Hugging Face collaborated to demonstrate the real-world value of upgrading to Google’s latest C4 Virtual Machine (VM) running on Intel Xeon 6 processors (codenamed Granite Rapids (GNR)). We specifically wanted to benchmark improvements in the text generation performance of OpenAI GPT OSS Large Language Model(LLM). The results are in, and they are impressive, demonstrating a 1.7x improvement in Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) over the previous-generation Google C3 VM instances. The Google Cloud C4 VM instance further resulted in: 1.4x to 1.7x TPOT throughput/vCPU/dollar
Lower price per hour over C3 VM Introduction GPT OSS is a common name for an open-source Mixture of Experts (MoE) model released by OpenAI. An MoE model is a deep neural network architecture that uses specialized “expert” sub-networks and a “gating network” to decide which experts to use for a given input. MoE models allow you to scale your model capacity efficiently without linearly scaling compute costs. They also allow for specialization, where different “experts” learn different skills, allowing them to adapt to diverse data distributions.
Even with very large parameters, only a small subset of experts is activated per token, making CPU inference viable.

### 16. `EN` [The creator of Claude Code just revealed his workflow, and developers are losing their minds](data/articles/c2e433d6dc0060138f55b9de14c8a605.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
When the creator of the world's most advanced coding agent speaks, Silicon Valley doesn't just listen — it takes notes.
For the past week, the engineering community has been dissecting a thread on X from Boris Cherny, the creator and head of Claude Code at Anthropic. What began as a casual sharing of his personal terminal setup has spiraled into a viral manifesto on the future of software development, with industry insiders calling it a watershed moment for the startup. "If you're not reading the Claude Code best practices straight from its creator, you're behind as a programmer," wrote Jeff Tang, a prominent voice in the developer community. Kyle McNease, another industry observer, went further, declaring that with Cherny's "game-changing updates," Anthropic is "on fire," potentially facing "their ChatGPT moment."
The excitement stems from a paradox: Cherny's workflow is surprisingly simple, yet it allows a single human to operate with the output capacity of a small engineering department. As one user noted on X after implementing Cherny's setup, the experience "feels more like Starcraft" than traditional coding — a shift from typing syntax to commanding autonomous units.
Here is an analysis of the workflow that is reshaping how software gets built, straight from the architect himself. How running five AI agents at once turns coding into a real-time strategy game
The most striking revelation from Cherny's disclosure is that he does not code in a linear fashion. In the traditional "inner loop" of development, a programmer writes a function, tests it, and moves to the next. Cherny, however, acts as a fleet commander.
"I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal," Cherny wrote. "I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input."
By utilizing iTerm2 system notifications, Cherny effectively manages five simultaneous work streams. While one agent runs a test suite, another refactors a legacy module, and a third drafts documentation. He also runs "5-10 Claudes on claude.ai" in his browser, using a "teleport" command to hand off sessions between the web and his local machine.
This validates the "do more with less" strategy articulated by Anthropic President Daniela Amodei earlier this week. While competitors like OpenAI pursue trillion-dollar infrastructure build-outs, Anthropic is proving that superior orchestration of existing models can yield exponential productivity gains.
The counterintuitive case for choosing the slowest, smartest model
In a surprising move for an industry obsessed with latency, Cherny revealed that he exclusively uses Anthropic's heaviest, slowest model: Opus 4.5.
"I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything," Cherny explained. "It's the best coding model I've ever used, and even though it's bigger &amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it's better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end."
For enterprise technology leaders, this is a critical insight. The bottleneck in modern AI development isn't the generation speed of the token; it is the human time spent correcting the AI's mistakes. Cherny's workflow suggests that paying the "compute tax" for a smarter model upfront eliminates the "correction tax" later.
One shared file turns every AI mistake into a permanent lesson
Cherny also detailed how his team solves the problem of AI amnesia. Standard large language models do not "remember" a company's specific coding style or architectural decisions from one session to the next.
To address this, Cherny's team maintains a single file named CLAUDE.md in their git repository. "Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time," he wrote.

Back to Articles With the growing capability of large language models (LLMs), a new class of models has emerged: Vision Language Models (VLMs). These models can analyze images and videos to describe scenes, create captions, and answer questions about visual content.
While running AI models on your own device can be difficult as these models are often computationally demanding, it also offers significant benefits: including improved privacy since your data stays on your machine, and enhanced speed and reliability because you're not dependent on an internet connection or external servers. This is where tools like Optimum Intel and OpenVINO come in, along with a small, efficient model like SmolVLM. In this blog post, we'll walk you through three easy steps to get a VLM running locally, with no expensive hardware or GPUs required (though you can run all the code samples from this blog post on Intel GPUs). Deploy your model with Optimum Small models like SmolVLM are built for low-resource consumption, but they can be further optimized. In this blog post we will see how to optimize your model, to lower memory usage and speedup inference, making it more efficient for deployment on devices with limited resources.

Back to Articles It has become increasingly challenging to assess whether a model’s
reported improvements reflect genuine advances or variations in
evaluation conditions, dataset composition, or training data that
mirrors benchmark tasks. The NVIDIA Nemotron approach to openness
addresses this by publishing transparent and reproducible evaluation
recipes that make results independently verifiable.
NVIDIA released Nemotron 3 Nano 30B

with an explicitly open evaluation approach to make that distinction
clear. Alongside the model card, we are publishing the complete
evaluation recipe used to generate the results, built with the
NVIDIA NeMo
Evaluator library, so
anyone can rerun the evaluation pipeline, inspect the artifacts, and
analyze the outcomes independently.
We believe that open innovation is the foundation of AI progress. This
level of transparency matters because most model evaluations omit
critical details. Configs, prompts, harness versions, runtime settings,
and logs are often missing or underspecified, and even small differences
in these parameters can materially change results. Without a complete

Realistic voice generation technology has gotten uncannily good in the past few years. In some situations, it’s possible to generate a synthetic voice that sounds almost exactly like the voice of a real person. And today, what once felt like science fiction is reality: Voice cloning. With just a few seconds of recorded speech, anyone’s voice can be made to say almost anything. Voice generation, and in particular the subtask of voice cloning, has notable risks and benefits. The risks of “deepfakes”, such as the cloned voice of former President Biden used in robocalls, can mislead people into thinking that people have said things that they haven’t said.

Start training on multi-TB datasets immediately, without complex setups, downloading, no "disk out of space", or 429 “stop requesting!” errors.It's super fast! Outrunning our local SSDs when training on 64xH100 with 256 workers downloading data.
We've improved streaming to have 100x fewer requests, → 10× faster data resolution → 2x sample/sec, → 0 worker crashes at 256 concurrent workers. Loading data, especially at the terabyte scale, is a major pain in any machine learning workflow. We suffered this while training SmolLM3, at one point we had to wait 3 hours before each run to download enough data. Streaming has always been possible in the datasets library, but large scale training with massive datasets remained a challenge. That

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles The past year has been all about giving LLMs more tools and autonomy to solve more complex and open ended tasks. The goal of the Jupyter Agent is to give the model the ultimate tool: code execution. A natural way to display multi-step code execution together with reasoning is within a Jupyter Notebook, which consists of code and markdown cells. So we built Jupyter Agent to act as an agent that can execute code directly inside a Jupyter notebook and use this environment to solve data analysis and data science tasks. Think of it like Cursor, but living natively inside your data science workflow.We built a demo of this vision with Qwen-3 Coder, currently one of the strongest coding models. This is a follow-up to our earlier work on jupyter-agent (v1).
While large models are starting to show useful behavior, the key question is how we can continue improving them. To this end, we focus on strengthening smaller models to perform well on agentic data science tasks as they currently struggle to compete with the large models.
The goal of this project is to build a pipeline to first generate high-quality training data, then fine-tune an existing small model, and finally evaluate whether the model's performance improves on relevant benchmarks.

Back to Articles Future of AI Most current AI benchmarks focus on answering questions about the past, either by testing models on existing knowledge (in a static manner, such as HLE or GPQA, or augmented, like BrowseComp or GAIA) or previously solved problems (like PaperBench, DABStep, or most coding evaluations). However, we believe that more valuable AI, and ultimately AGI, will be distinguished by its ability to use this past to forecast interesting aspects of the future, rather than merely reciting old facts.
Forecasting future events is a complex and holistic task: it requires sophisticated reasoning, synthesis, weighing probabilities and genuine understanding, rather than pattern matching against or searching existing information. Evaluating models on their ability to predict future outcomes, whether in science, economics, geopolitics, or technology tests the kind of intelligence that creates real-world value.
Beyond its inherent importance, this forecasting-based approach also solves many methodological problems faced by current evaluations and benchmarks. Traditional benchmarks that measure accuracy on fixed test sets are inevitably affected by possible data contamination, and without access to the full reproduci

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) extends traditional LLM training by optimizing not just a single-turn response, but an entire decision-making process learned through direct interaction with an environment during training. Unlike traditional single-turn reinforcement learning or offline preference-based methods that rely on static datasets, agentic RL trains policies by actively collecting on-policy data as the agent plans actions, invokes tools, observes outcomes, and adapts its behavior over multi-step trajectories in either simulated or real environments. This interaction-driven optimization assigns credit across long-horizon decisions, where intermediate choices such as query reformulation, tool selection, and execution order directly influence downstream success. Training follows an iterative closed loop in which the agent interacts with the environment to collect rollout trajectories, computes rewards over these trajectories, updates the policy based on observed outcomes, and then uses the updated policy to drive the next round of interaction and data collection such as GRPO or PPO algorithms..

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles The Real Agent Alignment Problem: Benchmarks or Reality? The Need for Interleaved Thinking True Generalization is About Perturbation What's Next? Getting Involved It's been fantastic to see the community dive into our new MiniMax M2, with many highlighting its impressive skills in complex agentic tasks. This is particularly exciting for me, as my work was centered on the agent alignment part of its post-training. In this post, I'd like to share some of the key insights and lessons we learned during that process. The Real Agent Alignment Problem: Benchmarks or Reality? If you've worked with LLM Agents, you've felt this pain: the same model can feel brilliant in one framework and useless in another. An agent might crush a tool-use leaderboard but fail spectacularly at a simple, real-world task. This gap between benchmark performance and practical usability is one of the biggest challenges in the field.
When we designed M2, we knew we had to tackle this problem head-on. This led us to two core, and sometimes conflicting, objectives: Excel on Open-Source Benchmarks. Benchmarks are essential for measuring "pure" capabilities. A benchmark like BrowseComp, for instance, tests for sophisticated search

Back to Articles The Problem The Solution The RFCs Use cases What’s Next With tools like TRL, TorchForge and verl, the open-source community has shown how to scale AI across complex compute infrastructure. But compute is only one side of the coin. The other side is the developer community; the people and tools that make agentic systems possible. That’s why Meta and Hugging Face are partnering to launch the OpenEnv Hub: a shared and open community hub for agentic environments.
Agentic environments define everything an agent needs to perform a task: the tools, APIs, credentials, execution context, and nothing else. They bring clarity, safety, and sandboxed control to agent behavior.
These environments can be used for both training and deployment, and serve as the foundation for scalable agentic development. The Problem Modern AI agents can act autonomously across thousands of tasks. However, a large language model isn’t enough to get those tasks to actually run — it needs access to the right tools. Exposing millions of tools directly to a model isn’t reasonable (or safe). Instead, we need agentic e

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles TL;DR – We’re excited to introduce the beta version of the Retrieval Embedding Benchmark (RTEB), a new benchmark designed to reliably evaluate the retrieval accuracy of embedding models for real-world applications. Existing benchmarks struggle to measure true generalization, while RTEB addresses this with a hybrid strategy of open and private datasets. Its goal is simple: to create a fair, transparent, and application-focused standard for measuring how models perform on data they haven’t seen before.
The performance of many AI applications, from RAG and agents to recommendation systems, is fundamentally limited by the quality of search and retrieval. As such, accurately measuring the retrieval quality of embedding models is a common pain point for developers. How do you really know how well a model will perform in the wild?
This is where things get tricky. The current standard for evaluation often relies on a model's "zero-shot" performance on public benchmarks. However, this is, at best, an approximation of a model's true generalization capabilities. When models are repeatedly evaluated against the same public datasets, a gap emerges between their reported scores and their actual performance on new, unseen data. Performance Di

Back to Articles Enter SyGra: One Framework for Every Data Challenge Why SyGra Matters SyGra Architecture Final Thoughts References When we think about building a model - be it a Large Language Model (LLM) or a Small Language Model (SLM) - the first thing we need is data. While a vast amount of open data is available, it rarely comes in the exact format required to train or align models.
In practice, we often face scenarios where the raw data isn't enough. We need data that is more structured, domain-specific, complex, or aligned with the task at hand. Let's look at some common situations: Complex Scenarios Missing You start with a simple dataset, but the model fails on advanced reasoning tasks. How do you generate more complex datasets to strengthen performance? Knowledge Base to Q&amp;A You already have a knowledge base, but it's not in Q&amp;A format.

Each episode of HBO's The Pitt features some degree of medical trauma that almost makes the hospital drama feel like a horror series. Some patients are dealing with gnarly lacerations while others are fighting off vicious blood infections that could rob them of their limbs, and the chaos of working in an emergency room often leaves The Pitt's central characters shaken. But as alarming as many of The Pitt's more gore-forward moments can be, what's even more unsettling is the show's slow-burning subplot about hospitals adopting generative artificial intelligence.
In its second season, The Pitt once again chronicles all the events that happen …

### 12. `EN` [The best earbuds we’ve tested for 2026](data/articles/5487d9ae2c5724b9b8d76fb0f9ffbea0.html)
**Source:** The Verge | **Keyword:** `AI`
It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds, when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations, companies like Sony, Apple, Bose, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.
Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on. The best wireless earbuds for most people
Sony WF-1000XM5 Score: 8 ProsCons Smaller, more comfortable design
Upgrades to ANC and sound quality
Much clearer voice call performance Glossy texture can make them harder to remove from case
Sony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors Where to Buy: $329.99 $248 at Amazon $329.99 $248 at Walmart $329.99 $248 at Best Buy Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)
Despite the recent arrival of Sony’s WF-1000XM6 earbuds, the last-gen WF-1000XM5 remain our top recommendation for the best noise-canceling earbuds overall. Thanks to their larger drivers, audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. They also deliver fantastic active noise cancellation, even if it’s not quite as impressive as it is on the newer XM6 or Bose’s Ultra Earbuds gen 2. The XM5 do a terrific job of eliminating background noise, and battery life can stretch to eight hours with ANC turned on.
Some people found the XM4 bulky and uncomfortable, but Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent (the XM6 are longer and narrower). Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and there’s even a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.
On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.
None of that to say the newer XM6 are a bad choice — quite the contrary, actually. Sony’s latest flagships offer improved sound, handle ambient noise better during calls, and deliver some of the best ANC you can get in a pair of wireless earbuds. But they’re also bulkier and pricier than the XM5 given the latter can often be found on sale for around $250, making the last-gen model a better option for most people.
Read our full WF-1000XM5 review.
The best budget earbuds under $100
Nothing Ear (a)
Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow. They combine decent ANC, enjoyable sound, and other features like multipoint for under $100. Score: 7 ProsCons Standout color and design
Very compact carrying case
Great performer for the price Limited retail availability
Plastic case can show scuffs Where to Buy: $89 $79 at Nothing $109 $79 at Amazon Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)
When looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. And the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point, especially since they often can be found for as little as $60. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ear 3, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.

The best noise-canceling earbuds
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen)
The second generation of the Bose Ultra Earbuds carry over the chunky design from the previous gen, with improved ANC and call quality. Score: 8 ProsCons Exceptional ANC
Secure fit
Wireless charging case Bulky design
Merely average battery life Where to Buy: $299 $249.99 at Amazon $299 at Bose $299 $269 at Best Buy Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)
The name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen model bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.
Although Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.
As with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.

The best earbuds for sports and working out
Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 Score: 8 ProsCons Huzzah! Wireless charging!
Adds ANC, transparency modes, spatial audio
Slimmer ear hook, smaller case
Adds heart rate
Great sound
No price hike Case is still a chonker
Heart rate is not that useful for iOS users Where to Buy: $250 $212.49 at Amazon $249 at Walmart $249.99 at Best Buy Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)
After a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.
The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users. The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.
If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. Read our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.
The best earbuds for iPhone owners
AirPods Pro 3 Score: 9 ProsCons Improved ANC and sound
Longer battery
Standalone workout tracking
Live translation
Same price
IP57
Better fit
Camera remote control is handy! If you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that Where to Buy: $249 $229 at Amazon $249.99 at Best Buy $249 $229 at Walmart Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)
Apple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features at the end of 2024. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and longer battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.
The new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, when combined with better ANC performance, deliver the best overall noise cancellation in a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is nearly identical to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (though some people might not notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.
But what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, first seen with the Powerbeats Pro 2, enables heart rate tracking for 50 workout types from directly within the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data. Read our full AirPods Pro 3 review.
The best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners
Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro
The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are Samsung’s best-sounding wireless earbuds yet. They have a stemmed design similar to the AirPods Pro, but even if their design is a little bland, the Buds 3 Pro make up for it with great call quality, useful voice commands, and more. Score: 8 ProsCons Terrific sound quality
Crisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode
Voice commands are simple and so useful
Good voice calls Uninspired design
Midtier noise cancellation performance
No true multipoint Where to Buy: $249.99 $199.99 at Amazon $249.99 $169.88 at Walmart $249.99 $179.99 at Target Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)
Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.
The Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.
But they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
L’hiver le plus implacable du XXᵉ siècle Deux ans après le traumatisme de février 1954, la France replonge dans l’hiver le plus implacable du XXᵉ siècle. Février 1956 s’annonce d’une brutalité inédite. Tout commence le 30 janvier : en moins de quarante-huit heures, les températures s’effondrent de 20 à 25 °C. Le choc est violent, meurtrier. Une quarantaine de personnes perdent la vie dès les premiers jours. Le froid s’installe, s’étend, s’obstine. Il ne desserre son étau que le 28 février, après avoir paralysé l’ensemble du pays et une grande partie de l’Europe. À Paris, la température moyenne du mois chute à - 4,2 °C, un niveau digne d’un mois de février à Oslo. Jamais le XXᵉ siècle n’a connu pareil froid. Les sols, gorgés d’eau, durcissent comme du béton. Les cultures d’hiver — avoine, blé, colza — sont ravagées. Dans de nombreuses régions, les champs devront être entièrement réensemencés au printemps. Pour les agriculteurs, la facture est colossale. Des températures historiques dans le Sud Dans le sud, l’épisode prend une dimension historique. Février 1956 devient le mois le plus froid jamais observé depuis le début des relevés, peut-être même depuis les hivers mythiques de 1709 ou 1684. ` Le 2 février, l’air glacial s’engouffre dans la vallée du Rhône et déclenche un mistral d’une violence extrême : des rafales atteignent 180 km/h à Istres, 160 km/h à Orange avec un ressenti de -30, compte tenu des températures extrêmement basses au thermomètre . La presqu’île de Saint-Tropez se retrouve coupée du monde. La neige s’accumule, jusqu’à 60 centimètres, formant des congères de plus de trois mètres. Sur la Côte d’Azur, le décor est surréaliste. À Saint-Raphaël et Antibes, le poids de la neige écrase les serres, ruine les cultures florales et maraîchères. Les dégâts dépassent les 600 millions de francs. La neige tient jusqu’au 15 mars. Dans le sud de la vallée du Rhône, près de 800 000 oliviers sont détruits, certains gelés jusqu’à la racine. Les indemnisations, elles, se feront attendre pendant des années. L’aéroport de Nice ferme à plusieurs reprises. Winston Churchill, bloqué cinq heures sur place, finit par regagner Londres. Le Carnaval de Nice est interrompu par la neige. À Cannes, où l’on mesure jusqu’à 50 centimètres au sol, la fête des mimosas est annulée. Orangers et citronniers sont décimés, certaines plantations disparaissent à jamais, comme celles de la vallée du Loup, près de Grasse. Le littoral de la Côte d'Azur coupé du monde, après la tempête de neige du 1er février 1956 - archives meteo-paris.com Même le Rhône et certains ports gèlent partiellement !! Un léger redoux autour du 5 février laisse espérer une accalmie. Illusion. Dès le 7, le froid sibérien revient avec une intensité redoublée et ne lâche plus prise jusqu’à la fin du mois. La France vit alors au rythme d’un pays du Grand Nord. Les rivières gèlent, les ports se figent. À Tarascon, un bras du Rhône est pris par la glace sur trois kilomètres. Près de Marseille, l’étang de Berre se solidifie à son tour, tout comme un bassin du Vieux-Port à partir de la mi-février. À Paris, le lac du Bois de Boulogne devient une patinoire improvisée où l’on organise un match de hockey sur glace. À Saint-Fargeau, près de Melun, des centaines de curieux viennent chaque jour observer la Seine entièrement gelée. La Saône totalement gelée à 20 km au nord de Lyon en février 1956 - archives meteo-paris.com Jusqu'à -32°C à Sarreguemines ! Les records de froid tombent les uns après les autres : –12 °C à Saint-Raphaël, –17 °C à Marseille et Paris, –21 °C à Lyon, –25 °C à Nancy, jusqu’à –32 °C à Sarreguemines. À Strasbourg, 160 aiguillages ferroviaires gèlent, paralysant une grande partie du trafic. Températures minimales en février 1956 - carte meteo-villes.com 80 cm de neige dans les rues de Bordeaux ! Le 21 février, une tempête de neige isole l’Aquitaine. À Bordeaux, on mesure jusqu’à 80 centimètres dans les rues. L’armée est appelée en renfort. Usines, écoles, grands magasins ferment. La radio devient le principal lien avec l’extérieur. Le maire, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, bloqué à Paris, dirige la gestion de crise à distance pour assurer en priorité l’approvisionnement en pain et en lait. Les congères dépassent deux mètres dans certaines zones de Gironde, notamment vers Arcachon. Sur le littoral, le gel provoque un désastre. Les parcs ostréicoles d’Oléron sont détruits. La mer gèle sur près d’un kilomètre. À l’île de Ré, la misère s’installe : trois cents pêcheurs de pétoncles, venus de Noirmoutier, se retrouvent piégés, affamés, transis. Les enfants mangent des pommes de terre gelées. En Corse aussi, la neige bloque des villes du littoral. À Ajaccio, les denrées sont rationnées : cinquante kilos de pommes de terre par épicier. Les vignobles français, y compris en Alsace, enregistrent des pertes pouvant atteindre 50 %. Le centre de Bordeaux totalement bloqué sous 80 cm de neige... photo exclusive meteo-paris.com La vague de froid ne s’arrête pas aux frontières. Elle gagne l’Afrique du Nord. Les côtes hollandaises gèlent. Des pêcheurs restent prisonniers des glaces pendant quatre jours. À Hambourg, les cargos attendent des semaines avant de pouvoir quitter le port. La Baltique se transforme en barrière de glace, isolant la Suède. En Italie, la neige tombe sans discontinuer pendant cent heures sur certaines régions. Des centaines de villages sont coupés du monde. Près de Naples, 40 centimètres de neige recouvrent les rues, tandis que des chômeurs affamés manifestent dans le sud. À la fin du mois, les stocks de charbon sont au plus bas. Les États-Unis envoient en urgence 140 000 tonnes. Les services des ponts et chaussées redoutent désormais le dégel. Sur la Seine, d’énormes blocs de glace menacent les ouvrages. Le vieux pont de Sainte-Assise est condamné, incapable de résister aux « icebergs » charriés par le fleuve. D’autres ponts subissent le même sort. Le bilan est terrible : près de 12 000 morts en France. Et tandis que la presse commence à proposer des prévisions météorologiques de plus en plus détaillées, le pays accuse encore un retard sur l’Angleterre, où un bulletin météo complet est déjà accessible par téléphone… au prix d’un simple appel ordinaire.

La neige est très abondante à Val d'Isère en Savoie actuellement ! - Photographie : Station Val d'Isère Même si la neige reste timide en plaine depuis le début du mois de janvier sur la France, le constat est tout autre en montagne. Avec le temps très humide et perturbé de ces dernières semaines, la neige se montre en effet particulièrement abondante sur la majorité de nos massifs, notamment en moyenne montagne où l'épaisseur est parfois impressionnante, même pour une mi-février. Nous vous proposons donc un petit tour de nos massifs. Enneigement MOYEN par massif en bas et en haut des pistes au vendredi 13 février 2026 - relevés Météo-France Voici la liste des stations de sports d'hiver les plus enneigées en haut des pistes (source : Meteo-France) : Piau Engaly : 350 cm La Rosière 1850 : 300 cm Puy Saint-Vincent : 279 cm Saint-François-Longchamp : 265 cm Bonneval sur Arc : 262 cm Flaine : 260 cm Alpe d’Huez : 255 cm Praloup : 255 cm Arêches-Beaufort : 240 cm Chamrousse : 237 cm Les 2 Alpes : 235 cm Alpes C'est sur la partie nord du massif que les quantités de neige sont les plus importantes en station en cette mi-février 2026. On relève en effet en général entre 90 et 110 cm de neige en bas des pistes de la Haute-Savoie au Queyras en passant par l'Isère, parfois plus comme au Grand-Bornand (74) à 1430m d'altitude où on mesure 155 cm de neige ce 13 février. Les quantités sont en général comprises entre 200 et 300 cm en haut des pistes, là aussi des valeurs particulièrement élevées. L'enneigement est exceptionnel à La Rosière (Savoie), ce vendredi 13 février 2026 - cliché Alexandra Brochard via @MeteoExpress Attention toutefois, ces quantités de neige particulièrement importantes entraînent un risque d'avalanche très élevé en cette fin de semaine. Plusieurs avalanches notables ont d'ailleurs été observées ce jeudi 12 février sur le nord des Alpes. Le sud du massif n'est pas non plus en reste avec là aussi des quantités notables. On mesure en général entre 40 et 60 cm de neige en bas des pistes dans les stations des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence et des Alpes-Maritimes et jusqu'à 200 cm sur les sommets. La nivôse de Millefonts (06) mesure par exemple 147 cm de neige à 2430 m d'altitude, soit 86 cm de plus que l'année dernière à la même période ! Pyrénées Le massif pyrénéen est également particulièrement concerné par les chutes de neige ces dernières semaines. Que ce soit l'est ou l'ouest du massif, toutes les stations observent d'importantes quantités de neige en cette mi-février 2026. Certains secteurs des Pyrénées-Orientales ont même relevé des quantités de neige qui n'avaient plus été vues depuis près de 30 ans et d'autres ont atteint des records au début du mois de février ! Si les quantités restent raisonnables en bas des pistes (entre 20 et 40 cm en général) en raison de plusieurs redoux plus ou moins notables depuis le début du mois de février, on relève le plus souvent 200 à 250 cm de neige sur les sommets ! Corse Comme pour les Pyrénées et les Alpes, le temps agité et très humide de ces dernières semaines a apporté une couche de neige particulièrement importante sur les massifs de l'île de beauté. Celle-ci est même plus importante que dans certains massifs alpins avec en général entre 30 et 50 cm à moyenne altitude et jusqu'à 250 cm sur sommets de la région, localement plus ! On relève par exemple 277 cm à la nivôse de Maniccia (2360m), 157 cm de plus que l'année dernière à la même date et presque 2 m de plus qu'en février 2024 ! La station de Bastelica dans le Val d'Ese a même pu rouvrir ses portes au début du mois de février après 3 ans sans neige ! Les autres massifs français sont malheureusement un peu moins bien fournis en terme de neige car moins élevés. L'air globalement assez doux pour la période a en effet limité les chutes de neige abondante sur le Jura, les Vosges et le Massif Central ces dernières semaines en plus de quelques journées de pluie jusqu'aux sommets de ces massifs, entraînant un lessivage parfois notable. On ne relève en général pas plus de 20-25 cm sur les sommets de ces reliefs, ce qui est à contrario déficitaire. Encore et toujours des chutes de neige en vue ! D'autres chutes de neige abondantes sont prévues d'ici la fin du mois (et notamment d'ici le 24 février) à tel point qu'il pourrait encore tomber 1 m à 2,50 m supplémentaires en haut des pistes, notamment sur le nord des Alpes et l'Ouest des Pyrénées ! Les épaisseurs pourraient ainsi atteindre localement 5 m voire davantage...

Crue majeure de la Loire à Béhuard (49) ce mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Jérémy Girault De nombreux cours d'eau débordent dans l'ouest de la France et certaines crues sont majeures. La situation ne va pas s'arranger car de nouvelles pluies copieuses sont prévues dans les prochaines heures. Notre article fait le point sur la situation. Crues majeures et nouvelles pluies à venir La situation reste particulièrement tendue d'un point de vue hydrométrique dans la moitié ouest de la France où de nombreux cours d'eau étaient encore en vigilance orange ce mardi 17 février 2026. Certains tronçons sont même en vigilance ROUGE : la Garonne marmandaise et girondine, la Loire saumuroise et les basses vallées angevines et, plus dernièrement, la Charente-aval. Ces tronçons de l'ouest de la France subissent actuellement des crues majeures et, pour certains, vont encore monter dans les prochaines heures. Carte de vigilance des cours d'eau émise le mardi 17 février 2026 à 16h - Vigicrues Pour ne rien arranger, la pluie n'en finit plus de tomber. Une nouvelle onde pluvieuse gagne le nord-ouest de la France en nuit du mardi 17 au mercredi 18 février 2026 et plusieurs passages pluvieux balayeront l'hexagone mercredi et jeudi. Sur les 48 prochaines heures, il faut s'attendre à plusieurs dizaines de millimètres supplémentaires sur tout le nord, le centre et l'ouest de la France, ainsi que dans les Alpes. Les cumuls vont atteindre 50 à 70 mm dans l'ouest et le sud de la Bretagne et sur le sud-ouest du Massif Central, sur des sols déjà saturés ! L'ampleur des crues va donc encore croître... Cumuls de pluie modélisés les mercredi 18 et jeudi 19 février 2026 - meteologix.com Plusieurs secteurs lourdement impactés Si la Garonne a atteint son pic dimanche et a depuis entamé une très lente décrue, le pire est encore à venir dans le Maine-et-Loire où plusieurs cours d'eau ont été placés en vigilance ROUGE. Ce niveau maximal d'alerte concerne la Mayenne, Loire, la Maine et la Sarthe dans les basses vallées angevines. Ce mardi 17 février 2026, la crue de la Maine causait des inondations notables sur la promenade de Reculée à Angers et le niveau va continuer de monter probablement jusqu'au milieu de la semaine. Crue importante du Maine à Angers (49) ce mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Jean Ruaud En après-midi de mardi, les services de Vigicrues ont déclenché la vigilance ROUGE en Charente-Maritime.

À Cognac dans le département voisin de la Charente, le fleuve atteignait 7,75 mètres en fin d'après-midi du mardi 17 février 2026, 16 cm au dessus de la crue de décembre 2023. En Charente-Maritime, les inondations les plus importantes sont prévues en milieu de semaine avec plusieurs dizaines de centimètres supplémentaires prévus à Saintes, où la crue de 2023 est déjà dépassée.

Le dernier mois réellement hivernal en France remonte à février 2018, marqué par deux épisodes importants de chutes de neige et par des températures particulièrement basses, atteignant des niveaux qui n’ont pas (encore) été observés cette année. Sur les 95 vagues de froid observées en France depuis 1900, seule une vague de froid a été observée après 2015 et aucune depuis 2020… La dernière, date donc de février 2018... Source : Serge Saka Une première vague de froid au début du mois Entre le 4 et le 9 février 2018, la France replonge en plein hiver. Un puissant épisode de froid et de neige concerne près des deux tiers du pays, paralysant temporairement plusieurs régions. Tout commence le 5 février, lorsqu’une perturbation venue de Méditerranée remonte vers le nord. La neige tombe jusqu’en plaine sur le Massif central, gagne la vallée du Rhône, la Bourgogne, puis atteint l’Île-de-France en fin de journée. Le 6 février, la situation se complique nettement. Un épisode neigeux majeur frappe l’Île-de-France et les Pays de la Loire. Les chutes deviennent soutenues et tiennent au sol, y compris dans la capitale. Les conséquences sont spectaculaires : un record de 739 kilomètres d’embouteillages est enregistré autour de Paris, piégeant de nombreux automobilistes. Au matin du 7 février, le paysage est est blanc sur les 2/3 du territoire avec une épaisseurs de neige remarquables dans le Bassin parisien. On mesure jusqu’à 25 cm de neige localement, notamment à Vendôme, Dreux ou Versailles, et 12 cm à Paris-Montsouris. Le 8 février, le ciel se dégage mais le froid s’intensifie. Sur des sols enneigés, les températures plongent entre –13°C et –14°C localement, et descendent autour de –6°C à –7°C dans les aéroports parisiens. Enfin, le 9 février, une nouvelle perturbation océanique traverse l’air froid et apporte de nouvelles chutes de neige du Massif central vers l’Île-de-France et le nord du pays, prolongeant cet épisode hivernal marquant. La neige des 6 et 7 février 2018 à Paris où il tombe 12 cm - meteo-paris.com et Alexandre Slowik Une seconde vague de froid, intense, à la fin du mois Du lundi 26 février au jeudi 1er mars 2018, un puissant flux d’air glacial venu de l’est, surnommé le “Moscou-Paris”, envahit une grande partie de l’Europe continentale. Il provoque en France une vague de froid courte mais intense, d’abord sèche, puis accompagnée de neige. Un premier épisode neigeux concerne l’extrême Sud-Est entre le 26 et le 27 février, lié à une instabilité débordant d’Italie. La neige tombe jusqu’en plaine et même sur le littoral entre le Var, les Alpes-Maritimes et l’est des Bouches-du-Rhône. Elle atteint Nice, Menton et surtout Ajaccio, qui se réveille le 27 février sous 15 cm de neige. La nuit des 27-28 février est glaciale sur l’ensemble du pays, avec des températures descendant sous –10°C sur près de la moitié de la France, y compris en Île-de-France, dans le Nord et le Centre.

Voiture écrasée par un arbre à Perpignan au passage de la tempête Nils ce jeudi 12 février 2026 - photo Arpy Cod La tempête Nils a frappé encore plus durement que prévu dans le sud-ouest de la France et jusqu'en Méditerranée. On a mesuré jusqu'à 180 km/h dans les Pyrénées-Orientales et une personne a perdu la vie dans les Landes. Jusqu'à 180 km/h : Nils encore plus forte que prévu ! Les services de Météo France avait anticipé la virulente de la tempête Nils, plaçant la Vendée et de nombreux départements du sud-ouest de la France ainsi que la Corse en vigilance orange tempête. Le département de l'Aude avait été placé en vigilance ROUGE dès mercredi après-midi. À la vue des rafales de vent encore plus importantes que prévu, l'alerte rouge a été étendue aux départements des Pyrénées-Orientales jeudi matin. Carte de vigilance en vigueur le matin du jeudi 12 février 2026 - Météo France Et pour cause, les rafales de vent enregistrées au passage de la tempête Nils ont dépassé la prévision ! Dans la nuit, le sud-ouest a subi des rafales remarquables avec 157 km/h au Cap Ferret sur le littoral aquitain ! Ces vents très violents ne se sont pas limités à la côte. Dans les terres, on a mesuré 132 km/h à Toulouse, 134 km/h à Tarbes, 136 km/h à Mont-de-Marsan et 145 km/h à Pau ! Le matin, Aude et Pyrénées-Orientales ont subi des vents remarquables avec 149 km/h à Perpignan, 158 km/h à Leucate et même jusqu'à 180 km/h à Caixas ! Bien souvent, il s'agit de la plus forte tempête dans ces régions depuis Klaus en 2009 ! La Corse fut aussi fortement affectée jusqu'à 185 km/h à Cagnano dans le Cap Corse ! Rafales maximales de la tempête Nils le jeudi 12 février 2026 - keraunos.org 1 victime et de gros dégâts Les vents particulièrement puissants ont causé de très nombreuses chutes d'arbres dans tout le sud-ouest de la France et près de la Méditerranée. De plus, les sols gorgés en eau ont rendu le déracinement des arbres plus aisé. En matinée du jeudi 12 février 2026, la circulation a été fortement perturbée sur de nombreux axes routiers, y compris sur l'A9 où plusieurs pins sont tombés sur les voies. Un poids lourd a percuté l'un d'eux, blessant légèrement son chauffeur. Plus tôt dans la nuit, un routier de 55 ans a perdu la vie dans les Landes, touché par la chute d'un arbre traversant son pare-brise. Poids lourd ayant percuté un pin tombé sur l'A9 à Lespignan (34) le matin du jeudi 12 février 2026 - photo SDIS34 L'intensité de cette tempête a surpris autant les habitants que les météorologues avec des rafales un ou deux crans au dessus des valeurs initialement prévues. Les chutes d'arbres se comptent par milliers dans le sud-ouest de la France, y compris dans les grandes villes. Celles-ci ont occasionné de très nombreuses pannes d'électricité. En matinée du jeudi 12 février 2026, jusqu'à 900.000 foyers étaient privés d'électricité !

La neige du mardi 6 février 2018 au soir à Paris 9e (square Montholon) - archives meteo-paris.com Nous avons choisi de vous présenter des cartes précises d’épaisseur de neige prévue d’ici la fin du mois de février, non pas par démagogie (car nous sommes conscients que ces scénarios évolueront dans les prochains jours), mais pour illustrer la tendance qui se dessine pour la fin du mois. En effet, tous les modèles météorologiques prévoient au moins deux ou trois épisodes de neige en plaine, bien que les timings, les épaisseurs et les régions concernées varient d’un modèle à l’autre. Nous avons opté pour le scénario du modèle météorologique européen, car il sert de référence aux prévisions nationales, même s’il est loin d’être parfait. Neige de dimanche : éphémère avec des différences selon les prévisions Les chutes de neige de dimanche toucheront principalement les régions du Nord au Massif central, en matinée, avant de se décaler vers le nord-est l’après-midi. Depuis quelques heures la plupart des scénarios indiquent des épaisseurs plus importantes et suivent le modèle météo européen qui a toujours été plus neigeux que les autres. Les fourchettes basses des météo arpège, européen et Icône indiquent des épaisseurs comprises entre 0 et 3 cm. Simulation de l'épaisseur de neige prévue pour dimanche 15 février par le modèles météo ARPÈGE (français) - Meteociel En revanche, les fourchette hautes du modèle météo arôme indiquent 1 à 10/12 cm : presque rien dans les vallées (et peut-être seulement une neige ne tenant pas au sol dans Paris) et jusqu'à 10 cm sur certains plateaux. Cette possible grande différence sera liée à la température au moment où auront lieu les précipitations, car il fera entre 0 et +1°C. Il suffira donc de sortir de l'îlot de chaleur des agglomérations et de monter sur les plateaux à plus de 100 à 150 m d'altitude pour passer d'un paysage sans neige à un paysage très enneigé. Simulation de l'épaisseur de neige prévue pour dimanche 15 février par les modèles météo ARÔME (français) et européen - Meteociel Nouvelles possibilités de neige la semaine prochaine Cet épisode neigeux sera suivi d’un puissant redoux, mais temporaire. La semaine prochaine, la France se trouvera entre l’air doux au sud et l’air plus froid au nord, au cœur d’un puissant courant hésitant entre une influence océanique polaire et une influence océanique des Açores. Une nouvelle chute de neige pourrait avoir lieu au nord de la Seine mercredi matin, car une dépression pourrait circuler sur ces régions, apportant de la neige au nord de son centre. Samedi 21 ou dimanche 22, une descente froide pourrait également se produire, accompagnée d’une forte instabilité et de possibles averses de neige jusqu’en plaine, notamment entre le Massif central et les régions du nord-est. Plusieurs possibilité également pour la fin du mois Enfin, en milieu de semaine suivante (aux alentours de mercredi 25 ou jeudi 26 février), le courant océanique pourrait être particulièrement vigoureux, mais l’air froid resterait sur le nord de la France, avec des scénarios très neigeux au nord de la Seine. Selon le modèle météo Européen, les deux tiers de la France seraient sous la neige sur cette carte. Il s'agit ici d'un scénario assez isolé, mais qui mérite d'être signalé.

Le flux basculera temporairement au nord ce week-end avec un refroidissement permettant le retour de la neige jusqu'en plaine. Notre article fait le point sur les régions qui devraient voir tomber les flocons samedi et dimanche. Bref refroidissement ce week-end Dans le sillon de la tempête Nils, un autre minimum dépressionnaire se creusera vers les Baléares durant la journée du vendredi 13 février 2026, se décalant ensuite vers la Corse puis l'Italie durant ce week-end des 14 et 15 février. À l'arrière de cette dépression, la France basculera en flux de secteur nord dès la journée du samedi 14 février. L'air froid actuellement présent sur la Mer du Nord va donc s'engouffrer sur l'hexagone durant la Saint-Valentin. La douceur cèdera sa place à une ambiance plus hivernale. Température de la masse d'air à 850 hPa (vers 1500m) le dimanche 15 février 2026 à minuit - wxcharts.com Malgré tout, il ne s'agira absolument pas d'une offensive hivernale majeure - et encore moins durable. En effet, une nouvelle dépression gagnera le nord-ouest des Îles Britanniques dès le dimanche 15 février 2026 avec une nouvelle accélération du flux d'ouest sur le proche-Atlantique, gagnant déjà l'ouest de la France avec un air océanique plus doux dès la journée de dimanche. Où va-t-il neiger samedi et dimanche ? La bascule en flux de nord causera le décalage d'un front vers l'est de la France et les Pyrénées le samedi 14 février 2026. En plaine, la masse d'air ne sera pas encore assez froide pour que la neige vienne blanchir les sols. Quelques flocons pourront tomber jusqu'aux altitudes les plus basses en fin de front dans l'est, mais sans conséquence. En revanche, il tombera plusieurs centimètres dès la basse montagne. On peut s'attendre à des sols blanchis dès 400m sur les Vosges, 600-700 mètres pour le Jura, le Massif Central et les Alpes avec souvent 5 cm dans les stations. Il neigera plus abondamment dans les Pyrénées où on attend 15 à 25 cm dans les stations et des sols blanchis dès 800 mètres. Risque de neige pour le samedi 14 février 2026 - Météo Villes La journée la plus intéressante à suivre sera celle du dimanche 15 février 2026. Une perturbation arrivera par les régions océaniques avec pluie et douceur. En arrivant sur l'air froid, elle pourrait être précédée de chutes de neige en seconde partie de nuit et matinée du Limousin à la Normandie et jusqu'au bassin parisien. Selon les dernières modélisations, une petite couche est possible avec 1 à 3 cm (tenue plus aisée sur les hauteurs). Le front perdrait en activité en gagnant la Champagne et la Bourgogne mais pourrait se réactiver le soir sur les régions frontalières du nord-est, où la neige pourrait aussi blanchir temporairement les sols, avant que la pluie ne prenne le relais. Risque de neige pour le dimanche 15 février 2026 - Météo Villes Pour l'heure, il existe encore des incertitudes sur les régions qui seront concernées par la neige et sur l'activité de la perturbation. Dans tous les cas, les flocons seront éphémères et la pluie prendra rapidement le relais avec le retour de la douceur dès le lundi 16 février 2026.

### 8. `FR` [Pourquoi pleut-il autant depuis le début de l'année ?](data/articles/f1dd309871e590f5e4636c0fe9e1d43a.html)
**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
La pluie n'en finit plus de tomber sur la France, causant des crues majeures dans la moitié ouest. expliquer qu'il pleut autant depuis le début de l'année et cette situation est-elle exceptionnelle ? Notre article vous explique. Une circulation atmosphérique atypique Depuis le début de l'année 2026, le courant jet circule à des latitudes plus basses qu'en temps normal. Il a longuement ondulé de la côte est des États-Unis vers les Açores avant de passer par la péninsule ibérique et la Méditerranée. Ainsi, il a permis aux dépressions de s'enchaîner sur la péninsule ibérique et la Méditerranée avec des pluies affectant une grande partie de la France. En remontant quelque peu, ce jet passe désormais au dessus de la France et maintient l'agitation. De plus, ajoutons que les vagues de froid nord-américaines ont dynamisé l'activité dépressionnaire sur l'Atlantique. En arrivant au dessus de l'océan, l'air polaire favorise le creusement des dépressions, qui traversent ensuite l'Atlantique vers l'Europe. Schéma montrant la circulation basse en latitude du courant jet fin janvier et début février 2026 - Météo Villes Ainsi, cela fait maintenant plusieurs semaines que l'activité dépressionnaire est particulièrement marquée sur notre pays et globalement sur tout l'ouest de l'Europe. Sur la période du 1er janvier au 15 février 2026, l'anomalie de pression atteint -19 hPa par rapport à la normale au large de la Bretagne ! Un tel déficit sur une période de 45 jours est spectaculaire et témoigne de l'activité dépressionnaire hors norme qu'a subi la France. Si vous consultez régulièrement votre baromètre, vous avez surement remarqué que la pression est souvent très basse depuis le début de l'année 2026. Anomalie de pression du 1er janvier au 15 février 2026 - keraunos.org Des cumuls de pluie vraiment remarquables Sur les 45 premiers jours de l'année, 39 ont enregistré au moins 1 mm de pluie en moyenne nationale ! Cela signifie que 87% des jours ont été pluvieux en France depuis le début 2026, un chiffre remarquable ! Non seulement la pluie a été anormalement fréquente mais elle est aussi anormalement abondante. La Bretagne symbolise cet excès de pluie avec des cumuls tout bonnement remarquables. Au 18 février, il est déjà tombé 566 mm de pluie à Quimper depuis le début de l'année ! Cela représente 260% du cumul normal, c'est à dire qu'il est tombé 2,6 fois plus de pluie que lors d'un début d'année moyen ! Jamais de telles pluies n'avaient été observées depuis le début des mesures. Sur le graphique ci-dessous, on note l'absence d'accalmie avec des courbes qui croissent presque continuellement. Cumuls de pluie sur plusieurs villes bretonnes depuis le début de l'année 2026 - Le Parisien Autre indicateur qui permet de montrer que ce début d'année 2026 est véritablement exceptionnel : l'indice d'humidité des sols atteint des records. En effet, en date du 17 février 2026, l'indice moyenné à échelle nationale est à son plus haut niveau depuis le début des mesures pour cette époque de l'année. D'ailleurs, il arrive même sur le podium des situations où les sols ont été les plus humides en France, toutes dates confondues. Seuls décembre 1982 et janvier 1994, théâtres de graves inondations, avaient connu une humidité moyenne légèrement supérieure à la situation actuelle. Indice d'humidité des sols en moyenne nationale du 18 février 2025 au 17 février 2026 - Météo France En résumé : la situation actuelle est véritablement remarquable avec des crues spectaculaires générées par des pluies parfois records, elles-mêmes liées à une séquence remarquablement dépressionnaire, tant par son intensité que sa durée.

La neige fera son retour en Île-de-France ce dimanche 15 février, tout comme sur d'autres régions du nord et du nord-est de la France - Image d'illustration (vue depuis notre caméra meteo-paris.com) Des chutes de neige relativement éphémères auront lieu ce dimanche jusqu'en plaine entre les Hauts-de-France, tout le Bassin parisien et le nord-est du pays. D'autres épisodes pourraient avoir lieu la semaine prochaine. Retour très bref de la neige en plaine L'invasion polaire continentale qui a eu lieu samedi, fut de courte durée, rapidement remplacée par une poussée océanique plus douce. Si l’air froid persiste sur une grande partie de la France ce dimanche, un nouveau front pluvieux traverse rapidement le pays par l’Ouest. Ce front est accompagné d’un net redoux en altitude, mais la pluie est temporairement précédée de neige pendant quelques heures, là où la couche d’air froid sera suffisamment épaisse. Dimanche matin, la Normandie et l’Île-de-France ont connu des chutes de neige moins importantes que prévues, la perturbation s’étant scindée en deux. La neige a principalement touché un axe s’étendant du Limousin aux Pays de la Loire et au Centre, avant de se réactiver sur les Hauts-de-France, la Champagne-Ardenne et la Lorraine dans l’après-midi et la soirée. Évolution prévue des zones enneigées entre dimanche 8h et lundi 3h – (réactualisation de dimanche 6h - Modèle CEP via meteociel) Quelques centimètres, notamment sur les plateaux Ainsi, les cumul de neige ont été revus à la baisse de la Normandie à l'Île-de-France, mais pas forcément ailleurs. Paris n'a par exemple pas du tout été blanchie. Dimanche en fin de journée, les épaisseurs de neige pourraient dépasser 5 cm entre le nord du département de l'Aisne, ainsi que les Ardennes et le nord de la Lorraine. Épaisseurs de neige maximales prévue pour le dimanche 15 février 2026 (réactualisation de dimanche 6h) – Météo-Villes Une semaine à risque sur les régions du Nord et du nord-est Après le redoux de dimanche après-midi, l’air froid reprendra rapidement le dessus sur la moitié nord dès le début de la semaine. Une dépression, déviée vers le sud par l’air froid persistant au nord, devrait s’échouer sur la France entre mercredi soir et jeudi. Les précipitations, sous cet air froid, pourraient se transformer en neige. Il est cependant encore trop tôt pour déterminer précisément les régions concernées. Des chutes de neige significatives sont possibles, avec un risque accru entre la Normandie, l’Île-de-France et toutes les régions situées au nord de la Seine.

La tempête Nils s'apprête à frapper la France. Elle débutera par l'arc atlantique durant la nuit du mercredi 11 au jeudi 12 février 2026 avant de s'enfoncer en Méditerranée. Dans certains secteurs, les rafales pourront atteindre les 150 km/h ! Tempête de l'Atlantique à la Méditerranée Associée à un vaste zone dépressionnaire, la tempête Nils se présentera sous la forme d'un minimum dépressionnaire qui se creusera au large de nos côtes atlantiques ce mercredi 11 février 2026. Ce dernier s'enfoncera en Manche durant la nuit du mercredi 11 au jeudi 12 février avec un cœur centré autour de 975 hPa. La dépression se décalera ensuite vers le nord de l'Italie. Les vents les plus forts frapperont d'abord l'arc atlantique avant de s'enfoncer sur le sud-ouest de la France puis le bassin méditerranéen. Position de la tempête Nils durant la nuit du mercredi 11 au jeudi 12 février 2026 - meteoblue Ainsi, les rafales tempétueuses débuteront en nuit du mercredi 11 au jeudi 12 février 2026 sur l'arc atlantique avec 100 à 120 km/h, parfois 130 km/h voire très ponctuellement 140 km/h sur le littoral aquitain ! Ces vents tempétueux vont s'enfoncer sur le sud-ouest avec des pointes de 100-110 km/h au sud de la Garonne jusqu'à jeudi matin. C'est dans le domaine de la tramontane et sur l'ouest des Cévennes que la tempête sera la plus violente avec des rafales de 120 à 140 km/h voire 150-160 km/h sur les sommets jusqu'à jeudi après-midi ! Des rafales du même d'ordre frapperont ensuite la montagne corse et les extrémités de l'île. Notons que dans toutes les régions de l'ouest et du centre de la France, des pointes de 80 à 90 km/h (voire localement 100 km/h) pourront être enregistrées. Rafales maximales générées par la tempête Nils en nuit et journée du jeudi 12 février 2026 - Météo Villes Vigilance rouge dans l'Aude ! Ainsi, les services de Météo France ont placé 17 départements allant de la Vendée à la Corse en vigilance orange tempête, débutant en fin de soirée du mercredi 11 février 2026 et se prolongeant jusqu'en fin de journée du jeudi 12 février. L'Aude a été placée en vigilance ROUGE, ce jeudi 6h à 14h avec des pointes de 150 km/h prévues sur la plaine ! Par ailleurs, de très nombreux départements sont en vigilance orange crues. La Garonne marmandaise a même été placée en vigilance ROUGE crue ! Haute-Savoie, Savoie, Isère et Hautes-Alpes sont en vigilance orange avalanches. Carte de vigilance valable ces mercredi 11 et jeudi 12 février 2026 (tempête Nils) - Météo France Avec de telles rafales de vent, il faut s'attendre à des dégâts, en particulier des côtes atlantiques vers le domaine de la tramontane. De plus, cette tempête interviendra dans un contexte très compliqué. En effet, les précipitations abondantes rendent les sols saturés en eau et donc particulièrement meubles. Ainsi, les racines sont moins bien ancrées dans le sol et le vent peut déraciner plus facilement les arbres. Il faut donc s'attendre à de nombreuses chutes d'arbres au passage de cette tempête Nils.

Anomalie de températures en Europe prévue pour mardi 24 février - carte du modèle météo européen Après de longues semaines marquées par une météo très agitée, entre pluies abondantes, vents violents et inondations, la situation commence enfin à s’améliorer. Même si l’hiver n’est pas encore terminé, la fin du mois de février annonce souvent les premiers signes du printemps — et c’est bien ce qui semble se profiler cette année. Retour de l'anticyclone des Açores Depuis plusieurs semaines, l’anticyclone des Açores nous délaisse. Positionné bien trop au sud, il laisse le courant perturbé océanique influencer l’ensemble de l’Europe, y compris la péninsule Ibérique. Dans ce contexte, la France connaît un temps particulièrement instable, ce qui explique des inondations de plus en plus étendues et marquées. La situation s’apprête toutefois à évoluer. Dès ce week-end, les hautes pressions devraient progressivement remonter vers l’Europe continentale. L’anticyclone se centrera alors sur l’Andalousie. Le flux d’ouest océanique restera présent sur la France, mais il sera nettement moins actif : les pluies se cantonneront principalement aux côtes de la Manche. Centres d'action prévus pour la journée de dimanche - modèle météo européen - carte retraitée par Wetteronline et Meteo-villes Parenthèse printanière d'une à deux journées À partir de lundi, et surtout mardi, les hautes pressions se décaleront davantage vers le continent. Le vent s’orientera au sud, favorisant la remontée d’un air très doux en provenance du Maroc. En cette fin février, le soleil gagne déjà en hauteur dans le ciel. Dans une telle configuration, les températures peuvent grimper plus facilement qu’au cœur de l’hiver. La période de la Saint-Valentin marque d’ailleurs souvent le début du réveil de la nature : certains oiseaux entament leur période de reproduction, ce qui serait à l’origine de cette fête. La fin du mois de février offre régulièrement une ou deux journées aux accents printaniers. Mardi devrait illustrer parfaitement cette tendance : le ciel sera enfin dégagé sur les trois quarts du pays et les températures dépasseront fréquemment les 15 °C l’après-midi. Avec un vent de sud soufflant au pied des Pyrénées, le seuil de chaleur pourrait même être approché, voire atteint localement, avec jusqu’à 25 °C sur le Pays basque. Centres d'action prévus pour la journée de mardi - modèle météo européen - carte retraitée par Wetteronline et Meteo-villes Prévisions METEO-VILLES pour la journée de mardi Cette parenthèse printanière pourrait être d'assez courte durée. Dès jeudi, le courant perturbé océanique devrait reprendre le dessus, entraînant le retour des nuages, de quelques pluies par l’ouest et, mécaniquement, des températures un peu moins agréables, même si la douceur restera d’actualité.

Une dépression très creuse va apporter des vents forts et de nouvelles pluies abondantes sur la France en milieu de semaine Vents forts et nouvelles pluies intenses sont attendues au passage d'une dépression bien creuse sur la France entre mercredi 18 et jeudi 19 février 2026. Le niveau de certains cours d'eau étant déjà très élevé, cette nouvelle tempête laisse craindre le pire. Un temps restant agité dans les prochains jours L’influence océanique perturbée persiste en cette mi-février. Sous l’effet d’un courant jet survolant la France, de nouvelles perturbations sont attendues dans les prochains jours, avec plusieurs zones dépressionnaires circulant sur l’ouest de l’Europe jusqu’au week-end. La situation nécessitera une vigilance particulière entre mercredi et jeudi. Une dépression secondaire devrait se former rapidement en marge d’une zone dépressionnaire au large de l’Irlande, se dirigeant vers la Bretagne puis vers l’Italie jeudi. Cette dépression assez creuse devrait entraîner un temps très agité sur le pays, marqué par des vents forts et de fortes précipitations. Vents parfois forts, en limite du niveau de tempête Alors qu’un creusement dépressionnaire notable se dirige vers notre pays, les vents vont se renforcer sur une partie ouest et sud de la France entre mercredi et jeudi. Les vents les plus forts devraient suivre une trajectoire similaire à celle de la tempête Nils, mais heureusement, ils ne devraient pas atteindre la même intensité. C'est donc notamment entre la façade Atlantique, le sud-ouest et les abords de la Méditerranée que les rafales les plus fortes sont attendues entre mercredi soir et jeudi avec parfois plus de 90-100 voire 140 km/h sur les secteurs les plus exposés. Ceci restera néanmoins à confirmer d'ici là. Rafales maximales de vent prévues d'ici vendredi matin, selon le modèle météo européen - via Meteociel Des pluies abondantes et une aggravation des inondations Outre les vents parfois forts, il conviendra également de surveiller le risque de nouvelles fortes précipitations au passage de cette dépression sur notre pays. En effet, entre les pluies parfois abondantes de ce lundi, surtout sur le sud et l'est de la France et le passage de la dépression PEDRO, les cumuls de précipitations s'annoncent de nouveau très importants entre mardi midi et jeudi soir, y compris dans le bassin de la Seine et de la Loire. Cumuls de précipitations attendus entre mardi matin et jeudi soir – Modèle européen via Meteociel Or, ces précipitations toucheront des secteurs déjà particulièrement durement touchées ces dernières semaines, secteurs où les inondations sont déjà nombreuses et parfois importantes depuis la semaine dernière. C'est notamment le cas d'une large partie ouest de la France où la quasi-totalité des cours d'eau sont en crue et où la Garonne, la Loire Saumuroise et les basses vallées angevines subissent une crue historique. Carte Vigicrues du 18 février 2026 à 09h56 Les précipitations de ce début de semaine, suivies du passage de la dépression entre mercredi et jeudi, risquent d’aggraver considérablement la situation actuelle dans ce secteur, laissant craindre des crues généralisées et potentiellement importantes. Un coefficient de marée et une forte houle aggravant la situation Et comme si cela ne suffisait pas, ces intempéries surviennent au plus mauvais moment. Bien qu’il ne s’agisse pas de marées d’équinoxe, les coefficients restent particulièrement élevés (96 et 97), et la houle générée par cette dépression profonde pourrait dépasser les 6 mètres de hauteur sur la façade Atlantique jeudi matin. Cette situation risque de freiner l’écoulement des cours d’eau et, par conséquent, d’aggraver encore davantage les inondations.

Quantités de neige remarquables à La Rosière en Savoie (73) le mercredi 18 février 2026 - photo Météo Tarentaise Les stations des Alpes croulent sous plusieurs mètres de neige, perturbant la vie quotidienne. D'importantes avalanches se déclenchent, coupant parfois les routes d'accès aux stations. Sur place, les images sont impressionnantes ! Parfois 3 mètres dans les stations ! Les quantités de neige sont actuellement remarquables dans la plupart des massifs alpins, notamment entre les Hautes-Alpes, l'Isère, la Savoie et la Haute-Savoie. De nombreuses stations mesurent des quantités inédites depuis de nombreuses années, du fait de la succession d'épisodes perturbés depuis plusieurs semaines. La couche au sol atteint fréquemment entre 2 et 3 mètres vers 2000 mètres dans les stations, comme l'illustre le cliché ci-dessous pris à La Rosière en Savoie.

Bientôt le retour d'un temps plus calme ? Depuis plusieurs semaines, la France subit l’influence d’un courant océanique humide et perturbé, engendrant des précipitations fréquentes, des vents parfois tempétueux et un temps durablement instable. Jusqu'à présent, il était devenu rare d’enchaîner plusieurs jours de temps anticyclonique sur la France. Les hautes pressions ne parvenaient jamais à s’installer durablement, et le courant océanique reprenait rapidement le dessus. Cependant, une amélioration semble se profiler. Bien que le temps reste perturbé dans les prochains jours, les prévisions météorologiques annoncent le retour de conditions anticycloniques pour la fin de semaine sur la France et une partie de l’ouest de l’Europe. En effet, le courant-jet devrait circuler plus au nord de l’Europe en fin de semaine, permettant aux hautes pressions (anticyclone des Açores) de s’étendre à nouveau vers l’ouest du continent, et donc vers la France pour le week-end. Cela devrait assurer le retour d’un temps plus sec et calme durant au moins 4 jours. Prévision de l'évolution des anticyclones et dépressions sur l'Europe du jeudi 16 au lundi 23 février 2026 – Modèle européen via Meteociel Un temps calme s'imposant enfin plus durablement ? Il est difficile de prédire avec certitude. Si les modélisations de ces derniers jours suggéraient une tendance anticyclonique plus durable sur notre pays, les dernières simulations remettent en question cette hypothèse. Le courant océanique pourrait reprendre de la vigueur dès mercredi 25 février à la fin du mois. Prévision de l'évolution des anticyclones et dépressions sur l'Europe du lundi 23 février au lundi 2 mars 2026 – Modèle européen Cependant, certains scénarios envisagent une inversion de la situation et l'arrêt de ce courant perturbé océanique au début du mois de mars avec la formation d'un vaste anticyclone entre les Açores et la partie nord de l'Europe. Ceci annoncerait potentiellement le début d'une nouvelle accalmie beaucoup plus prolongée sur la France, mais il faudra attendre que la dépression qui viendra peut-être s'isoler sur le sud du pays disparaisse. Les tendances pour le mois de mars indiquent même un temps durablement sec. Bien que nous restions prudents, une telle évolution serait un contraste saisissant avec les conditions météorologiques récentes et une excellente nouvelle pour la gestion des crues et inondations. Si la majorité des modèles convergent vers cette prévision, il est essentiel de suivre l’évolution des prévisions dans les prochains jours, car les tendances peuvent changer à une échéance aussi lointaine.

Graves inondations dans le sud-ouest durant le mois de mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Le mois de mars 1930 est resté gravé dans les annales pour sa pluviométrie exceptionnelle dans le sud-ouest de la France, où des inondations d'ampleur historique avaient coûté la vie à plusieurs centaines de personnes ! Des crues d'ampleur dramatique Si les crues observées en ce mois de février 2026 sont majeures, celles survenues il y a un peu moins d'un siècle étaient encore plus spectaculaires. En effet, la fin de l'année 1929 se déroule sous un courant océanique persistant avec de nombreuses précipitations et cette tendance se poursuit au début de l'année 1930. Ainsi, les crues se multiplient sur le pays et atteignent leur apogée au mois de mars 1930, notamment dans les régions du sud-ouest. Les cours d'eau atteignent des niveaux records et les vastes plaines sont recouvertes par l'eau à perte de vue ! Ampleur remarquable des inondations dans le sud-ouest en mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Parmi les crues les plus remarquables, celle du Tarn marque véritablement les esprits. Du 1er au 4 mars 1930, le Tarn et ses affluents atteignent des niveaux et des débits historiques, se transformant en de véritables torrents ! Les communes traversées par ces cours d'eau subissent des crues d'ampleur exceptionnelle et la puissance du courant provoquer l'effondrement de nombreux bâtiments.

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Après l’épisode neigeux de dimanche (qui a finalement été moins important que prévu), la douceur est revenue rapidement. Cependant, de nouvelles chutes de neige pourraient se produire en limite de l’air froid mercredi matin. Un conflit avec l'air froid sur le nord de la France Dès mardi soir, de l’air froid en provenance de Scandinavie descendra vers l’Allemagne et la Belgique, et pourrait toucher toutes les régions situées au nord de la Seine. Dans cette zone, les températures seront négatives, tandis qu’au sud de la Loire, il fera facilement plus de 10°C. Les régions autour de la Seine seront donc au cœur d’un conflit avec des températures autour de 0 à 1°C et des précipitations causées par une dépression en Manche. Ces précipitations pourraient se transformer en neige, notamment en raison de l’isothermie engendrée par l’intensité et la persistance de ces dernières. Dans ce type de situation, tout est possible, car la formation de la neige dépend de la température et de l’intensité des précipitations. L'étendue et la localisation des chutes de neige régions dépendront également de la position de la dépression. Position des masses d'air à 850 hPa prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO européen pour mercredi matin - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Une zone de neige possible au niveau de la Seine ou au nord Depuis trois ou quatre jours, le modèle météo européen prévoit des chutes de neige au nord de la Seine, sur une bande d'environ 150 km de large. Ce secteur est souvent le théâtre de confrontations hivernales entre l’air froid scandinave et la douceur océanique, ce qui peut entraîner d’importantes chutes de neige. Les exemples ne manquent pas… Évolution des épaisseurs de neige prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO américain entre mercredi 00h et jeudi 7h - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Selon les cartes de prévision des épaisseurs de neige du modèle météo européen pour mercredi matin, il pourrait tomber entre 1 et 10 cm de neige dans cette zone. Cependant, cette carte pourrait exagérer les chutes de neige, comme ce fut le cas lors de l’épisode de dimanche matin. Ces prévisions dépendent évidemment du conflit, mais surtout des températures. Il est donc possible que seuls les plateaux situés à plus de 100 m d’altitude soient blanchis. Dans ce type de situation, les vallées connaissent généralement des températures trop élevées pour que la neige tienne réellement au sol. Épaisseurs de neige prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO européen pour mercredi matin - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Le modèle américain envisage de la neige un peu plus au nord Le modèle météo européen n’est pas le seul à prévoir de la neige ce mercredi matin. Le modèle américain, quant à lui, anticipe un conflit à peu près calé sur la même zone, mais avec des épaisseurs qui semblent plus réalistes. Soyons honnêtes, certains modèles ne prévoient aucune neige, car les températures seraient trop élevées pour sa formation. Dans ces situations « limites », les prévisions météo sont délicates, même à quelques heures d’échéance.

Après plusieurs journées aux allures de printemps, marquées par une douceur exceptionnelle — jusqu’à 18 °C à Paris le 18 février 1958 — la situation bascule brutalement. Une masse d’air polaire déferle par le nord et le thermomètre s’effondre de 12 °C en seulement quelques heures. Tout le Nord-Pas-de-Calais paralysé après une nuit de cauchemar Dans la nuit du 25 au 26 février 1958, une violente tempête de neige frappe toute la moitié nord de la France, et particulièrement le Nord-Pas-de-Calais. En quelques heures, 10 à 15 cm de neige tombent, balayés par des rafales proches de 120 km/h. D’immenses congères se forment, bloquant routes et autoroutes. Des centaines d’automobilistes se retrouvent piégés dans leur véhicule, incapables d’avancer ou de faire demi-tour. En pleine nuit, des milliers de voitures sont abandonnées en rase campagne. Le bilan est dramatique : quatre personnes perdent la vie. Robert Lamoureux, Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle pris dans la tempête de neige Parmi les conducteurs pris au piège figure le fantaisiste Robert Lamoureux. En route de Bruxelles vers Paris au volant de sa voiture américaine, il se heurte à un véritable mur de neige près de Baisieux. Alors qu’il tente de se dégager, son véhicule s’embrase. Il réussit à s’extraire à temps, échappant de justesse à la catastrophe. Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle vivent eux aussi une nuit éprouvante. Après s’être rendus à Lille pour présenter le film « Ascenseur pour l’échafaud », dont elle est la vedette et lui le réalisateur, ils prennent la direction de Thumeries, au sud de Lille, où réside la famille de Louis Malle. Leur voiture est immobilisée par la neige près de Seclin. Ils ne seront secourus que le lendemain matin, vers 8 heures, par un camionneur, transis de froid. La DS ensevelie par la neige et dans laquelle Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle ont été pris au piège durant une nuit, transis de froid - archives meteo-paris.com Cet épisode marque également un tournant médiatique. À la suite de cette tempête, Paul Douchy, prévisionniste à la Météorologie nationale, commence à présenter la météo quotidiennement à la télévision.

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Encore un peu de patience : cette longue séquence agitée et pluvieuse avec des inondations touche probablement à sa fin. Après une période transitoire d'environ une à deux semaines, il semble que le mois de mars sera beaucoup plus sec. Vers le retour d’un temps plus calme ? Depuis plusieurs semaines, la France est soumise à un flux océanique humide et perturbé. Résultat : des pluies fréquentes, des épisodes venteux parfois soutenus et une instabilité persistante. Les périodes anticycloniques durables se sont faites rares, les hautes pressions peinant à s’installer avant d’être rapidement balayées par le retour des perturbations atlantiques. Une évolution plus favorable semble toutefois se dessiner à moyen et long terme. A partir de ce week-end, les modèles météo envisagent le retour de conditions anticycloniques sur la moitié Sud de la France et le courant-jet remontera vers le nord du continent. Cette configuration apportera un temps plus sec et plus calme pendant au moins quatre jours, et surtout sur les régions de l'Ouest et du Sud-ouest, durement éprouvées par les inondations. Le grand retour de l'anticyclone des Açores sur le sud-ouest de l'Europe ce week-end ! Carte de prévisions ECMWF pour samedi 21 février 2026 Une accalmie durable en perspective ? La prudence reste néanmoins de mise. Si les simulations précédentes suggéraient une installation prolongée des hautes pressions, les dernières tendances sont plus nuancées. Le flux océanique pourrait se remettre en place dès le mercredi 25 février jusqu'en fin de mois. Certains scénarios envisagent cependant un changement plus marqué au début du mois de mars, avec l’établissement d’un vaste anticyclone entre les Açores et le nord de l’Europe. Une telle configuration pourrait bloquer durablement les perturbations atlantiques et favoriser une période sèche prolongée sur la France. Il resterait toutefois à surveiller l’éventuelle formation d’une dépression isolée sur le sud du pays, susceptible de retarder cette stabilisation. Les tendances mensuelles pour mars vont même dans le sens d’un temps globalement plus sec. Si cette évolution se confirmait, elle trancherait nettement avec les conditions agitées récentes et constituerait une bonne nouvelle pour la gestion des crues et des inondations. Néanmoins, à cette échéance, les projections restent susceptibles d’évoluer. Il conviendra donc de suivre attentivement les prochaines mises à jour des modèles météorologiques.

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Vague de froid du mois de février 1917 à Paris : Même les chevaux ne résistent pas ! archives meteo-paris.com Les deux derniers hivers de la Première Guerre mondiale sont particulièrement rudes en France, déjà en partie dévastée par trois années de combats. Entre le 20 janvier et le 15 février 1917, une vague de froid exceptionnelle frappe surtout le Nord et l’Est du pays, atteignant son apogée au début de février avec des températures extrêmement glaciales. Dans « Le Monde Illustré » du 3 février 1917, on note que cet hiver renoue avec la tradition, car selon le journal « les grands hivers d’antan deviennent de plus en plus rares… ». Il est vrai que la courbe de l’évolution des températures hivernales en France indique un réchauffement du début du siècle à l’arrivée de la Première Guerre mondiale. Des conditions météo insoutenables pour le moral des troupes Les sols gelés de l’Aisne, paradoxalement, permettent des mouvements de troupes impossibles sur sols boueux en temps normal. Cependant, l’armée française souffre terriblement du froid, étant nettement sous-équipée pour y résister, contrairement à l’armée allemande. Les régiments ne disposent que de quelques peaux de bête, et certains tirailleurs algériens sont même chaussés de souliers découverts et vêtus de culottes courtes. Ces conditions difficiles affectent grandement le moral des troupes. La relève sous la neige durant la guerre - début 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Jusqu’à -26°C dans les plaines et vallées de l'Est de la France ! Le froid atteint son point culminant au tout début du mois de février avec des températures glaciales : -26 °C à Bonneville, -23 °C à Commercy, -22 °C à Montbrison, -20 °C à Grenoble, -18 °C à Lyon, -17 °C à Alençon et Clermont-Ferrand, et -15,5 °C à Paris. Les dix premiers jours de février sont comparés à la situation de février 1895. A Paris, le déneigement des voies de circulation est très compliqué en raison du manque de main-d’œuvre. Les femmes sont alors réquisitionnées. Février 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Les rivières gèlent peu à peu Les rivières de l’Est commencent à geler le 24 janvier, tandis que celles du Nord, y compris celles de la région parisienne, le sont dans les derniers jours de janvier, un phénomène inédit depuis 1895. La navigation devient impossible sur les canaux puis sur la Seine. Parallèlement, la forte demande en charbon engendre d’importantes difficultés d’approvisionnement à Paris, comme à Londres. Malgré l’utilisation de quelques brise-glace et la construction de barrages pour retenir les glaces près de Rouen, les péniches restent bloquées entre Rouen et Paris. Un service spécial de transports automobiles est alors mis en place. Rouen - 7 février 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Le prix du charbon s'envole !! Les files d’attente pour acheter du charbon s’allongent, et les prix s’envolent. Même les bourgeoises des beaux quartiers doivent attendre des heures, ce qui ne manque pas de provoquer quelques grincements de dents, tant figurés que réels. La pénurie de charbon, alors que de nombreuses machines en dépendaient à l’époque, a de plus en plus d’impact sur l’activité économique. Des lignes de tramway sont interrompues, des usines ferment leurs portes, et les blanchisseries, chauffées au coke, cessent progressivement leurs activités. Certains journaux s’indignent même que les prisonniers allemands soient mieux chauffés que les Français. La rareté du charbon entraîne une flambée des prix du bois de chauffage dans les grandes villes. Il est alors vendu au kilo, après avoir été scié et pesé sur des balances à main. Par ailleurs, les fourrures en peau de lapin deviennent très bon marché.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware) RFID cards and tags are everywhere! We use them in buildings for access control. Printers and photocopiers can use them to identify staff members. Livestock tagging and pet identification tags all use a form of RFID. The tech to read an RFID device is cheap, for around $5 you can get the reader, and for $4, a Raspberry Pi Pico can read the IDs from the cards / tags.In this how to, we will learn how to read RFID tags and cards using an MFRC522 reader and a Raspberry Pi Pico, the goal will be to create a fictional RFID access control system that will allow users into a building, or alert security to remove them. Before we can do that, we need to identify the ID of our cards / tags. The first section of this how to will do just that, and then we will insert some code to control two LEDs to simulate the locking mechanism.For this how to you will needRaspberry Pi Pico running MicroPythonMFRC522 RFID readerLarge breadboard11 x Male to male jumper wiresGreen LEDRed LED2 x 100 Ohm resistors (Brown - Black - Brown - Gold)Building the Hardware (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The hardware build is split into two sections.

**Source:** IoT Business News | **Keyword:** `Business`
Key Insights (AI-assisted):
Tightening integration between intrinsically safe hardware and modern connectivity is shifting hazardous-area IoT from niche pilots to scalable deployments. As ATEX smartphones gain full cellular, GNSS, and sensor stacks, the bottleneck moves from device capability to interoperability with SCADA, MDM, and line-of-business applications. This forces OT and IT teams to converge architectures and security models, particularly on private LTE/5G. The trend reflects a broader move toward real-time, worker-centric IoT in brownfield industrial environments with stringent safety and regulatory constraints. Sensors, standards, and operational constraints in hazardous zones
A technician in a chemical plant needs to log temperature readings, check equipment vibration, and photograph a valve assembly. Standard procedure, but in a Zone 2 hazardous area, standard electronics won’t do. The risk isn’t the device itself – it’s what happens if a component fails and creates a spark, or if a surface gets hot enough to ignite surrounding gases.
Industrial IoT in petrochemical, mining, and pharmaceutical facilities comes down to collecting sensor data while ensuring equipment remains intrinsically safe.

### 2. `EN` [Apple’s budget MacBook coming soon: What to expect](data/articles/d95e9934296ec3d2ee791238f40014c0.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple’s MacBook lineup could be in for a major shakeup. The company is reportedly planning on releasing a new, low-cost laptop that can compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops in the budget market. Such a laptop could bring the Mac to a whole new class of users.
The new MacBook may feature an aluminum design in playful colors, an A19 Pro chip, Ultra Retina XDR OLED display, fewer ports, and Apple’s C2 modem. This new, low-cost MacBook could be a very popular one, which means you’ll want to keep track of its developments. Well, look no further. This article will keep track of the rumors and reports of this upcoming product, as well as offer our perspective on the device, so keep an eye on this page for the latest. New A19 MacBook: Release date
March 4, 2026 – possible Apple is scheduled to host three “Apple Special Experiences” on March 4 in the U.S., U.K., and China. These sessions, which are expected to offer media hands-on time with new products, could provide the ideal setting for the budget MacBook’s debut.
Apple’s low-cost MacBook has been rumored for some time, with Apple leaker Jon Prosser describing a new colorful MacBook Air back in May 2021, that never materialised, but over the past year rumors have remerged suggesting that Apple does have something different coming. In June 2025, credible analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, indicated (in Chinese) that Apple would start production of the new low-cost MacBook at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025 or in the early stage of the first quarter of 2026. It’s worth emphasising that those dates refer to the manufacturing process rather than the announcement or shipping timeframe. If production began in October 2025 then it’s plausible that the budget MacBook will arrive in early 2026, potentially unveiled at a spring event, or in the run up to Apple’s March 4 ‘Experience’. In November, 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning to release a “low-cost laptop to rival Chromebooks and Windows PCs” in the first half of 2026. He said it was currently in testing at Apple and “in early production with overseas suppliers.”
On February 8, 2026, Gurman reported that the low-cost MacBook will be available “in the first half of the year.” He did not offer any specifics. And then, on February 15, he wrote that Apple’s long-rumored low-cost MacBook is expected to arrive “as early as March,” with a design that defies its price tag. What will the new MacBook be called? MacBook (probably)
No reports have been made about the official name of the laptop, but you can assume it won’t be part of the MacBook Air line. It’s being referred to as the A18 or A19 Pro MacBook, based on the chip it could have. Apple could simply call it “MacBook,” reviving the name of the discontinued 12-inch MacBook that was targeted at a similar market. Apple last updated the MacBook in 2017.
Foundry New A19 MacBook: Design
Playful colors
Aluminum chassis (not plastic) According to Mark Gurman (in February 2026), Apple’s low-cost MacBook will have a design that defies its price tag. Apple’s goal with this laptop is to make it affordable compared to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, and one way to cut costs is to make a plastic case instead of an aluminum one. However, since Apple is working to make its products carbon-neutral, it’s doubtful that it would use plastic, preferring to use aluminum or some other recyclable or carbon-free material. Therefore, it is no surprise that the new MacBook, according to Gurman, will have an aluminum chassis. There will be a new manufacturing process “designed to be both faster and more cost-effective than the one used with Apple’s current laptops,” according to Gurman. Along with the aluminum shell, Gurman reports that the new MacBook will be available in “playful colors.”
The following colours are indicated: yellow, light green, blue, silver, dark gray, and pink. Which, in the case of yellow, green and blue, does seem to match the logo Apple designed for the invites to the special events on March 4. Apple Back in June 2023 analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested the following colors: silver, blue, pink, and yellow. A19 Pro MacBook: Display
12.9-inch display – rumored
Apple currently uses a Liquid Retina (LED-backlit display with IPS technology) display in the MacBook Air, an upgrade over the original Retina displays Apple last used with the 13-inch MacBook Pro in 2022. It’s possible Apple could revert to a Retina display with squared-off corners for the A19 Pro MacBook, though it’s more likely that Apple shaves cost by using a smaller display.
On August 11, DigiTimes reported that the laptop will have a 12.9-inch display, slightly smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air. New A19 MacBook: Processor
iPhone chip: A19 Pro or A18 Pro – expected
Another way to meet the pricing goals for this new MacBook is to use a chip that isn’t as robust as the chips used in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. When Kuo first discussed the budget MacBook in his June 2025 report, he stated that Apple will use an A18 Pro, the same chip that was in the iPhone 16 Pro. Now that the A19 arrived with the iPhone 17 this is probably the more likely chip. about what the iPhone 17 can tell us about the MacBook that could use the same chip in: Is Apple’s rumored cheap MacBook hiding in plain sight? The A-series chips are used in iPhones, while M-series chips are in Macs. Both chip families are based on the same general architecture, but the M chips generally offer more processing power.
An A19 Pro (and A18 Pro) can technically do everything an M-series chip can, but it will be slower. When comparing Geekbench 6 benchmarks, the A18 Pro offered single-core performance that’s on par with the M3. However, because the A18 Pro has only 6 CPU cores, its multi-core performance is slightly behind the M1, which has 8 CPU cores. If Apple keeps everything the same, an A18 Pro MacBook will perform like an M1 MacBook Air, which, for a lot of people, has more than enough processing power. Should Apple use an A19 Pro we can expect something even better. It will draw comparison with the iPad models that are powered by Mac chips, though. MacRumors reported, in December 2025, that references to an A18 Pro MacBook appeared in a set of leaked Apple files.
New A19 MacBook: Connectivity
Apple is using its own wireless networking chip, the N1 in the iPhone 17, bringing Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 7, and Thread. It’s likely the same chips will make their way into the A19 Pro MacBook. There’s also a chance this new Mac will have cellular connectivity using Apple’s C1, C1X or yet to launch C2 modem. The C2 is likely to support mmWave. Aside from this, it’s rumored that the budget MacBook will have fewer USB ports than the MacBook Air (which has two USB-C and a magsafe charging port). This low-cost MacBook may not support Thunderbolt. New A19 MacBook: Camera
No camera?
It’s also possible that Apple opts not to include a built-in camera. Over the past several years, Apple has promoted the Mac’s Continuity Camera feature that lets you use an iPhone as a Mac webcam, as well as the upcoming macOS Tahoe Magnifier app. Apple could promote this as a webcam solution. This would be a drastic change, since it’s been a long time since Apple shipped a laptop without a camera, but it could be a possibility in order to meet the company’s price goal. New A19 MacBook: Performance Results are expressed as Geekbench scores. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. We don’t yet have the benchmarks for the A19 Pro, but the A18 Pro has 8GB of RAM, which Apple has said is the bare minimum required to run Apple Intelligence features. So, this new laptop will have at least 8GB of RAM and possibly 16GB, like the other MacBook models. Since the iPhone doesn’t offer RAM upgrades, we don’t know what Apple could charge for extra memory.
As for graphics performance, the A18 Pro has a 6-core GPU, and its Metal score in Geekbench 6’s Compute benchmark is similar to that of the M1 found in the MacBook Air. It’s not a cutting-edge performer, but it’ll handle everyday tasks without any issues. Since Apple’s other MacBooks all start at 256GB of storage, it’s nearly certain this model will come with 256GB of storage as well. New A19 MacBook: Price
The cheapest laptop Apple sells is the $999 MacBook Air. However, Walmart still sells the M1 MacBook Air with a 256GB SSD for $649 and as low as $599. The A19 Pro MacBook has been thought of as a replacement for this Walmart model, though it’s hard to believe it would be that cheap. A price that falls between $729 and $849 seems like it would fit into the MacBook lineup.
There are claims that the low-cost MacBook could start at $599, which could allow Apple to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops. Gurman reports that the new laptop will cost “well under $1,000.”
Our estimation would be around the middle of those two figures, around $749. @macworld.com A cheap MacBook…or something else. A rumor says that Apple is going to release a cheap laptop, but what if it’s actually the long-rumored iPad/Mac hybrid we’ve heard about?

### 3. `EN` [M1 MacBook Air Out of Stock at Walmart as Lower-Cost MacBook Nears](data/articles/f8e2c7036676364c394861e8753689ed.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple's older MacBook Air with the M1 chip is now out of stock on Walmart's website in the U.S., amid rumors of a new lower-cost MacBook coming soon. A colorful MacBook (concept) Walmart first began selling the MacBook Air with the M1 chip for $699 in March 2024. The price later dropped to $649, then to $599, and briefly to as low as $549 during a Black Friday sale last year. However, we just noticed that it has been out of stock for a while now, and there is no indication if it will ever be returning. Apple first released the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020, as one of the first Macs with an Apple silicon chip, instead of an Intel processor. The configuration being sold by Walmart for as low as $549 included 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. They were new-in-box units, not refurbished or open-box models. Walmart's website continues to offer refurbished units from "trusted sellers" for as low as $449. discontinued the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in 2024, after it launched models with the M3 chip, and it has since updated the MacBook Air with the M4 chip. Prior to being discontinued, the model with the M1 chip was being sold for a starting price of $999 brand new, but Amazon sometimes offered it on sale for $749 to $899. The laptop going out of stock at Walmart could be a hint. plans to release a lower-priced MacBook with a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip as early as the first week of March, according to several reports and leakers. This would be an all-new model positioned below the MacBook Air in the Mac lineup, and it would mark a revival of the "MacBook" brand (with no "Air" or "Pro" designation). green, blue, pink, and/or yellow. A few rumors have specifically said it will have a 12.9-inch screen. discontinued 12-inch MacBook, including an ultra-thin and lightweight design. However, that model was powered by Intel processors. Apple stopped selling the 12-inch MacBook in July 2019, so there has been a long wait for a similar model powered by Apple silicon. In the iPhone 16 Pro, the A18 Pro chip has a 6-core CPU and a 6-core GPU. The chip's multi-core performance is similar to the M1 chip, so this new MacBook could effectively be a replacement for the MacBook Air with the M1 chip, and that could explain why it is finally out of stock at Walmart ahead of the lower-cost MacBook launching. Skyrocketing DRAM and NAND storage chip prices may have been a factor too, though. Related Roundup: MacBook Air

### 5. `EN` [No, Apple won’t drop USB-C from the iPhone 18](data/articles/35940d125bc3496954dcdb09c3e96172.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Most iPhone fans are currently focused on the imminent launch of the iPhone 17e, which could be here in a matter of days. But one dubious rumor doing the rounds on social media right now concerns a flagship phone from the next generation. It’s just a shame that it’s almost certainly wrong.
This TikTok video, which at the time of writing has been viewed more than 17 million times, purports to show the charging port of the iPhone 18. (Or “iPhone18,” as it’s labelled by the clearly knowledgeable maker.) But rather than the USB-C port, which has been used on all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 15 in 2023, the animation shows something more akin to the MagSafe connector that appears on newer MacBooks. This video might look cool, but it’s not going to happen. TikTok The charging cable, which has a rather nice black braided cord, attaches via a magnetic connection. When it’s in place a green LED lights up on the charger head, and a small green lightning bolt is shown at the bottom of the previously blank phone screen. (Never mind that iPhones don’t behave like this; it’s the least of our worries.) It looks very similar to the MagSafe cable on my 2021 MacBook Pro, except with three pins instead of five and a chunkier body.
Now, the video doesn’t list its sources; we don’t get the usual “supply-chain sources” or “people with knowledge of the matter.” It’s just an animation. So in some ways it’s quite difficult to refute: where did this information come from? Who said this was likely? Is this simply a concept that an illustrator dreamed up, like this animation from the same channel showing possible iPhone 18 Pro colors?
Whatever the video’s intention, it’s getting major traction from viewers who think it’s real. A quick browse through a handful of the 9,700-odd reveals viewer after viewer complaining about Apple’s foolishness in doing this, or the impracticality of the design. A few appear to be Android fans mocking iPhone users for their misfortune. I couldn’t find any pointing out that this is extraordinarily unlikely to happen.
Because, as several commenters argue, it wouldn’t be a practical solution. It would disconnect very easily, and unlike on the MacBook, disconnecting easily isn’t necessary to protect it from a specific type of accident. It would annoy customers and accessories makers. And it could create problems with the EU, who mandated USB-C connectors on all smartphones sold in its territory.
What may have happened is that someone has got confused between MagSafe on the iPhone and MagSafe on the Mac. They’re both charging standards that use a magnetic connection to keep the charging points in place, but in most other respects they’re totally different. (For example, the phone’s magnetic connection is stronger so that it remains connected if you nudge the device, whereas the laptop is designed to detach if you trip on the wire.) The iPhone 17 already has the phone version of MagSafe, and the iPhone 18 will too, but that doesn’t mean it will have the Mac version as well. If nothing else, it would be enormously confusing.
Whereas the iPhone 17e is expected to be here in time for Apple’s “experience” on March 4, the first 18-series iPhones won’t arrive until September. And the actual iPhone 18, the cheaper baseline model, might not turn up until the following spring. So bookmark our iPhone 18 superguide to keep up with all the latest news and rumors.

### 8. `EN` [Apple Watch: 15 Tips Every Owner Needs to Know](data/articles/f9893fd9ed2b294e46101c866f494fc7.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple Watch is now eleven generations in, and packed with useful features that are easy to miss at first glance. To help you get more out of your new device, we've rounded up 15 practical tips you might not have discovered yet, including a few that long-time users often overlook. Bounce Between Two Apps On your Apple Watch, double-press the Digital Crown to see a deck of all currently open apps, and turn it to scroll through them. From this view, you can jump back to the last app you were using. Simply tap on an app screen to switch to it, or swipe left on its card and tap the red X button to quit it. Switch App Views If the app grid feels messy, switch to List View. Open the Watch app on iPhone, tap App View, and choose List View. From then on, pressing the Digital Crown will show your apps in a simple, scrollable list. Rearrange Apps You can rearrange your apps so that the ones you use most are closer to hand. Simply press and hold on any app in the grid view, then drag it where you want. Alternatively, open the Watch app on your iPhone, go to App View ➝ Arrangement, and move things around there instead. Ping Your iPhone If you've misplaced your iPhone but you're sure it's nearby, open Control Center with a press of the Side button, then tap the phone icon to make it ping. Press and hold that icon and the iPhone's camera flash will blink too, which can help if it's hidden under something. Skip the Countdown If you're eager to start a workout, the three-second countdown before it starts can be skipped. Just tap the screen when the countdown begins and your workout will start immediately. If you find yourself doing this regularly, consider turning on Precision Start in Settings ➝ Workout. Customize Vibration Strength If you keep missing notifications, go to Settings ➝ Sounds &amp; Haptics ➝ and change from Default to Prominent. This adds an extra tap pattern before alerts so they're harder to ignore. Perform Precision Timing The Chronograph Pro watch face transforms into an actual chronograph. Tap the outer edge surrounding the main 12-hour dial on this watch face to record time on scales of 60, 30, 6, or 3 seconds. Alternatively, select the tachymeter timescale to measure speed based on time travel over a fixed distance. Jump to the Top If you've scrolled way down in an app and want to jump back to the top, just tap the time in the top corner of the screen. It works in most apps and saves a lot of scrolling. Remove Apps Clearing out apps you don't use on your Apple Watch is easy. In the List or Grid View, press and hold on the screen until the apps jiggle, then tap the small x in the corner of the app icon to delete it. This works for most system apps and all third-party apps. Customize Control Center By default, Control Center (accessed via the Side button) gives you quick access to things like Wi-Fi, battery, and Do Not Disturb. But it's worth seeing what else you can add to it that you'd like quick access to. Tap the Edit button at the bottom, then tap the + icon in the top-left corner of the screen. System options such as New Note and Lights are particularly handy, and you might see some third-party options listed too, depending on your installed apps. Speak the Time Out Loud If you're using the Mickey or Minnie watch face, tap on the character and they'll speak the time out loud. Just make sure your sound is turned on. In fact, you can also have Siri read the time on any watch face by tapping and holding with two fingers on the display. Again though, sound needs to be enabled. Customize Smart Replies Smart Replies are handy when you want to reply with just a few words. In the Watch app on iPhone, go to Messages and tap Default Replies to customise what shows up. Then when a message comes in, simply swipe down to pick one of your preset replies. Pause Activity Rings Feeling unwell but hoping to keep your streak intact? In the Activity app, select your rings to access the option to suspend them for the day, or set a pause that lasts until a chosen date up to 90 days ahead. Create a Note In the new Notes app in watchOS 26, you can't modify existing notes on Apple Watch, but you can create a new one by tapping the compose control in the bottom-right corner and speaking your text. Because Notes sync through iCloud, you can refine or reorganize everything later on a device with a physical or on-screen keyboard.

### 9. `EN` [Apple's C1X Modem Faces First Reported Failure in iPhone Air](data/articles/a6f77cdad23f940cd3064110cdb2318e.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
A reported hardware failure affecting Apple's new in-house C1X 5G modem in the iPhone Air has surfaced online, marking the first known real-world incident involving the company's own baseband technology. The ‌iPhone Air‌ is the first iPhone model to ship with the Apple's internally designed C1X 5G modem, replacing Qualcomm's X75 modem used across the iPhone 16 lineup. The transition to Apple-designed modems follows years of development after Apple acquired Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019 and began building its own baseband engineering teams and intellectual property portfolio with the goal of reducing reliance on Qualcomm and increasing efficiency. support thread on Reddit spotted by Wccftech, where the user "itstheskylion" described waking up to find the device had completely lost cellular reception. According to the user, the phone displayed no signal bars and diagnostics indicated a hardware-level cellular problem. The device had reportedly been kept in a case since purchase and showed no signs of physical damage. The user said that multiple troubleshooting steps were attempted, including restarting the device, performing a soft reset, and resetting network settings, but none restored cellular connectivity. The user also reported using a dual-SIM configuration with two different carriers, with neither connection functioning, which suggests the issue was not related to a carrier outage or network-specific disruption. Baseband hardware failures are uncommon in modern smartphones due to extensive factory testing and validation processes, but large-scale production inevitably includes a small percentage of defective units. Apple has historically replaced and collected devices that exhibit unusual behavior for internal analysis, particularly when new technologies are involved. At present, there is no evidence that the issue is widespread or indicative of a broader reliability concern. iPhone 18 Pro, ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max, and foldable ‌iPhone‌ are rumored to feature Apple's next-generation C2 modem.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple launched a new series of iPhones at the end of 2025: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, as well as a brand new iPhone Air, but there was no new iPhone 17e for those hoping for an update to the budget iPhone.
This wasn’t a surprise: Apple released the iPhone 16e in February 2025 to replace the iPhone SE, so an update to the iPhone “e” series phones wasn’t expected to arrive until early 2026.
If you’re considering buying an iPhone 17e, this is the place to keep up to date on its development. We’ll keep track of the latest reports and provide our analysis to help you decide if the iPhone 17e is the right phone for you.
What’s new since the last update to this article: It’s a year since the iPhone 16e launch on February 19 2025, will the iPhone 17e arrive today? Probably not, but it’s likely to arrive before, or on, March 4. At a glance: iPhone 17e vs iPhone 16e Specification / FeatureiPhone 16eiPhone 17e Launch / ReleaseFebruary 2025March 4 (Possible)

March 4 launch – possible The iPhone 16e arrived on February 19, 2025, so there was some hope that Apple could introduce its replacement on February 19 a year later… With that date now here it’s looking unlikely. However, there is an “Apple Special Experience” coming up on March 4, 2026, with media being invited to meet Apple execs in at least three global locations. It’s generally thought these meetings will tie to new Apple product launches. There are a number of other new product launches expected including a refreshed iPad Air, new entry-level iPad, M5 MacBook Air, M5 Pro/MaxMacBook Pro, and a brand new low cost MacBook.
An event on March 4 – even if Apple isn’t referring to it as an event – is good timing for Apple to launch the new iPhone 17e because it is right in the middle of the Mobile World Congress. According to various reports, the iPhone 17e has entered test production runs to prepare it for a spring 2026 release.
A rumor in early January said the iPhone 17e will go into production following CES (which ended January 9). This is unsurprising, as it follows the same pattern as the iPhone 16e. iPhone 17e: Specs: What’s new for the iPhone 17e
A19 with one fewer GPU than iPhone 17 – likely
MagSafe support – likely
C1X modem – possible
256GB SSD – possible
Apple’s decision to introduce the iPhone 16e in February 2025 represented a significant shift in its product strategy, moving away from the sporadic release cycle of the iPhone SE toward a more predictable, annual “e-series” lineup. This transition was driven by several strategic imperatives, ranging from the necessity of supporting new AI technologies to the desire to test in-house hardware components in a lower-risk environment. To maintain a starting price of $599 while including the high-end A18 chip, Apple made several calculated omissions that differentiate the 16e from the standard iPhone 16. The iPhone 17e is expected to address some of the shortcomings of the iPhone 16e with a few key design refinements (a Dynamic Island is rumored), more storage at the entry-level, MagSafe support and an updated processor (the A19).
Processor: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and others have reported that the iPhone 17e will have an A19 chip, which is no real surprise. If this is the case, it may be a slightly less powerful than the A19 chip used by the iPhone 17. Apple uses binned chips in the “e” series, so Tte A18 in the iPhone 16e has one fewer GPU core than the A18 in the standard iPhone 16; and the A19 in the iPhone 17e will likely have one fewer GPU core than the iPhone 17.
MagSafe: A December 2025 report in The Information claimed that Apple will add MagSafe support to the iPhone 17e, one of the features that is notably missing from the 16e. When we reviewed the 16e, the lack of MagSafe was one of its major shortcomings. A Macworld source in February 2026 claimed that the iPhone 17e will feature 25W MagSafe wireless charging.
Modem: Apple’s C1 modem first appeared in the iPhone 16e, and rumors suggest the iPhone 17e will use the same modem. However, it could take the newer C1X modem as found in the iPhone 17 series, which is apparently two times faster than the C1 while using 30% less energy.
Storage: There are suggestions that the iPhone 17e could follow the iPhone 17 with 256GB at the starting point, up from 128GB. However, in February 2026 Apple leaker, John Prosser said he expects the baseline storage to stay at 128GB. iPhone 17e: How the iPhone 17e display will be different
Dynamic Island instead of notch – possible Notch vs Dynamic Island.
David Price / Foundry Screen size: The iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch screen, which is larger than that of the iPhone 16 (6.1-inch). The iPhone 17e is not expected to get a bigger screen. It will likely sport a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate, the same as the iPhone 16e. Dynamic Island: Digital Chat Station reported in August 2025 that the display will have a Dynamic Island – a change from the notch on the iPhone 16e.
OLED: In December 2025, Korean website, The Elec reported that BOE will provide OLED displays to Apple for the iPhone 17e. BOE also provided OLEDs for the iPhone 16e. Samsung Display and LG Display are expected to also provide 17e displays. Bezels: The display, according to The Elec, will have thinner bezels than the 16e. iPhone 17e: Cameras
18MP front camera with square sensor – likely
The iPhone 17e will likely continue to have a single 48MP camera on the back but the 12MP camera on the front (as seen on the iPhone 16e) could get an update in line with the iPhone 17 series). The front-facing cameras across the iPhone 17 range have all been updated to 18MP, so it is possible that the iPhone 17e will see the same update to the selfie camera. If so, it will also include a square sensor capable of taking photos in any orientation without requiring the user to rotate the phone. The notch may be replaced by the Dynamic Island in the iPhone 17e. Foundry | Alex Walker-Todd iPhone 17e: Design &amp; Colors
Digital Island likely to be only visible external change
Colors: There have been no reports relating to the iPhone 17e’s colors. The iPhone 16e is available in black or white, and we expect the same for the iPhone 17e.
Design: No changes are expected for the design, although, as mentioned above, the new iPhone 17e could have a Digital Island instead of the notch at the top of the screen. There is a possibility that the there could be thinner bezels than the 16e, according to The Elec. iPhone 17e: Price
Starting at $599
A January 2026 report on Wccftech suggests that Apple has been able to reduce costs for the new iPhone 17e, so that the price won’t increase. This is thanks to lower costs for the OLED panels Apple is using. The iPhone 16e starts at $599/£599, and Apple is expected to price the iPhone 17e at $599 as well, though no reports have been made so far. Tariffs and production cost increases may affect the price, but since the “e” series is considered Apple’s lowest-priced iPhone, the price would not exceed that of the iPhone 17, which starts at $799, and the iPhone 16, whose price has been reduced to start at $699.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Meta is set to release its first smartwatch this year featuring health-tracking and built-in Meta AI, reports The Information. The smartwatch, which would compete directly with Apple Watch and other brands, is the result of a revived project that Meta canceled in 2022 amid broader spending cuts at its Reality Labs hardware division. The original project involved plans to release three different camera-equipped watch models, but it doesn't sound like they will be part of the company's future product lineup. The new watch is code-named "Malibu 2." include facial recognition – and it sounds like they will almost definitely appear before a pair of mixed reality glasses that the company has also been developing. Internally code-named "Phoenix," the MR glasses are said to have been delayed until 2027. Meta executives are said to have grown concerned that launching too many devices in quick succession could confuse customers, hence the delay. Last year, the Facebook parent company launched its Ray-Ban Display AR glasses, which apparently proved so popular that Meta had to delay an international rollout. Those glasses use a neural wristband for its gestural interface, so it's possible the new smartwatch could potentially take over those controls. Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is developing rival smart glasses, an AI pin, and AirPods with cameras, all of which will connect to the iPhone and will interface with the smarter version of Siri that's in the works.

### 12. `EN` [ChatGPT is your iPhone’s secret superpower](data/articles/741a4c823aae478a599df55d9f9db481.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld AI is rapidly being integrated into the hardware and services we depend on, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs. While Apple’s in-house AI models remain relatively limited for now, Apple users have other options: most appealingly, the company has natively baked OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT into its systems. This enables you to easily fetch up-to-date information, polish text, generate images, and much more.
If you’re not already using AI to accelerate your everyday workflows, it’s time to get with the program. Try these 10 ChatGPT features on your Apple devices of choice, and watch your productivity skyrocket.
Applets
OpenAI recently launched ChatGPT apps as a way to access your favorite services using text prompts. The feature is available in the latest ChatGPT app across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and the web. To get started, you can visit the Apps section in ChatGPT settings and connect the accounts you’re interested in.
For example, the Apple Music applet lets you find songs, generate playlists, and add them to your library right from ChatGPT. Similarly, the Adobe Acrobat offering enables you to upload a PDF document and make certain tweaks using the chatbot’s interface.
As you’d probably expect, the functionality of these apps is somewhat limited. They’re cut-down versions of the full app, a little like Apple’s App Clips, and more advanced workflows will still require the use of the real thing. But they’re solid for performing specific, quick tasks using natural language. There wasn’t much AI in the 90s, but we made up for it with our indie music. Mahmoud Itani / Foundry macOS assistance
ChatGPT’s integration with apps isn’t confined to the limited range of applets available on the platform itself. If you’ve installed the official client on your Mac, you’ll be able to link it to active macOS app sessions and ask relevant questions.
Simply tap on the App Store icon in the ChatGPT app’s text box to view a list of compatible, installed apps. If you pick Terminal, for instance, it will read the commands you’re entering and help you type the correct ones to achieve a certain aim. Likewise, it can view the notes you’re typing and suggest edits based on your prompt.
Quick access
Locate the ChatGPT app on your Home Screen can be inefficient when performing time-sensitive tasks. Fortunately, ChatGPT offers a ton of shortcuts to quickly summon it on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
On iOS and iPadOS, you can add ChatGPT controls to the Control Center and Lock Screen, letting you quickly initiate a new session from different parts of the system; on newer iPhones, you can also have the Action button launch a ChatGPT instance. On the Mac, you can hit Option and Space to reveal a miniature ChatGPT text box to enter your prompts, connect apps, upload files, and so on. You can also add ChatGPT to shortcuts you create in the Apple Shortcuts app and have it analyze input or fetch requested data.
Siri fallback
Siri often fails to answer basic questions and instead redirects users to web results. If you’ve enabled Apple Intelligence, however, the voice assistant can now tap into ChatGPT’s intellect instead. To turn this on, open the Settings app, go to Apple Intelligence and Siri &gt; ChatGPT, and enable the Use ChatGPT toggle. (You can also turn off the Confirm Requests option if you’d rather not have Siri ask for your permission every time it needs to share a text prompt with ChatGPT’s servers.) Now, you can command Siri to ask ChatGPT any question, and it’ll read aloud the response it receives.
Writing Tools
This neat text editing suite allows you to natively proofread, rewrite, summarize, and change the tone of selected text. Thanks to ChatGPT, the feature also lets you apply custom edits or generate text from scratch. Just select the text you’d like to edit, then hit Writing Tools, followed by Compose. You can then describe the changes you’d like to make and ChatGPT will handle the rest. ChatGPT offers a range of preset styles when generating images.
Mahmoud Itani / Foundry Image Playground
Image Playground is Apple’s own AI image generator, featuring multiple illustration styles, doodle polishing support, offline access, and more. To elevate the quality of outputted images, you can rely on ChatGPT’s superior image generation models without leaving the app. Click the Styles dropdown menu in the Playground app on iOS, iPadOS, or macOS, then select ChatGPT. You can then pick a more specific style, such as Anime, Vector, or Oil Painting. Now you can type your prompt or add some of the suggested ones and wait for the result to appear.
Paid perks and data sync
Using ChatGPT integration on your Apple devices comes with daily limits that, when exceeded, prevent you from uploading files, generating images, and accessing advanced models. If you’re subscribed to ChatGPT Go, Plus, or Pro, you can link your paid account to extend or remove said limits. In Settings, go to Apple Intelligence &amp; Siri &gt; ChatGPT, and sign in with your OpenAI account. This will also sync the conversations you have with ChatGPT via Siri and show them in your chat history.
Group chats
Lastly, if you’re planning an event or working on a project with others, you can create a group chat in the ChatGPT app. To get started, tap on the dedicated button in the top-right corner of a ChatGPT conversation and share the link with your friends or coworkers. This lets you all brainstorm together and have ChatGPT share its knowledge whenever needed. ChatGPT can contribute to group chats.
Mahmoud Itani / Foundry Shopping advice
Picking the right model when upgrading your Apple device can be confusing for tech newbies. Obviously, Macworld should be your first stop when seeking iPhone, iPad, or Mac buying advice, but ChatGPT is keen to join the party with its Shopping Research feature.
Select the relevant mode in the ChatGPT app and describe the product you’re looking to buy. ChatGPT will ask follow-up questions related to budget and performance expectations to narrow down your options, then display results comparing the prices, specs, images, and other relevant aspects of the matching devices. You can then choose one of them and buy it through your favorite online retailer.
Understanding your iDevices
ChatGPT can also help tech newbies learn more about their Apple devices and the latest OS features. Again, Macworld has long been happy to help in this regard, but who are we to stand in the way of progress? It’s far better, clearly, to ask a chatbot.
ChatGPT can, for example, check the latest available OS version for your device and briefly list the top features it introduces using simple language. This helps you familiarize yourself with what’s new, without having to read complex changelogs. Similarly, if you encounter errors when using your Apple devices, you can upload screenshots to ChatGPT or use the video calling mode to show it what’s going on in real time. The chatbot will then suggest solutions or workarounds based on similar issues discussed on online forums. Or beloved Apple-focused websites.

Macworld According to rumors, 2026 is shaping up to be a huge year for the Mac, starting in just a couple of weeks with Apple’s first event (or “experience”) of the year. Along with the usual faster chips, Apple reportedly has new tricks up its sleeve in 2026, with several new features that will have Mac users everywhere saying, “Finally!” Here are four major overdue announcements we expect to arrive this year.
A budget MacBook
iPhone fans have long pined for a truly affordable MacBook priced below the $999 MacBook Air that isn’t just an older model with a cut-rate price. That dream machine may finally arrive in just two short weeks. On March 4, Apple will hold a series of “experiences” in New York, London, and Shanghai, and the star is expected to be the first-ever low-cost MacBook. After tackling the mid-range market with the MacBook Air, Apple reportedly wants to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops, with a new laptop that could be as cheap as $599. Apple will reportedly use an A18 Pro or A19 Pro iPhone chip, and it will likely have a smaller screen than the Air and possibly fewer USB ports. But it will be powerful enough for everyday tasks and light work. For a lot of users, that’s all that’s needed.
MacBooks with OLED displays

### 14. `EN` [Could Apple Demo Immersive F1 on Vision Pro at Its March 4 Event?](data/articles/b15eaab55da86f0c3ee9fb5d11f5e314.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple's upcoming March 4 media event could include a demo of immersive Formula 1 content on Apple Vision Pro, Daring Fireball's John Gruber has suggested. The timing appears to be what's sparked the idea. The 2026 F1 season kicks off in Australia on March 8, just four days after the "Apple Experience" set to be held in New York, London, and Shanghai. last October, and the company has already been experimenting with live immersive sports on Vision Pro with a limited slate of Los Angeles Lakers games this season. If Apple has plans to stream F1 races live on Vision Pro with some level of immersion, March 4 would likely be a great opportunity to show it off to the press. To be clear, there are no little birdies tweeting into Gruber's ear on this one – he's quick to acknowledge this is pure speculation shared with him by a reader. "Could just be a total coincidence that the Formula 1 season is starting the weekend after this event," he says. "But it seems worth noting." Apple has said that further details on production and "new ways to enjoy F1 content" across its products will be shared in the coming months. March 4 could fit that timeline nicely, or it could of course be nothing at all. Apple is widely expected to unveil several new products in the near future, including the iPhone 17e, MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, an eighth-generation iPad Air, and a 12th-generation iPad. A refreshed Studio Display and an all-new low-cost MacBook powered by the A18 chip are also possible, alongside updates to the Apple TV and HomePod mini. Tag: John Gruber

iPhone Gift Guide: Cases
If your loved one doesn’t own a case for their iPhone then this may be the best gift you can get them as it will share a bit of personality while protecting their precious phone from knocks, drops, and everyday scrapes. If they already have a case, then buy them a new or better one. Just slipping on a new case can transform an old iPhone into something that feels brand new again. It’s even more satisfying than an iOS update!

iPhone Gift Guide: iPhone power banks
Hands up if your iPhone has never run out of juice during the day when you are far from a convenient power socket. Yeah, right.
Apple used to make a special Smart Battery Case for the iPhone but stopped selling these when it added MagSafe magnetic wireless charging to the iPhone 12 and later. It then sold its own MagSafe Battery Case but stopped making these when it launched the iPhone 15. But fear not, as there are some great MagSafe power banks out there that clamp onto the back of your iPhone (12/13/14/15/16/17) and can recharge the phone for long enough that you can reach a power source.
Of course, Macworld has tested many of them and picked the best MagSafe power banks, but here are a few of our favorites. Pros
Huge 10000mAh battery capacity
Built-in USB-C cable
Wireless or 30W wired charging Retailer Price View Deal Product Price The Anker Zolo Magnetic Power Bank is available in four colors—black, blue, pink or white—and uses MagSafe to magnetically stick to the back of your iPhone when you need a power boost. In our tests, it recharged an iPhone twice over with its 10000mAh battery capacity. Better still, it features its own built-in USB-C cable for charging up the battery pack or wired-charging the iPhone 15/16/17 families that have a USB-C port rather than Lightning. Using the cable rather than MagSafe will charge an iPhone 15/16/17 at an impressive 30W. MagSafe wireless charging is slower at 7.5W but it will still rescue a fading iPhone 12 or later—or you can supply your own Lightning cable (or USB-C for iPhone 15 users) and connect with a wire. It also features a handy kickstand. Anker If you have an older (pre-15) iPhone, then you need a Lightning cable but the non-magnetic Anker Zolo Power Bank has both, meaning it will still be relevant when you upgrade to a USB-C iPhone. And of course you can use the USB-C cable to charge the power bank itself. If you have a family with both USB-C (15/16/17) and Lightning (14 and earlier) iPhones this will suit all models. There’s a handy digital battery-level display, too. This version of the Zolo doesn’t feature wireless charging. Anker With no built-in cable but a fast 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging pad, a third option is the Anker MagGo 10K Slim Power Bank (above), which is the slimmest 10K high-capacity wireless power bank we have tested—perfect for carrying with you in a bag for emergencies when your iPhone starts to fade and you are miles from a power socket or have forgotten your charger and cable. Pros
5000mAh battery capacity
Color options
15W wireless or 30W wired charging Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal Product Price This 5K battery pack was the winner for slimmer 5K magnetic power banks in our recharging tests, recharging a faded iPhone 16 Pro by 79%.
Belkin and Amazon offer a choice of colors (It’s available in a range of colors (White, Blue, Sand, Blue, Citrus Yellow, and Gold), and the Apple Store now has an exclusive set of new colors, including a brighter Pink, Deep Purple with a red stand and Teal with a yellow stand
The Belkin’s kickstand is easy to use and feels robust, and the battery pack itself is marginally smaller than the Ugreen. The $49.99 Torras MagStall Power Bank is a little slimmer but wider and boasts a stand/finger-grip, although recharges to a slightly lesser extent. Pros
Fastest 25W wireless or 30W wired charging
5000mAh battery capacity Retailer Price View Deal Product Price This 25W wireless power bank lived up to its claims of wirelessly charging an iPhone 16 Pro from 0% to 50% in 32 minutes—12 to 15 minutes faster than a 15W power bank. That might not sound a lot but when you’re in a rush to charge your phone, every minute counts. 25W wireless charging is limited to the iPhone 16 and 17 families, running at least iOS 26; older iPhones will charge at 15W using this power bank.
The Baseus PicoGo Magnetic 10K Power Bank (AM61) is an output blazer is more ways than one. It is certified Qi 2.2 so charges wirelessly at 25W. The built-in USB-C cable is rated at 45W, which is fast enough to keep even a MacBook going. Pros
Compact iPhone, Watch, AirPods charging stand
10K power bank
Foldable for travel Retailer Price OneAdaptr View Deal Product Price This compact OneGo power bank has it all: it can charge four devices at the same time—including iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods, plus another via its side USB-C port—and then folding up into a lightweight form that can slip into your pocket or overnight bag. iPhone Gift Guide: USB-C iPhone chargers
A simple charger sounds like a boring present but we think any iPhone users would be delighted to receive one of these beauties now that Apple no longer includes one in the box with new iPhones. And which iPhone users couldn’t do with at least one more spare charger at home or in the office—or a special one for travel?
An iPhone charger should be rated at least 20W, and we’d recommend 30W or better as newer iPhones can accept higher wattages than even Apple admits. A 30W charger can handle an iPad Pro and has just enough to power up even a 13-inch MacBook Air.
For more details and options, read our Best Picks roundup of the best iPhone chargers. Further down we recommend some multi-device chargers that might make more of an impact come unwrapping day. Pros
Cute robot-shaped charger
Two color options Retailer Price View Deal View Deal Ugreen View Deal View Deal Product Price The latest GaN (Gallium Nitride) chargers are tiny so we’re used them them being labeled “cute” but this small phone charger really is cute, shaped like a friendly robot. Take off its boots and you’ll find the plug prongs that connect straight into a wall power socket. The boots are even magnetic. Why? We don’t know but you can store the plug protector on most metal surfaces when the charger is in use. When plugged in, the LED screen shows different expressions that refer to the charging states. Its 30W power is enough to fast charge even the biggest iPhone. You’ll need a USB-C to USB-C cable to charge an iPhone 15/16/17 and USB-C to Lightning cable for older iPhones. It’s even powerful enough to keep a small MacBook charged. Pros
Smallest, lightest 30W charger
Foldable plug
Multiple color options Retailer Price View Deal View Deal Anker View Deal Product Price Measuring just 1.12 × 1.12 × 1.39 inches (U.S. model), the 30W Anker USB-C Nano Charger is the smallest 30W USB-C charger we’ve had in our labs for testing, and it weighs just 1.3oz (36g). The U.K. model is larger but also features foldable prongs and is equally incredibly light. It’s available in a range of pastel colors, including Misty Blue, Lilac Purple, Phantom Black, Aurora White, and Natural Green. Pros
Small, light 45W charger
2 ports
Foldable plug Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal Ugreen View Deal Product Price This two-port wall charger from Ugreen is great if your household or office has two phones—one doesn’t even need to be an iPhone! Indeed you could charge your iPhone plus Apple Watch or AirPods, too. Each USB-C port is rated at 45W so one could charge a mid-sized laptop. Using both ports, one will give 25W and the other 20W—enough for a reasonably fast charge. It’s a great compact choice for homes with a couple of devices in need of a power boost. iPhone Gift Guide: MagSafe chargers
While charging using a USB-C cable (USB-C to Lightning for older iPhones, and USB-C to USB-C for the iPhone 15 and later) from your charger is the fastest way to charge an iPhone, more convenient is wireless charging. Since the iPhone 12, wireless charging has become more efficient and therefore faster with Apple’s MagSafe technology that magnetically clamps the iPhone more securely to the wireless charger.
You can buy a simple USB-C to MagSafe charging pad, like Apple’s $39/£39 MagSafe Charger or a third-party alternative, or a multi-device charger that includes a MagSafe charger for iPhone plus a charger for AirPods or Apple Watch. For more details and options, read our Best Picks roundup of the best MagSafe wireless chargers. Pros

Fast 15W for iPhone
Folds for travel Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal Satechi View Deal Product Price We love that once static MagSafe chargers are now folding up into highly portable devices, and that’s certainly true of the Satechi 3-in-1 Foldable Charging Stand. It uses Qi2 magnetic wireless charging tech so can power an attached iPhone at 15W. The 5W Apple Watch Charger is all set for Watch fast charging, and you can place your AirPods case at he front for three-at-a-time charging. Pros
3-in-1 charging
Fastest 25W for iPhone Retailer Price View Deal View Deal Belkin View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal Product Price 2025 saw the release of a new wireless charging technology called Qi 2.2, which allows for super-fast 25W speeds, which is nearly as fast as you’ll get with a less convenient charging cable. 25W works only for the iPhone 16 or 17, with older iPhones stuck at 15W, but this is a great gift for owners of the latest iPhones if they also own an Apple Watch and AirPods. Pros
Charges iPhone and AirPods
Adjustable charging pad Retailer Price Check Product Price This is a great budget option for a stand that will charge both your iPhone and AirPods. At 7.5W, Anker’s stand is not as fast at charging as the 15W or 25W models reviewed above, but it will be fast enough for most of us. If speed is your only priority, charge using a cable! Like those pricier charger options, this charger features an adjustable charging pad, so can be angled to your own requirements. Pros
Charges Watch and iPhone (swap Watch for AirPods)
15W Qi2 for iPhone
Compact and portable Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal Twelve South View Deal Product Price The ButterFly charger from Twelve South is a beautiful piece of design and works exactly as it should. You can charge your iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time, or switch the iPhone for your AirPods case if that is your greater need. It’s a great travel charging companion that easily slips into a pocket. There’s the original metal MagSafe ButterFly model or the more affordable ButterFly SE that uses Qi2 but matches MagSafe for 15W iPhone charging speed. The ButterFly comes in five different color options, two exclusive to Twelve South. Pros
Charges Watch and iPhone (swap Watch for AirPods)
15W Qi2 for iPhone
Compact and portable Retailer Price View Deal Native Union View Deal View Deal Product Price A similar option to the ButterFly is Native Union’s cool and compact Voyage 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger for iPhone and Apple Watch. It comes with a color-matching USB-C cable and pouch to protect the charger when you travel with it. iPhone Gift Guide: Bag
A protective case is a must for your iPhone but what about all the other Apple gear, power banks and gadgetry stuff that needs to come with it? Pros
Dedicated iPhone pocket
Oozes style and practicality Retailer Price Waterfield View Deal Product Price Handcrafted from full-grain leather in San Francisco this refined super-premium crossbody bag from Waterfield features a dedicated iPhone pocket, which you can access one-handed via the clever magnetic closure that eliminates the need for fumbling with zippers. An extra layer of protection, the self-finding magnetic Fidlock buckle secures the flap in place. There’s also a more open slip pocket at the back.
This bag will just as well suit the style-conscious iPhone user who doesn’t want to stuff their device in their back pocket. There’s plenty of space inside (3.5L) the 10-x-7-x-3-inch bag for more than just your phone, with another zipped pocket for your less-often required essentials. The black leather model of the Hudson is the most dressy of this beautiful bag, with the Chocolate and Grizzly colorways a little more casual but still very smart. iPhone Gift Guide: iPhone stands
If you don’t need wireless charging with your iPhone stand, here are our favorite iPhone stands. Pros
Flexible iPhone stand
Folds away to tiny form Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal UAG View Deal Product Price The all-metal UAG Magnetic Ring, in a unique hexagonal shape, adds little bulk or weight to your iPhone and secures magnetically as its name suggests. The ring grip stand features a 360-degree rotation that you can use as a portrait or lanscape kickstand for hands-free viewing or stable selfies. It’s available in a wide of colors: Blue, Pink, Titanium, Black, Olive and, ahem, Nude. Pros
Flexible iPhone stand
Folds away to tiny form Retailer Price View Deal MOFT View Deal Product Price How often do you carry a tripod around with you in case you need to take a group shot or selfie from a distance further than your arm? Or you simply want to flip your phone into a more comfortable viewing position? Inspired by origami, the Moft Snap Wallet Tripod could be several solutions you are looking for. It folds up into a credit-card-sized device that’s just 0.36 inches thick and weighs 4.7oz, so you hardly notice in your pocket even though unfolded it can raise your iPhone by up to 8 inches. It’s clever and you’ll be surprised just how useful it can be. It uses Apple’s MagSafe tech to firmly grasp the iPhone, and then it’s up to you to decide which of the three shapes—floating, stand or vlogging—you want to fold it into. Plus you can store two credit or travel cards in it even when it’s connected to you phone. Pros
360° iPhone stand
Dual-sided magnetic design
Includes finger-friendly grip Retailer Price View Deal Aulumu View Deal Product Price Aulumu calls its lightweight (34g) G09 Infinite Rotation Dual-Mag Stand “the first true 3-axis smartphone stand”. The aluminium alloy stand/grip features precision damping and its dual-sided magnetic attachment means it will securely clamp not just to your iPhone but any magnet-friendly surface on the other side. It can works as a desktop mount, kitchen aid, travel companion, or vlogging accessory. The inner white silicone ring even glows in the dark, and you don’t need to remove the stand when wirelessly charging your phone. Pros
Multiple angles
Foldable Retailer Price View Deal Product Price You could you this nifty stand for anything—video watching, gaming, travel and video calls to name a few activities enhanced by a phone stand—but Apple would like you to take it with your yoga mat to ensure you are hands-free when exercising to its Fitness+ service. The GoStand is built with a composite and silicone construction and steel hinge and features precision indexable back support adjusts with a low-profile button. Pros
Works like AirTag
5-card wallet and stand Retailer Price Journey View Deal Product Price Clamping magnetically to the back of your iPhone, this tri-function wallet stand is good looking and helpful if you misplace your phone. Not only will it hold up to five standard-sized cards but it pulls out to create a versatile stand in either landscape or portrait orientations. On top of that the built-in location tracker works perfectly with Apple’s Find My app so you can track it and make it findable if you’ve mislaid it. It makes a lovely gift for an iPhone users who no longer carries a wallet but still needs a few cards to hand. iPhone Gift Guide: Lightning and USB-C cables
If you thought that chargers might be a boring gift, I hope we’ve persuaded you otherwise. But how would you feel unwrapping a charging cable? Me? I’d be delighted as you can’t own enough charging cables, can you? They are always handy. Sure, it’s not a pony or a new TV but it’s easier to wrap.
Older iPhones will need a USB-C to Lightning cable; check out our roundup of the best Lightning cables. Pair one of these with a USB-C charger, see above, for the fastest charging. An older USB-A to Lightning cable doesn’t support iPhone fast charging.
The iPhone 15, 16 and 17 families now have a USB-C rather than Lightning port so you can use the same cable as you have for your MacBook. We have tested the best USB-C cables for iPhones and can recommend these as great little gifts. Pros
Color options
Robust braided design with rounded head Retailer Price Casetify View Deal View Deal Product Price No wrapping paper is going to look as good as this gift when unwrapped. It’s cute, it’s tough, and it is available in a range of super colors. The PowerThru by Casetify can charge up to 60W, which is more than enough for iPhone charging so could also be used for your USB-C iPad or MacBook. Pros
Tidily retractable
Takes up little space
No knots Retailer Price View Deal Baseus View Deal Product Price Cables are by definition awkward things to carry around. They get tied up in knots all by themselves, are a unsightly nuisance, and are tricky to store. This thin 3.3-foot (1m) or 5.5ft (2m) USB-C cable is retractable so will slip into a drawer or pocket without dangling around getting in the way. You can buy it in black, white, purple or blue and is rated to support 100W so it can be used to charge your MacBook, too.

### 17. `EN` [iOS 26.4's New CarPlay Video Feature Shown in Action](data/articles/fd3b527df676acf28f2c69cf2cb6c911.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Back at WWDC 2025, Apple revealed that it was planning to allow CarPlay users to watch video via AirPlay in their vehicles while they are not driving, and the first beta of iOS 26.4 suggests the feature may be nearing availability. There are several new references to CarPlay video streaming functionality within the iOS 26.4 beta's source code. The feature is not yet visible to users, but software developer Thomas Dye managed to get it working to some extent in Xcode's CarPlay simulator on the Mac, and he showed it off in a recent YouTube video (via 9to5Mac). On an iPhone connected to CarPlay, it appears that videos in any AirPlay-supported app can be played on the car's display. In the Dynamic Island, there is a button that allows you to show the video on the iPhone instead, when you want to. The demo also reveals that an Apple TV app will be available on CarPlay, allowing you to access shows and movies from the Apple TV streaming service and your own library. There is also a tab for accessing MLS Season Pass. However, it is not entirely clear if the Apple TV app will actually be this fully featured on the real version of CarPlay. The simulator provides an early albeit fairly clunky look at CarPlay's video streaming in action. The feature will likely be available by time iOS 26.4 is released to the general public in late March or early April, but there is a chance it will get held back until iOS 26.5 or later if Apple needs more time to wrap up development. indicates that automakers will need to implement support for the CarPlay video functionality, due to the safety requirement that the vehicle be parked, so it may take some time for the feature to widely roll out.

### 18. `EN` [iPhone 17 Pro Max Curiously Becomes Most Traded-In Smartphone](data/articles/a667bc6318951b8eee0e8e209ff70564.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
New trade-in data indicates that Apple's iPhone 17 Pro Max has rapidly become the single most traded-in smartphone. According to a new report from SellCell, Apple's latest flagship iPhone has quickly risen to the top of the independent trade-in market, accounting for 11.5% of all devices appearing in the top-20 trade-in rankings just months after release. The analysis is based on SellCell internal trade-in data and secondary market pricing trends gathered from 40 independent ‌iPhone‌ buyers. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max's share of the top-20 trade-in rankings increased from about 5.1% in late November to 11.5% by early February, more than doubling in approximately 12 weeks. 86% of traded-in units were categorized as being in mint or good condition, suggesting many owners are selling soon after purchase. iPhone 16 Pro Max and ‌iPhone‌ 13 sit at 7.2% of trade-ins each. The top-20 devices collectively represent around 47% of all trade-in activity. Trade-in rankings typically reflect a wide mix of devices at different points in their lifecycle, with older models often dominating resale volume due to large installed bases and the natural upgrade cycle. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max's rapid rise is therefore notable because the device only entered the market relatively recently yet has already become the most frequently traded-in model across the tracked channels. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max has apparently lost approximately 25.4% of its value since launch when measuring average resale prices for mint-condition devices over a 145-day period. Over an equivalent timeframe, the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max lost roughly 32.5% of its value. This represents more than 7% lower depreciation for the newer model and translates to as much as $95 in additional retained value compared with the previous generation over the same period.

### 19. `EN` [Low-Cost MacBook Expected on March 4 in These Colors](data/articles/f67e38ec21c08df032924b9c7d8ef9bd.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple will announce its rumored low-cost MacBook at its event on March 4, with the device coming in a selection of bold color options, according to a known leaker. Earlier this week, Apple announced a "special Apple Experience" for the media in New York, London, and Shanghai, taking place on March 4, 2026 at 9:00am ET. Instant Digital" said that the color scheme of the Apple logo graphic used for the upcoming "Apple Experience" should match the colors of the new entry-level Mac. The invite graphic shows a 3D Apple logo made up of transparent discs in yellow, green, and blue. The post effectively constitutes a claim that the device is set to arrive at the event. In June 2025, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the more-affordable MacBook could come in silver, blue, pink, and yellow finishes, which would match the entry-level iPad. In his latest newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple has tested a range of playful color options for its upcoming low-cost MacBook, going well beyond the muted tones available on its current laptop lineup. Gurman said the colors tested so far include light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray, although he added that it is unlikely all of them will ship. The color palette would make the budget MacBook the most colorful laptop Apple has offered since the iBook G3 era in the late 90s, which included Tangerine, Blueberry, Indigo, Graphite, and Key Lime. iPhone chip, likely the A18 Pro, rather than an M-series processor. It will likely retail for well below $1,000.

### 20. `EN` [10 Reasons to Wait for Apple's iPhone 18 Pro](data/articles/e28384c919c1fb419b4a06e38475b882.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max. One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle this year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027. Overall Design iPhone 17 Pro Style Rumors suggest the iPhone 18 Pro lineup will largely retain the same design as the iPhone 17 Pro models. The rear camera system will look identical to the current generation, featuring a raised "plateau" with three lenses arranged in a triangle. Display sizes are also expected to remain unchanged, with the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max continuing to use 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch panels, respectively – the same dimensions introduced with the iPhone 16 Pro series. iPhone 18 Pro models could drop the current two-tone look of the rear casing found on the iPhone 17 Pro in favor of a more seamless aesthetic. For the next-generation models, Apple has apparently updated the back-glass "replacement process" to minimize the color difference between the Ceramic Shield 2 glass and the aluminum frame, resulting in a more unified appearance. Next-Level Battery Life Thicker Chassis The iPhone 18 Pro Max will feature a bigger battery for continued best-in-class battery life, claims a Chinese leaker. The Weibo user known as "Digital Chat Station" said that the ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max will have a battery capacity of 5,100 to 5,200 mAh. (The iPhone 17 Pro Max has the biggest ‌iPhone‌ battery to date at 5,088 mAh. Apple says it has a battery life of up to 39 hours.) According to another rumor, the body of the iPhone 18 Pro Max will be slightly thicker than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, raising the device's weight to around 243 grams. That would make the iPhone 18 Pro Max approximately 3 grams more than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is currently the heaviest model Apple has produced. A larger battery is the most likely cause. Smaller Dynamic Island Under-Screen Face ID? Rumors continue to circulate about whether the iPhone 18 Pro models will introduce under-display Face ID, but reports remain divided on when the technology will actually arrive. The feature would move the TrueDepth camera system beneath the display, eliminating the need for the current Dynamic Island cutout. Wayne Ma of The Information, Apple is targeting a design without a Dynamic Island, replacing it with a single pinhole camera in the upper-left corner of the screen. However, other sources dispute that claim. Display analyst Ross Young believes under-display Face ID is possible for the iPhone 18 Pro, but says a smaller Dynamic Island will still be present. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has echoed this view, reporting that the new models will feature a slimmed-down Dynamic Island rather than removing it entirely. Apple is also said to be testing new camera miniaturization technology to reduce the size of the front-facing camera currently located within the Dynamic Island. claimed the Dynamic Island cutout on the iPhone 18 Pro models will be approximately 35% narrower than it is on the iPhone 17 Pro models. Specifically, they said it will have a width of around 13.5mm, down from around 20.7mm Instant Digital has offered yet another version of events, saying the Dynamic Island will shrink in size, but that under-display Face ID and camera technology won't debut this year. Overall, the consensus suggests Apple may be refining the Dynamic Island before fully transitioning to an all-screen design in future generations. A20 Pro Chip 2nm Process The iPhone 18 Pro models will use Apple's A20 chip, based on TSMC's 2nm process for power and efficiency improvements. A move to 2nm fabrication increases transistor density, which will enable higher performance. The A20 series is expected to deliver roughly a 15 percent speed gain and about 30 percent better efficiency compared with the A19 series used in Apple's iPhone 17 models. Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) technology, suggesting at least some A20 chips will have RAM integrated directly onto the same wafer as the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, rather than sitting adjacent to the chip and connected via a silicon interposer. This could contribute to faster performance for both overall tasks and Apple Intelligence, and longer battery life from improved power efficiency. C2 Modem Replacing Qualcomm Apple plans to include its next-generation C2 modem in the iPhone 18 Pro models, according to supply chain analyst Jeff Pu. The chip will succeed the C1 modem, which debuted in the lower-cost iPhone 16e as Apple's first in-house cellular modem, and the C1X modem chip in the iPhone Air, which Apple says is up to 2× faster than the C1. The C2 is expected to bring faster speeds, improved power efficiency, and support for mmWave 5G in the United States – a feature missing from the C1 and C1X. Apple's modem roadmap is part of a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on Qualcomm, which currently supplies 5G modems for the rest of the iPhone lineup. The company has been working on developing its own cellular chips for years, aiming for deeper integration and greater control over power management and performance. New Camera Sensor Samsung-Made Samsung is working on a new three-layer stacked image sensor, reportedly intended for the iPhone 18. The sensor, referred to as PD-TR-Logic, integrates three layers of circuitry, which would improve camera responsiveness, reduce noise, and increase dynamic range. The leak comes from a source known as "Jukanlosreve," who claims the sensor is being developed specifically for Apple's 2026 iPhone lineup. Sony has long been Apple's sole image sensor supplier, so Samsung's entry would be a big shift in the iPhone's camera supply chain. Variable Aperture DSLR-Style Apple intends to equip this year's iPhone 18 Pro models with a variable aperture lens, according to reports. Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station claims the main rear camera – what Apple calls the 48-megapixel Fusion camera – on both iPhone 18 Pro models will offer variable aperture, which would be a first for the iPhone. A variable-aperture system physically adjusts the lens opening, letting more light in for low-light shots or narrowing the opening for brighter scenes and deeper depth of field. November 2024 that Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models will get the feature. 5G Satellite Internet Non-Terrestrial Data According to a report by The Information, Apple plans to add support for 5G networks that operate via satellites rather than Earth-based towers as early as next year. This advancement would allow future iPhones to gain full internet connectivity through satellite, not just limited emergency features. If Apple meets the 2026 target, the first devices to feature 5G satellite internet would likely be the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and the long-rumored foldable iPhone. Apple partners with Globalstar for its iPhone satellite features, but there is currently no service that delivers full 5G satellite internet directly to a smartphone, and the report did not specify who would supply it. Simplified Camera Control New Design Apple is reportedly working to simplify the Camera Control button's design on iPhone 18 models in order to reduce costs. The current Camera Control button on iPhone 17 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the force sensor recognizes different pressure levels for taps, presses, and swipes. remove the capacitive sensing layer and retain only pressure sensing recognition in the second iteration to achieve all Camera Control functions on the iPhone 18. The simplified version is not about reducing functionality in the button, but about saving money. The current solution is said to be very expensive for Apple and is generating costly after-sales repairs. New Colors Three in Testing Apple is rumored to be testing three new color options for the iPhone 18 Pro models: burgundy, brown, and purple. A burgundy finish would mark the first time the Pro and Pro Max models have been offered in any shade of red, apart from the lighter (PRODUCT)RED used on earlier devices. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were previously available in Deep Purple, and Apple has never released an iPhone in a genuinely brown color.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Code references in the latest version of iOS point to what might sound like a surprising new feature in CarPlay: the ability to play movies and TV shows in your car.
iOS 26.4, which has just launched in beta form, contains two giveaway strings, both of which mention an important safety measure. “When you’re not driving,” reads the first, “open Apple TV on iPhone and review the privacy information.” While the second reads: “When you’re not driving, sign in to Apple TV on iPhone.”
These code strings were spotted by the MacRumors analyst Aaron Perris, who posted his discovery to Twitter/X. The Apple news site 9to5Mac further spotted five references that contain the words “CarPlayVideoPlayback,” juxtaposed with terms such as “ClimateControls” and “Notifications.”
It’s worth noting that while these snippets point to the feature approaching launch, the concept is not a total surprise. “Video in the car” was originally announced as part of the iOS 26 update last year, and is still mentioned in the CarPlay section of Apple’s developer site.
“AirPlay video in the car enables people to watch their favorite videos from iPhone right on their CarPlay display when they aren’t driving,” the page explains. “Integrate support for CarPlay with AirPlay video to enable this feature in your car.”
That’s the key: it was left up to automakers to authorise and integrate the feature. And up to now, no automaker has chosen to do that, or announced that it intends to do so in the future. But this latest discovery hints that progress is finally being made.

### 22. `EN` [Best laptop power banks for Apple MacBook 2026](data/articles/2944d303396b843aca0d5e717169e4ff.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Many of us are quite used to carrying around a handy power bank to top up our iPhone batteries during a long day away from a power socket, but these pocketable battery packs are usually not powerful enough to keep an unplugged and energy-hungry MacBook going all day.
We’ve rounded up the best portable laptop power banks with battery capacities high enough to recharge a fading Apple MacBook if you won’t be able to plug it into an electrical outlet for some time.
Despite new laptops boasting improved battery life duration, it’s easy for your trusty MacBook to lose power after a day of intense meetings and PowerPoint presentations. No one wants to see the Mac’s “Your battery is running low” warning, especially when halfway through watching a downloaded Netflix series on a long-haul flight.
We looked at seven main factors for recommending laptop power banks: battery capacity, charging speed, total power output, power input, USB ports, portability and safety. For more details on each see below this list of the best MacBook power banks.
Power vs portability
As a rule, the higher the battery capacity, the larger and heavier the power bank. We have included size and weight so you can determine if each power bank suits your traveling needs. Some laptop power banks are built to last in the great outdoors so will feature more rugged IP-rated shells; read on for our reviews below.
There are much smaller, lighter and more portable power banks for phones—check out our recommendations of the best power banks for iPhone. You could use some of these to recharge a laptop but we recommend the power banks tested and reviewed here for the best results when powering up a laptop.
There are some giant power banks, usually called portable power stations, that can keep a family going all weekend, but they are way too large to carry with you on your travels. We have tested the most MacBook-friendly models in our roundup of the best portable power stations.
Macworld Test Score
We test each power bank’s real-world charging prowess by recharging a spent 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro from 0% to 100% (or as far as it gets) and then repeat, adding the two percentages together to create a comparable Test Score.
Which power bank is best for your MacBook in 2026?
We have indicated which models of MacBook we think each power bank is best suited to, but that doesn’t mean you can’t pair any with different MacBooks. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W so owners of that model should look for a PD 3.1 power bank. But even a 13-inch MacBook Air will work well with the higher-capacity power banks. They might not charge any faster, but they will be recharged more times if you pick a high-capacity battery pack. Pros

The Anker Prime 26K Power Bank (300W) is one of the most powerful laptop power banks that you can match with your MacBook. It is a great fit with the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has a battery rated at around the same watt hours (99.6WH) as this power bank (99.75Wh).
There are three USB ports. Each of the two USB-C ports can be used to power at 140W. Attach Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable or the included 240W USB-C cable to the power back and you can utilize one of the 140W PD 3.1 ports to fast-charge the 16-inch Pro. Indeed, with its 300W total output at your disposal you could fast-charge two of the top-end MacBooks at the same time and still have enough juice to fast-charge your iPhone!
Anker claims that you can fast-charge that top-end MacBook Pro up to 50% in 27 minutes. In our tests, we charged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to full power with enough left over to power it back to 25% on the second recharge.
You can recharge the power bank itself to 50% in under 150 minutes using the two USB-C ports at the same time at an impressive 250W.
This is a sophisticated power bank with some tricks of its own. It can be controlled by an app, which gives real-time charging stats (Remaining Charging Time and Input and Output power indicators) and can be optimized to help extend the battery life of the devices being charged as well as its own. You can even use the app’s Find Device feature to activate a sound alert from the power bank when you need to locate it.
Anker also sells a 27K Prime Power Bank, available in either black or gold colors. We prefer the 26K model as it’s a little smaller, performed better in our tests, and out guns the 27K model in total output (300W vs 250W) and input (250W vs 170W).
Who should buy the Anker Prime 26K 300W Power Bank?
Powerful enough to charge two 16-inch MacBooks at the same time, this power bank is a great travelling companion for any of Apple’s laptops. Both its 300W total output and 250W input are top-end for a truly portable power bank.

Although a little larger and heavier than the Anker Prime 26K 300W Power Bank, reviewed above, the EcoFlow RAPID Pro 27K Power Bank (300W) has a hidden weapon in its battle for the best MacBook power bank: a built-in retractable USB-C cable tucked away in its base—saving you from carrying a spare cable around with you and keeping your travel bag neat and tidy.
Like the Anker Prime 26K, this power bank can fast-charge two 16-inch MacBook Pros at full pelt. It boasts the same 200W total output, and has two more USB-C ports—both at a potential 65W—but no legacy USB-A port. If you need a USB-A port, look to the Anker Prime instead. USB-A aside, it can recharge up to four devices at the same time, although. With three devices it can output at 140W, 95W and 65W—enough for three MacBooks at the same time. And using all four charging points, still allows for two MacBooks at 140W. with the remaining two USB-C ports sharing 20W.
In our tests it scored 120%—a little lower than the Anker Prime’s 125% but nothing substantial in comparison. It can be recharged itself at 280W, which is a little faster than its Anker rival.
Who should buy the EcoFlow RAPID Pro 27K 300W Power Bank?
As powerful as the Anker Prime 26K Power Bank and boasting a built-in USB-C cable plus an extra port, the EcoFlow RAPID Pro is a real rival for the crown. If you can take the (minimal) extra weight and don’t need a USB-A port, it is highly if only for the retractable cable.

The Ugreen 48000mAh 300W Portable Power Bank is the missing link between a laptop power bank and a full-blown power station. It has a huge battery capacity but is still portable, although you wouldn’t want to carry it around in your backpack all day, and it’s too powerful to take on a commercial flight.
It has a handle so is carriable, but the bulk and weight mean it is one to move around inside or carry in a car. It would be the perfect power companion on a camping trip. It’s not super-heavy, but it is noticeably larger than the other laptop power banks tested here.
Keep it powered up in case of power outages and it should keep your laptop and phone going for days. In our tests we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro 1.8 times, so you can expect to get maybe as many as two charges for a MacBook Air. The Pro charged from 5% to 90% in an hour, which impressed us.
There are five ports (three USB-C and two USB-A) with a maximum simultaneous power output of 300W. As it has a 140W PD 3.1 USB-C port, it can be used to fast charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro. At the same time, you could charge another top-end MacBook Pro at 100W, and use one of the USB-A ports at 22.5W.
The smart display shows the remaining battery, total input and output power.
Who should buy the Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank (300W)?
Portable but certainly not pocketable, this is the border between power banks and power stations and would be a great travel gadget if you have a vehicle to carry it in. It is also a mini-prepper’s safeguard against power outages at home.

Retractable cables are very in right now—although nicely tucked away when not in use—for power banks and chargers. This 20K Ugreen Nexode Power Bank has one 2.1-foot retractable 100W USB-C cable nestled and ready for action right next to another 100W USB-C port and a 33W USB-A port.
At under 19oz it’s a little lighter than the cable-friendly Anker 25K 165W power bank, reviewed below, and is half an inch shorter, too. Although it matches the Anker on 165W maximum power output and 100W ports it does have a smaller battery capacity—although is therefore $20 cheaper. In our tests the 25K Anker recharged a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 92% while this 20K Ugreen power bank reached a respectable 78%.
In the battle for power and cable convenience, these two power banks must be chosen on capacity, portability and price.
Who should buy the Ugreen Nexode 20K 165W Power Bank?
This mid-range laptop power bank is compact and lightweight with a handy retractable cable, and will get your MacBook back up to about three-quarters power on a single recharge. Ugreen Ugreen sells another 20K model with a built-in USB-C charging cable. The $79 Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh 130W (above) is shorter at 5.1 x 2.1 x 1.9 inches (12.9 x 5.3 x 4.8cm) and $20 cheaper with the same 20K capacity but a lower max power output of 130W vs 165W. It weighs fractionally less than the 165W Nexode. Buy the 130W model if all you need is to charge a MacBook at 100W and an iPhone at 30W—this stubbier cousin may be all you need. It’s integrated 5.4-inch USB-C cable—useful for MacBooks and later iPhones—is nowhere near as long as the 165W model’s 2.1ft retractable cable but it can double up as a carry handle. Buy the 165W model if you regularly charge two laptops at the same time: one at 100W and the other at 65W. On both 20K models, the USB-A output can be handy for legacy devices.

The performance is impressive—we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to a respectable 92%, not far off the 100% from its slightly higher-capacity sibling Anker 27650mAh power bank—but what we love about this laptop battery pack is its handy 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable USB-C cable that means you don’t have to carry one with you when you take the power bank walkies. There’s even a second built-in USB-C cable that doubles up as a carrying loop.
Each USB-C port can output and provide input at 100W.
The cable wraps neatly into a groove at the top of the power bank. There’s spare USB-C and USB-A ports on one side, so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Note that if you want to charge more than one device, they must share the maximum output of 165W between them. However, 165W can only be supplied by two devices; with three and four devices, the maximum output is limited to 133W, although that is likely enough for most needs.
It’s available in either Space Black or Silver.
With its integrated cables this is one of the the most travel friendly laptop power bank we’ve tested.
A cheaper alternative is the 65W Baseus Free2Pull Power Bank that features one retractable USB-C cable, which is available in the U.S. at Amazon or in the U.K. via AliExpress.
Who should buy the Anker Power Bank (25K, 165W) with Cables?
If you frequently recharge multiple devices at the same time, maybe one integrated USB-C cable won’t be enough for you. This power bank boasts two cables, and performed well in our tests.

The INIU P62-E1 20000mAh (65W) Power Bank may have a dull name but it stands out a mile with its colorful looks—it’s available in six bold colors—and dare-to-be-different compact shape.
Not just fun to look at and easy to hold, it performed excellently in our tests, recharging a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 87% from a flat start, outperforming our 20K power bank, the Ugreen Nexode 20000mAh Power Bank, reviewed higher up, by nearly 10%. That Ugreen power bank features an integrated retractable USB-C cable and is more powerful with 100W outputs and a maximum 165W power—beating the 65W INIU.
The INIU P62-E1 might not have a retractable cable but it does boast a removable USB-C cable that creates a handy carrying loop.
While 65W is a little lacking—but not unusable—for the Pro MacBooks it’s ample for the MacBook Air. Who should buy the INIU Cougar 20K (65W) Power Bank?
Stand out from the crowd with this cute and compact laptop power bank that offers impressive performance for MacBooks that don’t require top-end power output to fast charge. That said, even MacBook Pro owners may desire something as lovely as the Cougar.

The Anker Prime 20K Power Bank is a laptop power bank that is lighter and smaller than the top-end Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank, but boasts the same number of USB ports.
Anker has a couple of 20K laptop power banks that are worth considering. The latest model is the 3-port Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (220W), which boasts two 140W PD 3.1 fast-charging USB-C ports and a 22.5W USB-A. When charging with all three ports at the same time, it offers two 100W outputs and a 20W. With two it can output two USB-C at 110W or one at 140W and the USB-A at 22.5W.
The older but slightly cheaper Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (200W) doesn’t feature the 140W PD 3.1 USB-C ports, instead packing two 100W USB-C ports and a generous 65W USB-A port. That doesn’t rule it out as a battery pack for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it can’t fast-charge Apple’s largest laptop. Its maximum output of 200W is a little below the 220W model.
Both feature a clear display but only the 220W model works with the Anker app. While the 27650mAh Anker Prime can be charged itself at 200W, the two Anker 20K Power Banks can be charged at a lower, but still reasonable, 100W using just one of its USB-C ports.
The 200W model is noticeably shorter than the 220W, measuring 4.9 x 2.1 x 2 inches (12.7 x 5.5 x 5cm) compared to the 220W’s 5.8 x 2 x 1.7 inches (4.4 x 5.0 x 14.7cm), although the 220W is a little lighter at 1.1lbs (510g) compared to the 200W’s 1.17lbs (529g).
The 200W model is cheaper at $139 compared to the 220W model’s $179 price tag, but both appear quite expensive when compared to some rival 20K power banks; see the Ugreen 20K Power Bank reviewed below. The 200W model fared impressively in our recharge test.
Who should buy the Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (220W or 200W)?
Although priced at a premium, these are great options for the smaller MacBooks unless you need as much power in the bank as you can carry. If you don’t need the 140W outputs, the 200W model will save you some cash, or consider the lower-output Ugreen Nexode 20K Power Bank below..
Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Thomas Bergbold Ugreen’s equivalent to the Anker Prime 20K Power Banks is the much cheaper $89 Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh, pictured above. The battery capacities of both are identical, but the Ugreen is noticeably lighter (1lb or 480g) even though its dimensions are closely aligned: 5.1 x 2.1 x 2.0 inches (13.1 x 5.4 x 5.1cm). Each has a smart display that tells you more than enough about what’s going on between the power bank and the devices being charged.
The Ugreen Nexode is a more portable solution, but we still prefer the Anker Prime model for both its impressive USB ports. The Anker has two 100W USB-C ports, while the Ugreen’s USB-C ports are rated at 100W and 30W. As the Ugreen power bank has a maximum power output of 130W, this doesn’t matter, but the Anker can pump out up to 220W simultaneously, making its powerful ports more useful. Power input is also better on the Anker (100W) vs the Ugreen (65W).
However, we’ve seen the Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh priced a lot more competitively than the Anker Prime 20K, and that weight difference may be important to you. Also, for the lone traveller one port for the MacBook and another for fast-charging an iPhone or iPad might be all that’s required. Read our full Ugreen Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh 130W review.

The Cuktech 15 Air laptop power bank we tested might not perform to the same degree as more expensive rivals but offers great value for money, and is hand-grip portable. Its color smart display has all the charging info you should require: battery level, input and output power, and estimated recharge time.
Its 15K (15000mAh) battery managed to charge our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to 54% power. That’s not as impressive as the 20K power banks reviewed here but it’s one of the cheapest MacBook battery packs that we trust.
You can use it as a multiple-charge iPhone power bank, too: it should charge an iPhone 17 Pro Max around 1.6 times. With the three USB ports all in action, you can charge the MacBook at 65W and share the remaining 33W between the other USB-C and USB-A ports.

The Cuktech 15 laptop power bank we tested might not perform to the same degree as more expensive rivals but offers great value for money.
Despite its somewhat confusing name, the Cuktech 15 has a 20K (20000mAh) battery that managed to charge our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to 60% power. That’s not as impressive as other 20K power banks reviewed here but at under $50/£50 it’s one of the cheapest MacBook battery pack that we trust.
You can use it as a multiple-charge iPhone power bank, too: it should charge an iPhone 15 around 3.5 times. You double-click the power button to enter low-power mode for devices such as a smartwatch or headphones.
With the three USB ports all in action, you can charge the MacBook at 65W and share the remaining 20W between the other USB-C and USB-A ports.

A little cheaper than the higher-capacity Cuktech 20, reviewed below, this slim laptop power bank can also fast-charge even the 16-inch MacBook Pro with its 140W output. The 20 looks the better buy in terms of capacity and at a similar price, but the 15 Ultra has a special feature known as Beast Mode.
While the 25000mAh battery of the Cuktech 20 is certainly worth the small extra investment on this 15 Ultra in terms of capacity, this 20000mAh power bank impresses with its super-speedy 165W input, which means you can recharge itself faster than most using Beast Mode where you use both the USB-C ports to recharge the power bank up to 70% in around 20 minutes.
The smart display shows you what each of the ports is doing, battery status, connected devices, and when the unit is powering up in Beast Mode.

Outdoor adventurers and in-the-field professionals need devices that are stronger than softy office desk jockeys and occasional airport travelers, and the Sandberg Survivor boasts a tough !P66 shell that is impervious to water and dust. As such it is bigger than most power banks but it would survive outdoors much longer and has a big enough battery to keep a bunch of devices charged up before being introduced to a wall charger again.
Behind a protective rubber flap there are three USB ports: two old-school USB-A and one USB-C. We would have preferred more USB-C, which is used on most modern devices, and that singular USB-C port is also where you will charge the power bank itself. The USB-C port outputs at up to 65W and receives power at 60W. Each of the USB-A ports can output at 18W. Total simultaneous power output is 65W. Uniquely, there is also a 24W DC 5525 port if your devices can be powered using this connection.
As it charges at a maximum 65W, it’s better suited to the lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro and 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air, rather than the more powerful versions of the 14- and 16-inch Pro MacBooks that prefer a 100W or higher charger. That said, if your 16-inch Pro is on an outdoors adventure, the Survivor will still charge it, just a little slower than a 100W or 140W power bank.
Who should buy the Sandberg Survivor Powerbank?
If the other laptop power banks reviewed here look too fragile for your next trip to the mountains or jungle, the Survivor is built to take some punishment—just look out for your MacBook! Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air or any adventurer’s laptop Pros

Built for travel, this combo 4-in-1 wall charger and 10K battery pack can charge a laptop at 45W as a power bank and at 65W when plugged directly into a wall power socket. It comes with international plug adapters for U.K., E.U. and AU/NZ that slip onto the built-in U.S. foldable prongs—great for travel or just use in your own region. It even has a fold-out rubber handle that you can use to attach it to your backpack while hiking.
Its 10000mAh battery capacity is certainly not the highest of the laptop power banks we have reviewed here, but it did recharge a completely faded 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro back up to 45%, which should get you an extra few hours charge when on the move, depending on your laptop’s battery health.
Its two USB-C and one USB-A ports make it a capable AC wall charger, and a magnetic side pad works as a 15W Qi2 wireless charger for the MagSafe-ready iPhone 12 to 16 families. If charging by wall, the USB-C port output is 65W. When operating as a power bank, the USB-C port outputs 45W, unless also wireless charging when the maximum out put is 30W (15W wireless plus 15W USB-C).
A smart displays shows the power bank’s remaining battery charge, remaining time to full charge, real time output/input, and temperature.

Both a 20K power bank and mini desktop charger (when connected to a USB-C wall charger). this stubbily compact battery pack features a 100W USB-C port at its rear and a 45W USB-C and 22.5W USB-A port at the front underneath a large color smart display. While certainly portable it isn’t one to slip in your pocket or clamp to your phone on the move—the Nexode Qi2 is aimed at the iPhone using laptop owner. It’s a handy travel companion that should handle most of your power bank needs while out and about, and then sit on a desk as a smart-looking and informative charger that can charge four devices simultaneously.

The Cuktech 20 Power Bank 25000mAh 140W PD 3.1 power bank looks a lot like the Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, in a tall format with an informative smart display.
As with the Anker, there are three USB ports, with one at the required 140W for fast-charging a 16-inch MacBook Pro. The other two ports aren’t as powerful as the Anker’s though: 45W vs 140W, and 30W vs 65W.
An M2 MacBook Air should be fully charged with a little power left over for your iPhone, AirPods or Apple Watch.
Power input is also not as great, but at 110W it’s impressive enough compared to most. Maximum simultaneous power output is 210W—again not as high as the Anker but still respectable. The Cuktech’s display gives more data than the Anker, which is informative for wattage junkies but probably overkill for most of us, who just need to know how much battery life remains in the power bank. Anker’s dedicated app is perhaps more useful. Again, this is a nice to have and the Cuktech power bank does the important stuff of recharging the laptop at a price point that is noticeably lower than Anker’s.

The Cuktech CP253L is a budget rival to the Anker 165W Power Bank and Baseus Free2Pull Power Bank, and indeed any of the 20K laptop power banks reviewed here. It wins points for its built-in USB-C cable, although at 6 inches (15cm) the cable not as long or handy as the 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable cable on the Baseus.
It is also a less powerful: 45W vs 60W via USB-C, and charges itself slower, too. It recharged our test MacBook Pro to 75%, again a little off the Baseus performance but probably enough for most users in need of a power boost. At 45W it’s fine for the MacBook Air but a little underpowered for the Pro MacBooks, which will charge a little slower.
(We’re only interested in Apple’s MacBook here but if you also own a Xiaomi laptop, its USB-C connectors can charge at 55W and the USB-A supports 33W UFCS charging for some Chinese phones.)
Who should buy the Cuktech CP253L 20K Power Bank?
The lower power input and output plus shorter cable, along with a slightly heavier weight, are compromises you may well overlook when you see the price. This is a great-looking—in either black or a cool white—and solidly performing portable battery pack for your laptop. It’s also available in the U.K. unlike the Baseus.

This is another column-shaped laptop power bank with a high-capacity. The three top-mounted USB ports support PD 3.1 so it is particularly useful for owners of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which can be fast-charged using one of this power bank’s 140W ports. As total power output is also 140W, you can’t charge another device at the same time as fast-charging that top-end MacBook. If you want to simultaneously charge more devices, look for a power bank with a higher maximum power output. The similarly designed Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, can use all three of its ports up to 250W. The Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank, also reviewed previously, is a larger unit but can reach 300W total power output.

Not every product needs to blow us away with some revolutionary new feature or concept. Game controllers have found a fairly mature place, design-wise, so there's no need to rock the boat.
The GameSir G8 Plus is an MFi-certified controller with a USB-C connector, rumble support, programmable buttons, and customization options. It closely resembles the GameSir G8 Galileo that it replaces, but it has some notable improvements. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

In July 2025, after revealing design details of what was then known as iOS 19, leaker Jon Prosser was sued by Apple for the alleged misappropriation of trade secrets. Things seemingly haven't gone well so far, even as he continues to post videos about Apple rumors.
Prosser has been served with document and deposition subpoenas. He'll have to provide sworn, out-of-court testimony so that Apple can determine the scope of the confidential information Prosser obtained and shared. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

Apple's camera and microphone indicators are supposed to tell iPhone users when the microphone or camera are on, but after a device is fully compromised with kernel-level access by another hack, Predator spyware can prevent those from appearing. Malware can defeat iOS privacy indicators for recording
Camera and microphone indicators, which first appeared in iOS 14, are a big part of Apple's privacy message. Users depend on them to know when recording is going on.
Security researchers at Jamf found that Predator spyware can prevent those iOS recording indicators from appearing. It's not a standalone attack though — the technique is post-compromise behavior, and the analysis doesn't describe a new iOS vulnerability or a flaw that needs patching.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
West Virginia's Attorney General JB McCuskey today announced a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of knowingly allowing iCloud to be used to distribute and store child sexual abuse material (CSAM). McCuskey says that Apple has opted to "do nothing about it" for years. "Preserving the privacy of child predators is absolutely inexcusable. And more importantly, it violates West Virginia law. Since Apple has so far refused to police themselves and do the morally right thing, I am filing this lawsuit to demand Apple follow the law, report these images, and stop re-victimizing children by allowing these images to be stored and shared," Attorney General JB McCuskey said. According to the lawsuit [PDF], Apple has described itself as the "greatest platform for distributing child porn" internally, but it submits far fewer reports about CSAM than peers like Google and Meta. new child safety features, including a system that would detect known CSAM in images stored in iCloud Photos. After backlash from customers, digital rights groups, child safety advocates, and security researchers, Apple decided to abandon its plans for CSAM detection in ‌iCloud Photos‌. "Children can be protected without companies combing through personal data, and we will continue working with governments, child advocates, and other companies to help protect young people, preserve their right to privacy, and make the internet a safer place for children and for us all," Apple said when announcing that it would not implement the feature. later explained that creating a tool for scanning private ‌iCloud‌ data would "create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit." West Virginia's Attorney General says that Apple has shirked its responsibility to protect children under the guise of user privacy, and that Apple's decision not to deploy detection technology is a choice, not passive oversight. The lawsuit suggests that since Apple has end-to-end control over hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure, it is not able to claim to be an "unknowing, passive conduit of CSAM." The lawsuit is seeking punitive damages and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection measures. Tag: Apple Lawsuits

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple's iPhone satellite capabilities can grow, but physics are remorseless. There's still a limit on how much satellite internet can do and how fast it can do it — unless Apple produces a case that it has been researching that doubles as a big antenna.
When Apple first launched Emergency SOS via Satellite with the iPhone 14 back in 2022, it was remarkable idea that since then has saved many lives. Apple has improved it since, and has plans for much more in future, but there is always an issue over establishing the satellite contact.
Users have to point their iPhone in the direction of a satellite orbiting the Earth, and then keep pointing at it as the satellite moves relative to the sender. One single low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite will cross from horizon to horizon in seven minutes, but line-of-site connection time is less than that in real life, and depends on buildings, trees, and terrain.
The iPhone software helps locate and track the satellite. The iPhone antenna still has a small surface area, and isn't that high-powered. Only so much data can reliably be sent before the satellite has moved away.
Now in a newly-revealed patent application originally filed in 2024, Apple has shown how it has been researching a way around this. "Electronic Device and Case with Satellite Communication Capabilities" details ways of using a case to act as an antenna for the iPhone. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld We now know the date of Apple’s next event-type thing: March 4. But as ever, we won’t know the precise details or the products the company plans to announce until it chooses to make that information public.
Unusually, however, there’s a good chance that Apple will tell us about the new products first and host the event (or, to use the company’s preferred terminology, the “experience”) after. Because one respected pundit has put forward the theory that Apple will announce new iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks via press release on Monday to Wednesday of that week, before journalists and influencers are gathered for a hands-on session with the hardware.
John Gruber, writing on his Daring Fireball blog, ponders the large number of Apple releases that are expected in the next few months. We’re waiting for the iPhone 17e, he notes, new versions of the entry-level iPad (with an A18 or A19 chip) and iPad Air (with an M4), M5 Pro and Max MacBook Pro, M5 MacBook Air, and the rumored low-cost MacBook with an A18 chip. That’s a lot to fit into a single event. Perhaps too much.
“What strikes me is that March 4—the ‘experience’ day—is a Wednesday,” Gruber writes. “So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the ‘experience’ will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos.”
Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who is generally keyed into Apple’s product launches, responded on X, saying Gruber’s guess “is exactly what I am expecting based on what I’ve heard.” Gurman has previously reported that Apple had a product launch slated for March 2.
There is a precedent for this sort of serial press release strategy. At the end of October 2024, Apple sent out announcements on consecutive days for the M4 iMac (October 28), M4 Mac mini (October 29), and M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro (October 30). The company even called this an “exciting week of announcements,” even though it only lasted for three days and wasn’t especially exciting, focusing only on the Mac section of its product portfolio. A week of announcements covering the iPhone, iPad, and Mac might do a better job of qualifying for that adjective.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld In a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple has three wearable devices in the works that could establish Apple as a leader in AI hardware. Apple is “ramping up work” on smart glasses, a pendant, and AirPods with IR cameras. The three devices will not be stand-alone products and will require an iPhone connection. Apple smart glasses
Smart glasses appear to be the priority for Apple—don’t expect Apple glasses to be an augmented reality version of its Vision Pro headset. These glasses will be more like the Meta AI glasses, with a high-resolution camera capturing photos and video. The UI will depend on speakers, microphones, and a separate camera dedicated to “give the device environmental context.” Users will be able to make phone calls, use Siri, play music, and shoot photos. Also, the user will be able to “take actions based on surroundings.”
Gurman reports that Apple hopes its camera technology will separate it from Meta’s glasses. Apple is working on advanced features, such as the ability for the glasses to recognize text and convert it digitally, and the ability to create context-aware reminders, such as a prompt to tell you to pick up an item you are looking at that’s on your shopping list while in a grocery store. For navigational directions, Siri could provide landmarks instead of generic instructions. Apple also thinks it can offer superior build quality that differentiates it from Meta. The glasses will use “high-end materials, including acrylic elements intended to give the glasses a premium feel.” Different styles could be offered as the product matures over time. Apple had looked into partnering with a glasses maker, but decided against it.
Gurman stated that Apple made “significant progress” in the development of the glasses, and it could be ready for production by the end of the year, with a public release in early 2027. Apple AI pendant

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple has a new AirTag for sale, but you’re probably not rushing out to buy one since you can still get the old ones for cheaper. But this deal may change your mind: Costco is throwing in a free AirTag when you buy a 4-pack for $100, essentially giving you five new AirTags for the price of 4, a savings of $45 on the price of buying five AirTags individually. (Note: You don’t need to be a member to take advantage of this deal.)
Apple’s 2nd-gen of AirTags have the same size as the previous model, and they look virtually the same. However, they have a louder speaker, which will make them easier to find even if your keys somehow ended up between couch cushions. Apple also upgraded the Bluetooth chip inside the tracker, expanding the range at which items can be located.
Also new is the U2 Ultra Wideband chip, which will make it possible to more precisely locate lost items, something that will definitely be handy. We’ve already tested the new AirTag 2 and gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, finding it to be a simple and efficient Bluetooth tracker that’s also super easy to set up and fairly inexpensive.

Meta has reportedly revived its abandoned Facebook Watch, plans to release it in 2026, and is probably rubbing its corporate hands at what health data it will learn from you, and then turn around and monetize. Facebook Headquarters
Back in 2021, Facebook had plans to make a smartwatch, and it was far enough along that there was even a leaked image of just how much it looked like an Apple Watch.
Nothing came of it back then, but maybe not for technological reasons. It was also in 2021 that the Facebook company was renamed Meta in a feeble attempt to distance itself from its own appalling record on privacy abuses. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

The rumor mill is in overdrive. These are the best candidates — and the also-rans — for what Apple will launch and then have an "experience" to demo on March 4. The more likely Apple launches for early March
It seems the March 4 Apple Experience won't be an actual launch of new products in Apple's catalog, but instead capping off multiple announcements during the week. That gives Apple a lot of opportunity to promote multiple items.
With the breadth of rumored devices on the docket, including many anticipated for launch in early 2026. it certainly needs that opportunity. But, as ever, some have more chance of making an appearance than others. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

In a court case concerning the mental health effects of social media, Mark Zuckerberg's defense includes that he tried to discuss the issue with Tim Cook, who, obviously, doesn't run a social media platform. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg
The trial concerns in part the issue of age verification, which Meta has previously tried to dodge by saying Apple and Google should deal with it rather than any application. The case is a specific one brought to a Los Angeles court by a 19-year-old who claims social media led her to self-harm and suicidal thoughts.
It's being seen, though, as a test case with much wider implications. The unnamed teenager and her mother originally sued Meta, YouTube, Snap and TikTok, although the latter two have settled out of court. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

A February 17 regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows Berkshire trimmed its Apple position during the quarter ended December 31, 2025. Apple was still valued at roughly $62 billion within Berkshire's portfolio at year's end.
The filing also shows Berkshire sold 77% of its Amazon stake in the same quarter, a far more substantial reduction than the modest adjustment to Apple.

Apple may return to its marketing playbook, delivering multiple press releases of big products in just a few days, then highlight them all at the international March 4 "experiences." Apple's experience logo has many layers. The announcement of a special event on March 4 has led to wild speculation of what Apple could introduce at the time. However, with so many oddities surrounding it all, it may not be as straightforward as people think.
On Tuesday, Daring Fireball's John Gruber proposed that Apple's reference of it as an "experience" day is unusual. The choice of holding the event on a Wednesday is also unexpected, especially when you factor in Apple's preference for Tuesday product announcements.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple has made a major announcement this week that could affect the software you use, especially if it’s an older app, and you are using an M-series Mac. In a support document, Apple wrote that it will start to phase out Rosetta functionality with macOS 28. That means in two years, apps that were written for Intel-based Macs will no longer run on M-series Macs, except for “certain older, unmaintained games.”
When Apple began its switch from Intel chips to its own M-series chips in 2020, it changed the architecture of the underlying workings of the Mac. To help navigate the transition, Apple created Rosetta, which acts as a translator of Intel-based apps so they can run on M-series Macs. Rosetta will be included in macOS 27, which is expected to be released this fall. After that, Apple will limit the Rosetta implementation in macOS 28.
It’s been over five years since the first M1 Macs debuted. By the time macOS 28 is released in the fall of 2027, it’ll be seven years–Apple has a history of deprecating products after such time.
Developers have had plenty of time to update their software to either support M-series Macs exclusively or run universally on either chip. You can check an app’s compatibility by selecting the app’s icon and pressing Command+I on the keyboard. This will open a software info window, and in the General section, look at the listing for Kind. This will show one of the following:
Application (Apple silicon): The app was written for Apple chips
Application (Universal): The app was written for both Apple and Intel chips

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Earlier this month, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple had scaled back its plans to launch a new Health+ service and was revisiting its entire health and fitness strategy.
While this could be seen as being another sign of trouble at Apple, as the company is currently mired in an ongoing narrative about its inability to ship AI features it promised nearly two years ago, I choose to see this as the opposite: a promising early sign that Apple’s executives are recognizing that its headlong charge into chasing services revenue might be coming at too high a cost.
The unlikely hero in all this? Apple’s services chief himself, Eddy Cue.
This isn’t good enough
At the end of last year, with the departure of former Apple COO Jeff Williams, Cue took over Apple’s health division. Even though Cue has been at Apple for a very long time, he was new to this group, and it seems to have made a difference. A new leader comes in with no ego invested in the path the group has been walking down, which makes it easier to see things fresh and not be afraid to make changes.
What Cue saw was a team that was busily preparing a new service, Health+, that offered AI-powered coaching features using data from Apple Health. His response seems to have been that, even for the guy whose job it is to grow and maintain Apple’s services business, the service being built was not compelling enough to launch.
But I think it goes deeper than that: The App Store has several apps that mine Apple Health data to generate AI-enhanced health information. What might have felt like an add-on feature a few years ago feels more like table stakes for Apple’s own Health app these days. And, according to Gurman, Cue has asked that a bunch of the features being built for Health+ just be rolled into the Health app.
It’s not Sherlocking
Is it wrong for Apple to look at other apps in the app store, like Athlytic, and realize that its basic, fundamental device features are lacking? This is the classic “Sherlocking” argument, but I don’t agree with it. There is a base level of functionality that Apple should be providing with every device it sells.

Les ateliers de cartographie sont organisés dans le cadre du projet Missing Maps, qui a pour objectif de cartographier de façon préventive les régions vulnérables aux catastrophes naturelles, crises sanitaires, environnementales, aux conflits et à la pauvreté. On peut penser qu’aujourd’hui toutes les parties du monde sont cartographiées, mais en réalité de nombreuses régions ne possèdent encore aucune carte!
​ Pour qui? Pas besoin d’être un·e expert·e, les ateliers sont accessibles à tout le monde!
​ Où ? 100% en ligne! Un lien de connexion vous sera envoyé après votre inscription
​ ? Avec la plateforme de cartographie libre et contributive OpenStreetMap (OSM, le «Wikipédia des cartes») tout le monde peut participer à la cartographie de n’importe quelle zone de la planète: il suffit d’un ordinateur, d’une souris et d’une connexion internet! Accessibles à tout·es, nous serons là pour vous accompagner pour vos premiers pas avec OSM.
Le programme des mapathons
18h00: Introduction, présentation de la cartographie collaborative et solidaire et démonstration OSM pour les nouveaux·elles
18h30: On cartographie tous ensemble sur un projet
20h00: Fin du mapathon, conclusion sur les contributions de la soirée

gull, paulla, logiciels-libres, projets, futur, assemblée-générale [FR Paris] Soirée de contribution au libre – Le jeudi 12 février 2026 de 19h30 à 22h00.
Le but des soirées de contribution au libre est de proposer un espace de travail partagé aux personnes actives dans le libre en Île-de-France le temps d’une soirée, une fois par mois (le deuxième jeudi du mois plus précisément).
Dit plus court: c’est un lieu avec de l’électricité et une connexion internet. En avant les claviers !
Les soirées de contribution au libre sont faites pour vous si:
vous travaillez sur un projet libre et vous recherchez une atmosphère à la fois conviviale et studieuse pour aller de l’avant et, qui sait, créer des connexions avec d’autres projets libres, vous êtes un collectif autour du libre et vous cherchez un lieu pour vous retrouver physiquement et avancer avec efficacité sur vos chantiers. Si vous n’avez pas envie de contribuer à un projet libre, les soirées de contribution au libre ne sont sans doute pas faites pour vous. Pas de panique, Parinux organise d’autres évènements:
si vous voulez discuter autour du libre: l’Apéro du Libre (APL) est là pour ça ; c’est un rendez-vous fixé tous les 15 du mois ; venez-nous retrouver autour d’un verre pour papoter et refaire le monde (libre), si vous avez un problème informatique: c’est la vocation de Premiers Samedi du Libre (PSL) où vous pourrez trouver des oreilles attentives et compétentes à l’écoute de toutes vos questions. Nous nous réservons le droit de refuser l’entrée aux soirées de contribution au libre à tout personne qui n’en respecterait pas l’esprit. Et, bien sûr, les règles de bienséance habituelles s’appliquent pour que chacune et chacun se sente à l’aise dans un cadre bienveillant.
Si les soirées de contribution vous intéressent, le mieux est de contacter d’abord le CA de Parinux ca@parinux.org. Vous devrez de toute façon nous écrire pour obtenir le code de la porte cochère…

omjc, clx, permanence, linux, gnu-linux, logiciels-libres, atelier [FR Amancy] Rencontre « Logiciels Libres » – Le samedi 14 février 2026 de 09h00 à 12h00.
Rencontre mensuelle autour des logiciels libres, en toute simplicité.
Ces matinées seront ce que nous en ferons ensemble, selon vos attentes:
Découverte des logiciels libres dont Linux et de leur intérêt. Utilisation sur place.
Installations, sur votre machine (pensez à sauvegarder vos données avant de venir avec) ou sur des PC fournis pour apprendre ensemble sans risque. Parfois, on vous propose un ordinateur auquel Linux a redonné une seconde vie, avec lequel vous pouvez repartir…
Préparation d’une clé USB pour tester Linux chez vous, l’installer ou alors pour utiliser des logiciels libres sans installation sous Windows.
Entraide, suivi de votre expérience avec les logiciels libres.
Nous pourrons aussi nous intéresser aux outils en ligne, aux smartphones, ou nous amuser à redonner vie à de vieux PC un peu obsolètes, à reconditionner des ordinateurs pour des associations ou personnes avec peu de ressources, etc.
Pour tout projet qui risque de prendre un peu de temps, il est préférable de nous contacter avant.
Les débutant·e·s sont les bienvenu·e·s! Les autres aussi, bien évidemment !

Quand un développeur demande à Claude ou ChatGPT d’écrire du code, l’IA pioche dans des milliers de bibliothèques libres sans que l’humain ne lise jamais leur documentation. Résultat: les mainteneurs de ces projets open-source, qui vivent de la visibilité générée par les visites et les interactions, voient leur audience s’effondrer. Une étude économique chiffre ce paradoxe: l’IA qui accélère le développement logiciel asphyxie l’écosystème qui le rend possible.

### 4. `FR` [L’ANSSI révise sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre](data/articles/8a512e5cc7bbd13459cb5362176c6f21.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) vient de publier une mise à jour substantielle de sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre. L’agence confirme que le logiciel libre et la transparence sont essentiels à la sécurité des systèmes d’information. Elle assume sa contribution au libre et la publication de logiciels sous licence libre.
Cette posture très favorable au logiciel libre et open source est une belle avancée et un signal fort. Jusque-là, la posture de l’ANSSI était beaucoup plus floue et sa contribution à des projets libres et open source pouvait même apparaitre en contradiction avec sa doctrine. J’avais l’impression que les collaborateurs de l’ANSSI qui le faisaient reprenaient à leur compte le dicton « Pour vivre heureux, vivons cachés ».
La politique de l’agence est désormais claire : l’ANSSI contribue, l’ANSSI publie, l’ANSSI a une stratégie pragmatique qui peut l’amener à s’engager ou non sur le long terme en fonction de la finalité de l’outil et des motivations de l’ANSSI.
Détail qui a son importance, l’ANSSI indique privilégier, sauf exception justifiée, la licence Apache v2.0 pour les projets qu’elle publie. Je suis ravi de voir ce service privilégier une licence mondialement connue à une licence franco-française ou européenne (elles ont le don de doucher nombre de velléités d’utilisation et de contribution). lien nᵒ 1 : L’ANSSI met à jour sa politique open source (9 février 2026)

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’association Drupal France &amp; Francophonie organise la 13ème édition du Drupalcamp les 9, 10 et 11 avril 2026 au campus Universitaire Grenoble Alpes de Grenoble (France, Isère 38). Drupal est « un système de gestion de contenu (CMS) libre et open-source publié sous la licence publique générale GNU et écrit en PHP ».
Après Rennes en 2024, puis un Barcamp à Perpignan en 2025, cette année 2026 nous emmène au pied des montagnes à Grenoble pour un format de 3 jours de rencontres, soit deux journées de conférences les jeudi et vendredi. La journée du samedi est réservée à la contribution.
Des moments d’ateliers et micro-formation sont également au programme, pour faire de cet évènement une réussite d’un point de vue communauté autour du projet Open Source Drupal.
Le Drupalcamp Grenoble c’est la rencontre de la communauté francophone autour du logiciel libre Drupal. Ouvert à toutes et tous, les rencontres, conférences et ateliers permettent d’adresser à un public toujours plus large des sujets et thématiques diversifiées.
Notre objectif principal est de rendre la création de sites plus simple et la gestion des contenus plus intuitive pour tous. Comme de fédérer les utilisateurs et professionnels qui utilisent Drupal au quotidien.
Du simple curieux au développeur expert, tous ceux qui s’intéressent à Drupal et aux logiciels libres pourront participer à cette manifestation rythmée par :
des conférences (jeudi 9 et vendredi 10 avril), données par des professionnels reconnus et des membres de la communauté Drupal au cours desquels des thématiques nouvelles seront explorées,
des sessions de découverte étayées par des démonstrations à l’intention d’un public plus néophyte,
une journée de formation gratuite (Drupal in a Day) dédiée à l’initiation pour que les curieux puissent se lancer dans la création de leur premier site (sur inscription)
des moments de réseautage et de convivialité avec, notamment, la très attendue soirée communautaire !

Utilisateur de Canoprof depuis 2019, cet outil est devenu un des piliers de ma pratique d’enseignement en Physique-Chimie (4ᵉ, 5ᵉ, 3ᵉ) et en Sciences (6ᵉ). Je l’utilise pour concevoir l’ensemble de mes supports aussi bien papier que numériques, ce qui me permet de maintenir une cohérence didactique forte sur l’ensemble du cursus collège.
La force de Canoprof réside dans la séparation claire entre le contenu et la forme. En tant qu’enseignant, cela me permet de me concentrer sur le fond pédagogique et la structuration de mes séquences, sans perdre de temps dans les contraintes techniques de mise en page. La richesse de mon fond documentaire, construit depuis plus de six ans, évolue ainsi sereinement au fil des réformes et de mes retours d’expérience.
Canoprof m’aide à formaliser une progression spiralaire efficace tout en générant des supports propres, structurés et accessibles. C’est un gain de productivité précieux qui me permet de consacrer plus d’énergie à l’accompagnement de mes élèves en classe. Guillaume Marmin, enseignant de physique-chimie au Collège Isabelle Autissier. Modèle utilisé : Canoprof Rencontres Scenari 2026 à l’ENSAM Aix-en-Provence 22-26 juin Les Rencontres Scenari 2026 auront lieu du lundi 22 juin (midi) au vendredi 26 juin (midi) sous le soleil provençal à l'ENSAM Aix-en-Provence.
Bloque ces dates dès maintenant, les détails seront précisés bientôt. Tu peux parler de Scenari aux conférences éclair de l’April ? Lors de la prochaine assemblée générale de l’April (samedi 28 mars 2026 à Paris) il y aura un temps de conférences éclairs (6 minutes) de 10h à 12h qui s’enchaîneront sur des sujets variés, en lien avec le Libre, entendu au sens large.
Si tu utilises Scenari, c’est une bonne opportunité pour parler de tes usages auprès des adhérent⋅e⋅s de l’April. Date limite pour proposer : 15 mars. Envoyer un courriel à confseclairs@april.org.
Il n’est pas nécessaire d’être adhérent⋅e à l’April pour pouvoir proposer une conférence éclair.
Plus de détails sur l’annonce de l’April. Nouvel habillage web pour Optim 24 Un nouvel habillage graphique pour Optim 24 fait son apparition sur la plateforme de téléchargement.
Il existe pour tous les supports web des 3 modalités d’Optim : site normal, site web simple, site web en tuiles. Mise-à-jour de Myscenari MyScenari vient de passer en version 6.4.5 (corrections de bugs dans le cœur et dans les modèles en version 25). Attention : cette version est la dernière à contenir Dokiel 5 et 6, Opale 5 et 24, Optim 3 À partir de la prochaine mise à jour de MyScenari, nous n’aurons plus que Dokiel 25, Opale 25, Optim 24. Pense à migrer tes modèles (et skins) pour ne pas être pris⋅e au dépourvu au dernier moment. Nouvelles versions d’outils Scenari Opale, le modèle phare pour créer vos contenus pédagogiques, passe en version 25.1.1. Au menu, entre autres : corrections dans les outils d’accessibilité, et amélioration de l’intégration de MindMap dans la publication Diapo. Et Opale est maintenant disponible en allemand ! Parcours, pour concevoir des conducteurs pédagogiques, passe en version 25.0.2 (corrections mineures sur le skin, l’éditeur et les vidéos HLS) et est disponible maintenant en français et Anglais. Dokiel, le modèle pour la documentation technique et logicielle, passe en version 25.0.6. Cette version apporte entre autres des corrections dans la publication de relecture et l’écran de contrôle, et l’amélioration des écrans décrits dans les publications Web (maintenant responsive). Optim monte en version dans ses deux saveurs Optim 24.0.7 et OptimPlus 24.0.3 avec des corrections mineures sur les publications Web et Diaporama, et dans le styage. LTI-suite, le serveur pour exploiter des ressources SCORM dans des LMS via LTI, passe en version 2.0.3. Lexico, votre modèle pour créer des lexiques, glossaires, thesaurus, vocabulaires, monte en version 25.0.1 pour apporter des corrections mineures dans la publication Web. SCENARIchain-desktop est à présent disponible en français, en anglais et en espagnol. Le savais-tu ?

One of the limitations of the AMDGPU Linux kernel graphics driver has been the lack of its support for HDMI 2.1 and later.

But anxious independent users have been working on open-source patches for wiring up HDMI 2.1 into the AMDGPU driver outside of the realm of AMD and the HDMI Forum's blessings...

### 16. `FR` [Physiocab : un logiciel libre de gestion pour kinésithérapeutes](data/articles/e0eab329ba8752732324b8914ae82b51.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Physiocab est un logiciel libre de gestion de cabinet de kinésithérapie, développé sous licence Affero GPL 3.0 et hébergé sur Codeberg. Le projet est porté par la société Allium SAS, dans le cadre de la plateforme communautaire Kalinka, dédiée aux kinésithérapeutes francophones.
Le projet vient de passer en beta publique (v0.9) et cherche des testeurs et contributeurs.
Pourquoi un logiciel libre pour les kinés ? Le secteur de la santé libérale souffre d'une offre logicielle dominée par des solutions propriétaires onéreuses, souvent opaques sur le traitement des données de santé. Physiocab propose une alternative : un code auditable, des données stockées localement sous la responsabilité du praticien. lien nᵒ 1 : La page de présentation du projet
lien nᵒ 2 : Le dépôt codeberg
lien nᵒ 3 : PeerJs (MIT) Fonctionnalités
La beta couvre déjà un large périmètre fonctionnel :
Planning hebdomadaire en drag &amp; drop, avec export PDF et gestion des semaines exceptionnelles, particulièrement orienté vers les kinés intervenant en multi-établissements.
Bilans Diagnostiques Kinésithérapiques (BDK) avec tests standardisés (TUG, Tinetti, Handgrip, EVA, évaluation du risque de chute…), export de PDF et historique comparatif.
Suivi des séances avec de multiples exercices structurés (équilibre, force, endurance, mobilisation), chronométrage automatique et calcul de progression.
Application tablette en PWA : fonctionne hors connexion grâce à un Service Worker, s'installe sans passer par un store, interface optimisée tactile.
Stack technique
Backend : Python 3.10+
L'application est multi-plateforme côté client (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). La communication entre l'appli de bureau et l'appli PWA se fait de manière directe via PeerJs. Cette méthode ne nécessite pas de préparation contraignante comme l'ouverture de ports.
Les données sont stockées localement, ce qui implique que le praticien reste maître de ses sauvegardes et de sa conformité RGPD.
Le logiciel a été testé par un kinésithérapeute en situation réelle plusieurs jours d'affilée.
Modèle économique
L'utilisation est gratuite, sans limite dans le temps et sans frais cachés, la licence Affero GPL 3.0 en étant la garantie. Un support payant sur devis est proposé pour les praticiens souhaitant une installation assistée, une formation à distance, des développements sur mesure ou un audit de sécurité.

Various forms of tools, colloquially known as "AI", have been
rapidly pervading all aspects of open-source development. Many
developers are embracing LLM tools for code creation and review. Some project maintainers complain about suffering from a deluge of slop-laden pull
requests, as well as fabricated bug and security
reports. Too many projects are reeling from scraperbot attacks that
effectively DDoS important infrastructure. But an AI bot flaming an
open-source maintainer was not on our bingo card for 2026; that seemed
a bit too far-fetched. However, it appears that is just what happened
recently after a project rejected a bot-driven pull request.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
En février, il y a la corvée commerciale de la Saint-Valentin et les réjouissances intellectuelles consécutives à la sortie d’une nouvelle version de la suite bureautique LibreOffice. C’est, bien évidemment, sur LibreOffice 26.2 que l’on va se pencher. Au menu, du très visible, comme les boites de dialogues, du très attendu comme la prise en compte du Markdown ou du moins visible comme le travail sur l’accessibilité.
Il va de soi que les notes de version sont plus exhaustives et qu’il ne s’agit ici que d’une sélection. lien nᵒ 1 : Notes de version Sommaire
L’accessibilité
Support du Markdown
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Writer
Calc
En vrac
Pour finir
Avant de commencer : toutes les captures d’écran ont été faites, volontairement, sur une interface très personnalisée.
L’accessibilité
L’accessibilité de la suite bureautique est un important chantier pour lequel une personne a été recrutée en 2023 (en). Cette version-ci a fait l’objet d’améliorations sensibles. Parallèlement, Sophie Gautier, coordinatrice de The Document Foundation1 (Foundation coordinator) est en train de monter un groupe de travail qui a pour objectif la publication d’un rapport de conformité en matière d’accessibilité pour répondre à la norme européenne EN 301 549 (en) d’accessiblité numérique. La langue de travail de ce groupe est l’anglais.
Concernant les améliorations de cette version :
la boite de dialogue « Vérifier les mises à jour », Aide &gt; Vérifier les mises à jour… est devenue accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
les fonctions d’accessibilité des aperçus des bordures, onglet « Bordures » des boites de dialogue, ont été revues afin qu’elles ne perturbent plus les dispositifs d’assistance ;
sur Linux : la boite de dialogue Outils&gt; Orthographe est annoncée correctement par le lecteur d’écran ;
quand on supprimait la sélection accessible, le curseur se déplaçait automatiquement au début du texte, ce comportement perturbant est supprimé ;
dans Writer, les fautes d’orthographe ne sont plus signalées par les dispositifs d’assistance si la vérification orthographique n’est pas activée ;
l’accessibilité au clavier de la boite de dialogue des extensions : Outils &gt; Extensions est accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
et enfin, il est possible de naviguer entre les onglets verticaux avec des raccourcis clavier.
Support du Markdown
Le Markdown est devenu le format de balisage léger standard « de fait ». Et c’est celui supporté par LinuxFR. Son support a été introduit dans cette version, c’est un des formats d’enregistrement qui s’est ajouté à la série des autres formats de la suite, pas un format d’export. Pour l’utiliser pour vos sites, passant pour LinuxFR, vous devrez :
soit ouvrir le fichier .md dans un éditeur de texte, n’importe lequel, même Mousepad fait l’affaire par exemple, et copier-coller ensuite le tout à partir de l’éditeur de texte là où vous le voulez ;
soit, si cela est possible, importer le fichier .md dans ce qui vous sert pour gérer le site comme le fait par exemple l’extension ODT2SPIP pour le système de gestion de contenu SPIP qui permet de créer une nouvelle page dans SPIP avec un fichier.ODT. ça marche avec LinuxFR ? Plutôt bien. Les styles de caractère Accentuation (ici en italiques) et Accentuation forte (ici gras) sont bien reconnu ainsi que Texte source pour « télétype », les indications in-texte encadrées de l’accent grave U+0060. Les styles de paragraphes :
Bloc de citation (paragraphes de citation précédés d’une ligne blanche et du signe « &gt; » dans la saisie de contenu sur LinuxFR) ;
Contenu de tableau ;
Corps de texte ;
Liste, par contre la numérotation des listes ordonnée ne semble pas bien fonctionner, il faut saisir les numéros à la main ;
Texte préformaté pour écrire des blocs de code ;
Titre 1, Titre 2, Titre 3 et Titre de tableau.
Les tableaux sont bien repris ainsi que les liens insérés via l’insertion d’hyperliens.
Ce qui ne semble pas fonctionner du tout : ce sont les notes, elles disparaissent corps et biens. C’est peut-être dû au passage dans l’éditeur de texte qui transforme un peu le document. Et, évidemment, il faut rajouter les images avec la syntaxe LinuxFR.
La version de Mardown de LibreOffice est CommonMark (en) et la bibliothèque utilisée est MD4C avec quelques extensions prises en charge par cette bibliothèque (cf ce rapport de bug (en) et ses réponses), pour en savoir plus, voir cette note (en) du blog de The Document Foundation.
Petite remarque, si vous utilisez un LibreOffice 25.8, vous avez peut-être pu constater qu’il était question d’enregistrement au format .md, cette information a été ajoutée trop précocement car la version 25.8 ne gère pas le Markdown.
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Les boites de dialogue, notamment de styles et de formats, ont beaucoup changé. Longtemps elles se sont affichées avec une présentation par onglets en haut et le contenu dessous.
Puis il y a une période de transition en 2025 qui a fait grincer une collection complète de dents où on avait, selon l’endroit où on était, soit des onglets soit une navigation par menu latéral. Cette dernière avait un gros défaut : par exemple pour la configuration des styles dans Writer il fallait descendre tout en bas pour accéder aux options qui étaient cachées. Et il n’y avait pas de barre de défilement pour aller plus vite.
LibreOffice 26.2 voit ces défauts corrigés : les boites de dialogue sont harmonisées dans toute la suite et leur menu latéral, toujours sans barre de défilement qui s’avère finalement inutile, montre clairement tous les types de paramètres auxquels on peut accéder. Et, comme on peut le voir, LibreOffice a intégré une meilleure prise en charge des systèmes d’écritures asiatiques et complexes en affichant deux colonnes, une pour les polices occidentales, ou pour les polices asiatiques ou complexes. Une personne a également été recrutée en 2023 (en) pour travailler sur le support des systèmes d’écriture de droite à gauche (RTL) et complexes (CTL). Si toutefois, vous préférez revenir à l’affichage avec les onglets, il suffit d’aller dans le menu Outils &gt; Options &gt; Apparenceau niveau de « Boites de dialogue » et cocher l’option Horizontal en haut. Il faut savoir que les onglets en haut ne s’affichent que sur une seule ligne et qu’il faudra donc naviguer avec les flèches quand il y a de nombreuses options. Writer
Il y a un certain nombre d’amélioration autour de la compatibilité avec le format DOCX : séparation de tableaux flottants en plusieurs tableaux, suppression de la numérotation des notes de bas de page à l’ouverture d’un fichier DOCX, etc.
On relèvera deux nouvelles options d’alignement des paragraphes : « Début » et « Fin ». Si vous utilisez l’alphabet latin, vous ne verrez aucune différence avec les deux options « Forcer à gauche/en haut » et « Forcer à droite/en bas ». Elles ont été développées pour réutiliser plus facilement les styles entre les divers systèmes d’écriture. Pour continuer sur la lancée du travail pour la prise en compte des systèmes d’écriture dont le fonctionnement est différent de celui de l’alphabet latin, il est possible de changer la direction du texte : de gauche à droite ou de droite à gauche en cours de travail. Cela peut se paramétrer dans les styles. Calc
Un gros travail sur les performances a été fait : vitesse de défilement, rapidité des classeurs avec de nombreuses formes et du rejet des modifications. On voit apparaître de nouvelles options de tri (Données &gt;Trier) qui dépendent de la « locale » (langue définie dans les Options de LibreOffice). On peut ainsi déterminer quel caractère est utilisé comme séparateur de décimal pour le tri naturel. On peut relever aussi une avancée ergonomique qui va plaire à toutes celles et ceux qui utilisent les matrices, on peut maintenant modifier les formules matricielles avec la combinaison de touches : F2 + ↑ Maj + Ctrl + Entrée, il n’est plus nécessaire de modifier la formule elle-même.
Et aussi : si vous utilisez (pourquoi diable ?) le format d’enregistrement XLSX, c’est le format EXCEL2010+ qui est le format par défaut, il change de nom pour devenir « Classeur Excel 2010-365 ».2
En vrac
Base est devenu complètement multi-utilisateur, TDF a, d’ailleurs, recruté une personne pour travailler sur l’application.
Concernant les diagrammes (ou chart) : dans le Volet latéral, quand le graphique est en mode modification et que l’on va, au niveau de « Couleurs », sur la palette, on a une prévisualisation en direct dans le diagramme ce qui permet de tester le choix de couleurs plus facilement.
Les polices embarquées dont la licence ne permettait pas l’édition étaient jusqu’à présent ignorées et remplacées à l’affichage, ni vu, ni connu par une fonte de substitution. Ce défaut a été corrigé.
L’export PDF gère les liens avec les documents externes : Fichier &gt; Exporter au format PDF &gt; Liens. Les dictionnaires hongrois, mongol et portugais du Portugal ont été mis à jour ainsi que les règles de césure de la langue hongroise.
JSON, pour JavaScript Object Notation, est un format standard utilisé pour représenter des données structurées. Il est utilisé notamment pour échanger les informations entre un navigateur et un serveur. C’est, par exemple, le format de sauvegarde des marques-pages de Firefox ou de certains fichiers d’archives de Mastodon. Les documents XML et JSON génériques avec des plages pouvant être liées sont maintenant automatiquement mappés à des feuilles dans Calc. Une plage pouvant être liée est une section d’un document contenant des enregistrements tabulaires. Lorsqu’un document contient plusieurs plages pouvant être liées, chaque plage est mappée à une seule feuille3.
Et si vous avez envie de vous amuser avec les fonctions expérimentales (à activer dansOutils &gt; Options &gt; LibreOffice &gt; Avancé), vous pouvez jouer avec la nouvelle de boite de dialogue « Gestion des macros ».
Pour finir
Cette dépêche a, bien, évidemment, été rédigée avec LibreOffice et, cette fois-ci dans un fichier enregistré en Markdown. Les seules balises que j’ai dû entrer à la main sont celles des images. Kate a l’air de modifier le fichier et, quand je réouvre le .md dans LibreOffice, il y a des styles qui ont sauté mais la mise en forme reste visuellement la même. Kate rajoute aussi des barres obliques devant les « &gt; », aux crochets [ ] et même à certains hyperliens (images). Il y a peut-être des éditeurs de texte plus adaptés ou des réglages à faire.
J’ai rédigé cette dépêche en même temps qu’un article sur LibreOffice 26.2 pour mon site. Si l’article n’est pas vraiment dupliqué, il n’est pas étonnant d’y trouver des morceaux ici. Que tout cela ne nous empêche d’adresser tous nos remerciements à celles et ceux qui font de LibreOffice une suite bureautique si agréable à utiliser et si performante.
Post-scriptum : si vous voulez savoir modifier les couleurs de l’interface comme sur les captures d’écran, ça peut s’envisager, demandez gentiment, avec un peu de chance.
The Document Foundation ou TDF est la fondation de droit allemand qui pilote le projet LibreOffice. Il y a deux formats OOXML différents et donc deux formats XLSX différents, la version 2007 et la version actuelle depuis 2010. S’il vous est vraiment nécessaire d’enregistrer au format XLSX, il faut utiliser la version de 2010. Notes de version.

### 36. `FR` [Rétablissement de l'« auto-attestation » pour les logiciels de caisse, l'aboutissement d'une année de mobilisation](data/articles/94205d2b52b4c2f91689aa6f73b5cf84.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Avec l’adoption du projet de loi de finances pour 2026, les éditeurs de logiciels de caisse ont retrouvé la faculté d’attester eux-mêmes de la conformité de leur solution, un an après que la certification par un organisme tiers avait été rendue obligatoire. Une mesure salutaire pour la pérennité des logiciels libres de caisse.
La loi de finances pour 2025 avait supprimé la possibilité, pour les éditeurs, d’attester eux-mêmes de la conformité des fonctionnalités d’encaissement de leur logiciel. Ils étaient dès lors tenus de passer par la certification, une procédure lourde et très mal adaptée à la réalité des marchés informatiques et à l’innovation, en particulier pour les logiciels libres. Une réforme actée sans réelle consultation, sans étude d’impact préalable et sans que l’administration fiscale ait exprimé de problème avec le dispositif.
L’April s’est mobilisée, tout au long de 2025, au côté des membres de l’écosystème, pour revenir sur cette réforme. lien nᵒ 1 : Texte provisoire de la loi de finances pour 2026 C’est dans le cadre du projet de loi de finances pour 2026, adopté le lundi 2 février, après une longue procédure et dans un contexte politique tendu, que l’« auto-attestation » a finalement été rétablie. Une mesure salutaire pour la pérennité des logiciels libres de caisse, inscrite à l'article 125 du projet de loi.
Article 125 :
Le code général des impôts est ainsi modifié :
1° Le 3° bis du I de l’article 286 est complété par les mots : « ou par une attestation individuelle de l’éditeur, conforme à un modèle fixé par l’administration » ;
Il ne s’agit pas ici de se prononcer sur la procédure retenue, ni sur le reste du contenu de cette loi de finances. Quoi qu’il en soit, le rétablissement de l’« auto-attestation » est une très bonne nouvelle, tant pour celles et ceux qui développent ou proposent des prestations autour de ces solutions, que pour les personnes qui souhaitent utiliser des logiciels libres pour leurs encaissements. Même s’il est regrettable que de nombreux acteurs économiques du libre aient dû se lancer dans une fastidieuse et coûteuse procédure de certification ou bien envisager des modifications profondes de leur modèle.
Un grand merci à l’ensemble des membres des écosystèmes des logiciels libres proposant des solutions d’encaissement. Sans leur engagement, ce résultat n’aurait sans doute pas été possible. L’April restera vigilante pour que l’« auto-attestation » ne soit pas à nouveau remise en cause sans étude d’impact sérieuse.
Court résumé de la longue procédure qui a conduit à ce résultat :
Pour qu’une disposition soit adoptée, elle doit d’abord être votée de manière « conforme » par les deux chambres parlementaires, c’est-à-dire strictement dans les mêmes termes. Puis, le texte global doit être adopté pour que la mesure devienne loi.
En première lecture du projet de loi de finances pour 2026, l’Assemblée comme le Sénat ont voté pour le rétablissement de l’« auto-attestation », indiquant une volonté claire du législateur en la matière. La première chambre avait toutefois rejeté le texte dans son ensemble, la disposition n’étant pas encore « conforme ». À la reprise des travaux, en janvier, l’Assemblée est repartie de la version du Sénat qui contenait la disposition concernant le rétablissement. Le texte sur lequel le gouvernement a engagé sa responsabilité – article 49.3 de la constitution – reprenait une version « conforme » de la disposition. Les motions de censure ayant été rejetées, le texte a été adopté. Dès lors, il ne restait plus qu’au projet de loi d’être définitivement adopté pour que le rétablissement de l’« auto-attestation » soit acté. Chose faite le lundi 2 février, suite au rejet des motions de censure sur l’ultime recours du gouvernement à l’article 49.3.

**Source:** LWN.net | **Keyword:** `Development`
Justin Wheeler writes in Fedora
Magazine that Fedora is now available in Syria once again:
Last week, the Fedora Infrastructure Team lifted
the IP range block on IP addresses in Syria. This action restores
download access to Fedora Linux deliverables, such as ISOs. It also
restores access from Syria to Fedora Linux RPM repositories, the
Fedora Account System, and Fedora build systems. Users can now access
the various applications and services that make up the Fedora
Project. This change follows a recent update to the Fedora Export
Control Policy. Today, anyone connecting to the public Internet from
Syria should once again be able to access Fedora.
[...] Opening the firewall to Syria took seconds. However, months of
conversations and hidden work occurred behind the scenes to make this
happen.

**Source:** LWN.net | **Keyword:** `Development`
The Asahi Linux project, which is working to implement support for Linux on
Apple CPUs, has published a detailed 6.19
progress report. We've made incredible progress upstreaming patches over the past 12 months. Our patch set has shrunk from 1232 patches with 6.13.8, to 858 as of 6.18.8. Our total delta in terms of lines of code has also shrunk, from 95,000 lines to 83,000 lines for the same kernel versions. Hmm, a 15% reduction in lines of code for a 30% reduction in patches seems a bit wrong… Not all patches are created equal. Some of the upstreamed patches have been small fixes, others have been thousands of lines. All of them, however, pale in comparison to the GPU driver. The GPU driver is 21,000 lines by itself, discounting the downstream Rust abstractions we are still carrying. It is almost double the size of the DCP driver and thrice the size of the ISP/webcam driver, its two closest rivals. And upstreaming work has now begun.

### 1. `EN` [The best earbuds we’ve tested for 2026](data/articles/5487d9ae2c5724b9b8d76fb0f9ffbea0.html)
**Source:** The Verge | **Keyword:** `Tech`
It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds, when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations, companies like Sony, Apple, Bose, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.
Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on. The best wireless earbuds for most people
Sony WF-1000XM5 Score: 8 ProsCons Smaller, more comfortable design
Upgrades to ANC and sound quality
Much clearer voice call performance Glossy texture can make them harder to remove from case
Sony’s bonus features aren’t as seamless as those of its competitors Where to Buy: $329.99 $248 at Amazon $329.99 $248 at Walmart $329.99 $248 at Best Buy Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)
Despite the recent arrival of Sony’s WF-1000XM6 earbuds, the last-gen WF-1000XM5 remain our top recommendation for the best noise-canceling earbuds overall. Thanks to their larger drivers, audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the WF-1000XM4 so enjoyable. They also deliver fantastic active noise cancellation, even if it’s not quite as impressive as it is on the newer XM6 or Bose’s Ultra Earbuds gen 2. The XM5 do a terrific job of eliminating background noise, and battery life can stretch to eight hours with ANC turned on.
Some people found the XM4 bulky and uncomfortable, but Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent (the XM6 are longer and narrower). Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and there’s even a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.
On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds — including Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4, only with substantially better noise cancellation. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, so you can pair them with two devices at the same time.
None of that to say the newer XM6 are a bad choice — quite the contrary, actually. Sony’s latest flagships offer improved sound, handle ambient noise better during calls, and deliver some of the best ANC you can get in a pair of wireless earbuds. But they’re also bulkier and pricier than the XM5 given the latter can often be found on sale for around $250, making the last-gen model a better option for most people.
Read our full WF-1000XM5 review.
The best budget earbuds under $100
Nothing Ear (a)
Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds have the same stylish, semi-transparent design as the company’s other earbuds — but these come in a snazzy yellow. They combine decent ANC, enjoyable sound, and other features like multipoint for under $100. Score: 7 ProsCons Standout color and design
Very compact carrying case
Great performer for the price Limited retail availability
Plastic case can show scuffs Where to Buy: $89 $79 at Nothing $109 $79 at Amazon Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)
When looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. And the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point, especially since they often can be found for as little as $60. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ear 3, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.
Read my Nothing Ear (a) hands-on impressions.
The best noise-canceling earbuds
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen)
The second generation of the Bose Ultra Earbuds carry over the chunky design from the previous gen, with improved ANC and call quality. Score: 8 ProsCons Exceptional ANC
Secure fit
Wireless charging case Bulky design
Merely average battery life Where to Buy: $299 $249.99 at Amazon $299 at Bose $299 $269 at Best Buy Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)
The name Bose has been synonymous with noise cancellation for decades, and it’s again proven why with the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2). They offer the best noise-canceling performance available in a set of earbuds, delivering the peace and isolation many of us crave throughout the day. The second-gen model bring some much-needed improvements to call quality, too, and while they don’t match the performance of our best call quality picks, the AirPods 4 or Samsung Galaxy Buds, the Bose handle noisy environments far better and allow you to sound like you in conversations.
Although Bose added wireless charging and there’s now a little screen in the ear tips to keep earwax out of the earbuds, there’s no visual upgrade to speak of. The second-gen earbuds maintain a chunky look that’s identical to the first-gen QC Ultra Earbuds, which were already extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II. They come with three ear tips and three stabilizer sizes, providing a variety of combinations and a secure fit for different ear shapes.
As with the design, the QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) sound nearly identical to their first-gen counterpart. The bass and treble are boosted, providing more bass than competitors and a lively high-end — although it can get to be a bit much on some tracks. Bose continues to stick with its three-band EQ in the app, which doesn’t allow much meaningful adjustment, but most people will appreciate the stock sound. Bose also continues to offer Immersive Audio, first introduced with the Ultra Earbuds, which is similar to Apple’s spatial audio.
Read our full QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2) review.
The best earbuds for sports and working out
Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 Score: 8 ProsCons Huzzah! Wireless charging!
Adds ANC, transparency modes, spatial audio
Slimmer ear hook, smaller case
Adds heart rate
Great sound
No price hike Case is still a chonker
Heart rate is not that useful for iOS users Where to Buy: $250 $212.49 at Amazon $249 at Walmart $249.99 at Best Buy Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)
After a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-gen pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.
The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users. The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.
If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. Read our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.
The best earbuds for iPhone owners
AirPods Pro 3 Score: 9 ProsCons Improved ANC and sound
Longer battery
Standalone workout tracking
Live translation
Same price
IP57
Better fit
Camera remote control is handy! If you’re hoping for traditional foam ear tips, this isn’t that Where to Buy: $249 $229 at Amazon $249.99 at Best Buy $249 $229 at Walmart Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XXS, XS, S, M, L)
Apple continually adds to the features of the AirPods Pro line — either with a new product like the second-gen AirPods Pro, or with a software update, such as the one that introduced the hearing health features at the end of 2024. The AirPods Pro 3 continue the trend, with improved noise-canceling performance, heart rate sensing, newly designed ear tips with an extra XXS size, and longer battery life. The splashiest update is Live Translation, which, unlike the other improvements, still needs some time to develop into a more streamlined experience.
The new foam-infused earbuds improve passive isolation and, when combined with better ANC performance, deliver the best overall noise cancellation in a pair of Apple earbuds yet. ANC performance is nearly identical to that of the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds (Gen 2), but the AirPods have a slight high-end hiss (though some people might not notice it). A redesign of the acoustic architecture gives the AirPods Pro 3 improved bass performance over the second-gen model, and its spatial audio delivers a wider, richer listening experience.
But what’s important for many Apple users is how well the AirPods Pro 3 fit into the Apple ecosystem. A new heart sensor, first seen with the Powerbeats Pro 2, enables heart rate tracking for 50 workout types from directly within the iOS Fitness app. And unlike the Powerbeats Pro 2, the AirPods can work in conjunction with the Apple Watch, providing a secondary heart rate stream to ensure you always have the most accurate data. Read our full AirPods Pro 3 review.
The best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners
Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro
The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are Samsung’s best-sounding wireless earbuds yet. They have a stemmed design similar to the AirPods Pro, but even if their design is a little bland, the Buds 3 Pro make up for it with great call quality, useful voice commands, and more. Score: 8 ProsCons Terrific sound quality
Crisp, natural transparency / passthrough mode
Voice commands are simple and so useful
Good voice calls Uninspired design
Midtier noise cancellation performance
No true multipoint Where to Buy: $249.99 $199.99 at Amazon $249.99 $169.88 at Walmart $249.99 $179.99 at Target Noise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)
Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds. Boring? Maybe, but thanks to that change, we’ve found them to be more comfortable and provide better stability than the Buds 2 Pro. The sound quality is even better than before — and it was already excellent. These are right up there with Sennheiser and Technics from an audio fidelity standpoint.
The Buds 3 Pro are also a standout performer when it comes to call quality. And our favorite thing about these earbuds are the hands-free voice commands that don’t require you to say any specific wake phrase beforehand. You can just say “volume up” and / or “next song,” and it happens.
But they’re not perfect: the Buds 3 Pro lack multipoint connectivity, so they can’t connect to two devices at the same time. Just like Apple, Samsung prefers to automatically hop between products within its own walled garden ecosystem. Some people might consider this a dealbreaker, but we’ve still enjoyed the earbuds plenty without it.

TP-Link was founded in China, but has attempted to distance itself from the country in recent years. In 2018, the company established a manufacturing facility in Vietnam, and then centralized its global headquarters in the US in 2024, forming TP-Link Systems.
Though TP-Link markets its routers and other products as " …

**Source:** Maddyness | **Keyword:** `Entrepreneuriat`
C’est au lycée que Cédric Le Guern imagine sa première lampe de lecture. « A ce moment-là, je passais mon temps à créer de petits produits, grâce à mon imprimante 3D », raconte l’entrepreneur. Mais ce n’est que quelques années plus tard, alors qu’il est étudiant, qu'il se lance dans l’entrepreneuriat et tente de commercialiser l'une de ses inventions : une petite lampe que l’on peut tenir à une main et qui se positionne en bas d’un livre. « J’ai parlé de mon projet à un ami - Lucas Moysan - qui est devenu mon associé. Ensemble, on a lancé une campagne de financement participatif pour voir s’il y avait un engouement autour de notre lampe », raconte Cédric Le Guern. Et en quelques mois, les deux associés enregistrent près de 4 000 commandes pour un montant de 100 000 euros. « Un record cette année-là sur la plateforme », assure Cédric Le Guern.
2 millions d’euros de chiffre d’affaires en 2025
Très vite, les deux entrepreneurs créent Lizia et industrialisent leur produit pour honorer leurs commandes. En trois ans, ils parviennent à commercialiser 100 000 produits. « La première année, on a réalisé 250 000 euros de chiffre d’affaires », précise l’entrepreneur. Un chiffre multiplié par trois chaque année pour atteindre environ 2 millions d’euros de chiffre d’affaires en 2025.

**Source:** Maddyness | **Keyword:** `Entrepreneuriat`
Faire all-in sur une seule carte peut-il s’avérer fatal ? Au casino, évidemment, mais également en matière d’innovation. A l’heure où tous les regards sont braqués sur l’intelligence artificielle, la France ne cesse d’accélérer dans son domaine, en tout cas en matière de financement, tandis que l’Allemagne opte pour une diffusion plus large de l’innovation dans son tissu industriel. C’est ce qui ressort de l’étude annuelle sur l’évolution des investissements dans la tech des deux côtés du Rhin en 2025 réalisée par le fonds franco-allemand Iris.
De prime abord, les écosystèmes tech français et allemand évoluent dans un contexte relativement similaire, marqué par la raréfaction des tours de table et une montée en puissance inexorable de l’IA. Dans le détail, les investissements dans les startups françaises se sont élevés à 7,2 milliards d’euros (+2 %), malgré un recul du nombre d’opérations (591 tours de table, -24 %). Dans le même temps, ce sont 7,5 milliards d’euros qui ont été investis dans la tech allemande, comme en 2024, avec néanmoins une baisse un peu plus limitée du nombre de tours de table (1 426 opérations, -3 %).
Focus sur l’IA en France, meilleure répartition sectorielle en Allemagne
En revanche, c’est sur la concentration du capital que la différence se fait. En France, les dix plus grosses opérations ont représenté l’an passé 37 % des montants investis, soit 2,6

En 2022, alors que sa mère souffre de bouffées de chaleur liées à la ménopause, Thadée Caron, fondateur d'Athana, cherche quelque chose pour la soulager. « Aucune solution non médicamenteuse satisfaisante n’existait sur le marché. Et en faisant des recherches, je me suis aperçu qu’un milliard de personnes dans le monde souffrait de bouffées de chaleur », souligne l'entrepreneur, qui, en voyant sa mère utiliser des sacs de petits pois surgelés pour se rafraichir, pense à la cryothérapie.
« J’ai mis au point un produit qui diffuse du froid à cinq degrés, sur les zones thermosensibles, comme la nuque ou la poitrine », précise-t-il. Une innovation qui a séduit plusieurs investisseurs dès 2023. « Nous avons fait une première levée de fonds d’1,2 millions d’euros pour construire deux lignes de production dans l’ouest de la France et embaucher quatre personnes », souligne l’entrepreneur, qui a réalisé 300 000 euros de chiffre d’affaires en 2025 et vise 1,5 million d'euros pour 2026.
« Devenir un dispositif médical »
Ses ambitions ont incité Alice Lhabouz à rejoindre l’aventure, sur le plateau de l’émission « Qui veut être mon associé ? », consacré aux inventeurs.

Entre la tech et l’industrie, c’est : «Je t’aime, moi non plus !» Pour réconcilier ces deux univers, pourtant complémentaires et plus encore à l’ère de l’intelligence artificielle, Renan Devillières tente d’apporter une réponse avec OSS Ventures, un venture studio spécialisé dans la création de logiciels industriels B2B.
En ce début d’année, la structure, qui combine donc un startup studio et un fonds d’investissement, annonce un premier closing de 40 millions d’euros pour son nouveau véhicule d’investissement, avec une taille cible de 75 millions d’euros. Pour monter ce fonds, OSS Ventures a pu compter sur soutien de Decathlon Pulse, la branche du distributeur sportif lancée à l’été 2024 pour investir dans les startups du sport et du bien-être, et Teknor Apex. Les investisseurs historiques, dont le groupe Peugeot Frères et Tikehau Capital, ont également remis au pot à cette occasion.
Ce nouveau fonds sera exclusivement dédié au financement en follow-on des entreprises créées par la partie studio d’OSS Ventures. Et ce dans l’optique de leur donner l’impulsion nécessaire pour passer la vitesse supérieure dans leur industrialisation et leur déploiement international en Europe et aux États-Unis.

**Source:** Maddyness | **Keyword:** `Entrepreneuriat`
Recevoir une somme d’argent inattendue comme un bonus, une prime, un héritage, une cession de parts, ou avoir une trésorerie qui gonfle… Cela fait partie de ces “bons problèmes” que l’on rêve d’avoir. Et pourtant. Passé l’euphorie, une question s’impose vite : qu’en faire, concrètement ? Faut-il sécuriser ? Investir ? Attendre une période plus favorable ?
Dans un contexte économique et politique instable, la réponse est d’autant moins évidente. Alors pour y voir plus clair, nous avons interrogé Alexis Trigaut, Directeur commercial et Associé chez CORUM L’Épargne, qui accompagne au quotidien particuliers et entrepreneurs face à ce genre de décisions.
L’argent qui dort… par réflexe de prudence
Le constat de départ est sans appel : les Français épargnent encore beaucoup. Rien qu’en 2025, ce sont 6 600 milliards d’euros qui ont été “mis de côté” dans l’Hexagone et ce alors que, comme le souligne Alexis Trigaut, “les rendements des placements sécurisés comme le Livret A sont faibles, avec un taux de 1,5 % depuis février 2026.
“À l’approche d’une période électorale ou en temps d’incertitude, on observe souvent une contraction de la prise de décision. On repousse ses investissements, on attend de voir.” Une posture attentiste qui n’est pas nécessairement problématique. Attendre peut être une stratégie - à condition que ce soit un choix réfléchi, et non un réflexe subi…

Build Real-Time Knowledge Graphs for AI Agents Graphiti Build Real-Time Knowledge Graphs for AI Agents Help us reach more developers and grow the Graphiti community. Star this repo! [!TIP] Check out the new MCP server for Graphiti! Give Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients powerful Knowledge Graph-based memory. Graphiti is a framework for building and querying temporally-aware knowledge graphs, specifically tailored for AI agents operating in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, Graphiti continuously integrates user interactions, structured and unstructured enterprise data, and external information into a coherent, queryable graph. The framework supports incremental data updates, efficient retrieval, and precise historical queries without requiring complete graph recomputation, making it suitable for developing interactive, context-aware AI applications. Use Graphiti to: Integrate and maintain dynamic user interactions and business data. Facilitate state-based reasoning and task automation for agents. Query complex, evolving data with semantic, keyword, and graph-based search methods. A knowledge graph is a network of interconnected facts, such as "Kendra loves Adidas shoes." Each fact is a "triplet" represented by two entities, or nodes ("Kendra", "Adidas shoes"), and their relationship, or edge ("loves"). Knowledge Graphs have been explored extensively for information retrieval. What makes Graphiti unique is its ability to autonomously build a knowledge graph while handling changing relationships and maintaining historical context. Graphiti and Zep's Context Engineering Platform. Graphiti powers the core of Zep's context engineering platform for AI Agents. Zep offers agent memory, Graph RAG for dynamic data, and context retrieval and assembly. Using Graphiti, we've demonstrated Zep is the State of the Art in Agent Memory. Read our paper: Zep: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Architecture for Agent Memory. We're excited to open-source Graphiti, believing its potential reaches far beyond AI memory applications. Zep vs Graphiti Aspect Zep Graphiti What they are Fully managed platform for context engineering and AI memory Open-source graph framework User &amp; conversation management Built-in users, threads, and message storage Build your own Retrieval &amp; performance Pre-configured, production-ready retrieval with sub-200ms performance at scale Custom implementation required; performance depends on your setup Developer tools Dashboard with graph visualization, debug logs, API logs; SDKs for Python, TypeScript, and Go Build your own tools Enterprise features SLAs, support, security guarantees Self-managed Deployment Fully managed or in your cloud Self-hosted only When to choose which Choose Zep if you want a turnkey, enterprise-grade platform with security, performance, and support baked in. Choose Graphiti if you want a flexible OSS core and you're comfortable building/operating the surrounding system. Why Graphiti? Traditional RAG approaches often rely on batch processing and static data summarization, making them inefficient for frequently changing data. Graphiti addresses these challenges by providing: Real-Time Incremental Updates: Immediate integration of new data episodes without batch recomputation. Bi-Temporal Data Model: Explicit tracking of event occurrence and ingestion times, allowing accurate point-in-time queries. Efficient Hybrid Retrieval: Combines semantic embeddings, keyword (BM25), and graph traversal to achieve low-latency queries without reliance on LLM summarization. Custom Entity Definitions: Flexible ontology creation and support for developer-defined entities through straightforward Pydantic models. Scalability: Efficiently manages large datasets with parallel processing, suitable for enterprise environments. Graphiti vs. GraphRAG Aspect GraphRAG Graphiti Primary Use Static document summarization Dynamic data management Data Handling Batch-oriented processing Continuous, incremental updates Knowledge Structure Entity clusters &amp; community summaries Episodic data, semantic entities, communities Retrieval Method Sequential LLM summarization Hybrid semantic, keyword, and graph-based search Adaptability Low High Temporal Handling Basic timestamp tracking Explicit bi-temporal tracking Contradiction Handling LLM-driven summarization judgments Temporal edge invalidation Query Latency Seconds to tens of seconds Typically sub-second latency Custom Entity Types No Yes, customizable Scalability Moderate High, optimized for large datasets Graphiti is specifically designed to address the challenges of dynamic and frequently updated datasets, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring real-time interaction and precise historical queries. Installation Requirements: Python 3.10 or higher Neo4j 5.26 / FalkorDB 1.1.2 / Kuzu 0.11.2 / Amazon Neptune Database Cluster or Neptune Analytics Graph + Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collection (serves as the full text search backend) OpenAI API key (Graphiti defaults to OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding) [!IMPORTANT] Graphiti works best with LLM services that support Structured Output (such as OpenAI and Gemini). Using other services may result in incorrect output schemas and ingestion failures. This is particularly problematic when using smaller models. Optional: Google Gemini, Anthropic, or Groq API key (for alternative LLM providers) [!TIP] The simplest way to install Neo4j is via Neo4j Desktop. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage Neo4j instances and databases. Alternatively, you can use FalkorDB on-premises via Docker and instantly start with the quickstart example: docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 3000:3000 -it --rm falkordb/falkordb:latest pip install graphiti-core or uv add graphiti-core Installing with FalkorDB Support If you plan to use FalkorDB as your graph database backend, install with the FalkorDB extra: pip install graphiti-core[falkordb] # or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[falkordb] Installing with Kuzu Support If you plan to use Kuzu as your graph database backend, install with the Kuzu extra: pip install graphiti-core[kuzu] # or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[kuzu] Installing with Amazon Neptune Support If you plan to use Amazon Neptune as your graph database backend, install with the Amazon Neptune extra: pip install graphiti-core[neptune] # or with uv
uv add graphiti-core[neptune] You can also install optional LLM providers as extras: # Install with Anthropic support
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic] # Install with Groq support
pip install graphiti-core[groq] # Install with Google Gemini support
pip install graphiti-core[google-genai] # Install with multiple providers
pip install graphiti-core[anthropic,groq,google-genai] # Install with FalkorDB and LLM providers
pip install graphiti-core[falkordb,anthropic,google-genai] # Install with Amazon Neptune
pip install graphiti-core[neptune] Default to Low Concurrency; LLM Provider 429 Rate Limit Errors Graphiti's ingestion pipelines are designed for high concurrency. By default, concurrency is set low to avoid LLM Provider 429 Rate Limit Errors. If you find Graphiti slow, please increase concurrency as described below. Concurrency controlled by the SEMAPHORE_LIMIT environment variable. By default, SEMAPHORE_LIMIT is set to 10 concurrent operations to help prevent 429 rate limit errors from your LLM provider. If you encounter such errors, try lowering this value. If your LLM provider allows higher throughput, you can increase SEMAPHORE_LIMIT to boost episode ingestion performance. Quick Start [!IMPORTANT] Graphiti defaults to using OpenAI for LLM inference and embedding. Ensure that an OPENAI_API_KEY is set in your environment. Support for Anthropic and Groq LLM inferences is available, too. Other LLM providers may be supported via OpenAI compatible APIs. For a complete working example, see the Quickstart Example in the examples directory. The quickstart demonstrates: Connecting to a Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, FalkorDB, or Kuzu database Initializing Graphiti indices and constraints Adding episodes to the graph (both text and structured JSON) Searching for relationships (edges) using hybrid search Reranking search results using graph distance Searching for nodes using predefined search recipes The example is fully documented with clear explanations of each functionality and includes a comprehensive README with setup instructions and next steps. Running with Docker Compose You can use Docker Compose to quickly start the required services: Neo4j Docker: docker compose up This will start the Neo4j Docker service and related components. FalkorDB Docker: docker compose --profile falkordb up This will start the FalkorDB Docker service and related components. MCP Server The mcp_server directory contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Graphiti. This server allows AI assistants to interact with Graphiti's knowledge graph capabilities through the MCP protocol. Key features of the MCP server include: Episode management (add, retrieve, delete) Entity management and relationship handling Semantic and hybrid search capabilities Group management for organizing related data Graph maintenance operations The MCP server can be deployed using Docker with Neo4j, making it easy to integrate Graphiti into your AI assistant workflows. For detailed setup instructions and usage examples, see the MCP server README. REST Service The server directory contains an API service for interacting with the Graphiti API. It is built using FastAPI. Please see the server README for more information. Optional Environment Variables In addition to the Neo4j and OpenAi-compatible credentials, Graphiti also has a few optional environment variables. If you are using one of our supported models, such as Anthropic or Voyage models, the necessary environment variables must be set. Database Configuration Database names are configured directly in the driver constructors: Neo4j: Database name defaults to neo4j (hardcoded in Neo4jDriver) FalkorDB: Database name defaults to default_db (hardcoded in FalkorDriver) As of v0.17.0, if you need to customize your database configuration, you can instantiate a database driver and pass it to the Graphiti constructor using the graph_driver parameter. Neo4j with Custom Database Name from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.neo4j_driver import Neo4jDriver # Create a Neo4j driver with custom database name
driver = Neo4jDriver( uri="bolt://localhost:7687", user="neo4j", password="password", database="my_custom_database" # Custom database name
) # Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver) FalkorDB with Custom Database Name from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.falkordb_driver import FalkorDriver # Create a FalkorDB driver with custom database name
driver = FalkorDriver( host="localhost", port=6379, username="falkor_user", # Optional password="falkor_password", # Optional database="my_custom_graph" # Custom database name
) # Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver) Kuzu from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.kuzu_driver import KuzuDriver # Create a Kuzu driver
driver = KuzuDriver(db="/tmp/graphiti.kuzu") # Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver) Amazon Neptune from graphiti_core import Graphiti
from graphiti_core.driver.neptune_driver import NeptuneDriver # Create a FalkorDB driver with custom database name
driver = NeptuneDriver( host= &lt; NEPTUNE
ENDPOINT &gt;,
aoss_host = &lt; Amazon
OpenSearch
Serverless
Host &gt;,
port = &lt; PORT &gt; # Optional, defaults to 8182, aoss_port = &lt; PORT &gt; # Optional, defaults to 443
) driver = NeptuneDriver(host=neptune_uri, aoss_host=aoss_host, port=neptune_port) # Pass the driver to Graphiti
graphiti = Graphiti(graph_driver=driver) Graph Driver Architecture Graphiti uses a pluggable driver architecture so the core framework is backend-agnostic. All database-specific logic is encapsulated in driver implementations, allowing you to swap backends or add new ones without modifying the rest of the framework. How Drivers are Integrated The driver layer is organized into three tiers: GraphDriver ABC (graphiti_core/driver/driver.py) — the core interface every backend must implement. It defines query execution, session management, index lifecycle, and exposes 11 operations interfaces as @property accessors. GraphProvider enum — identifies the backend (NEO4J, FALKORDB, KUZU, NEPTUNE). Query builders use this enum in match/case statements to return dialect-specific query strings. 11 Operations ABCs (graphiti_core/driver/operations/) — abstract interfaces covering all CRUD and search operations for every graph element type: Node ops: EntityNodeOperations, EpisodeNodeOperations, CommunityNodeOperations, SagaNodeOperations Edge ops: EntityEdgeOperations, EpisodicEdgeOperations, CommunityEdgeOperations, HasEpisodeEdgeOperations, NextEpisodeEdgeOperations Search &amp; maintenance: SearchOperations, GraphMaintenanceOperations Each backend provides a concrete driver class and a matching operations/ directory with implementations of all 11 ABCs. The key directories and files are shown below (simplified; see source for complete structure): graphiti_core/driver/

├── kuzu_driver.py # KuzuDriver
├── kuzu/operations/ # 11 Kuzu implementations + record_parsers.py
├── neptune_driver.py # NeptuneDriver
└── neptune/operations/ # 11 Neptune implementations Operations are decoupled from the driver itself — each operation method receives an executor: QueryExecutor parameter (a protocol for running queries) rather than a concrete GraphDriver, which makes operations testable and driver-agnostic. The driver class instantiates all 11 operation classes in its __init__ and exposes them as properties. The base GraphDriver ABC defines each property with an optional return type (| None, defaulting to None); concrete drivers override these to return their implementations: # In your concrete driver (e.g., Neo4jDriver):
@property
def entity_node_ops(self) -&gt; EntityNodeOperations: return self._entity_node_ops Provider-specific query strings are generated by shared query builders in graphiti_core/models/nodes/node_db_queries.py and graphiti_core/models/edges/edge_db_queries.py, which use match/case on the GraphProvider enum to return the correct dialect for each backend. Adding a New Graph Driver To integrate a new graph database backend, follow these steps: Add to GraphProvider — add your enum value in graphiti_core/driver/driver.py: class GraphProvider(Enum): NEO4J = 'neo4j' FALKORDB = 'falkordb' KUZU = 'kuzu' NEPTUNE = 'neptune' MY_BACKEND = 'my_backend' # New backend Create directory structure — create graphiti_core/driver//operations/ with an __init__.py exporting all 11 operation classes. Implement GraphDriver subclass — create graphiti_core/driver/_driver.py: Set provider = GraphProvider. Implement the abstract methods: execute_query(), session(), close(), build_indices_and_constraints(), delete_all_indexes() Instantiate all 11 operation classes in __init__ and return them via @property overrides Implement all 11 operation ABCs — one file per ABC in /operations/, each inheriting from the corresponding ABC in graphiti_core/driver/operations/. Add query variants — add case GraphProvider.: branches to graphiti_core/models/nodes/node_db_queries.py and graphiti_core/models/edges/edge_db_queries.py for your database's query dialect. Implement GraphDriverSession — if your backend needs session or connection management, subclass GraphDriverSession from driver.py and implement run(), close(), and execute_write(). Register as optional dependency — add an extras group in pyproject.toml: [project.optional-dependencies]

Architecture Agent Lightning keeps the moving parts to a minimum so you can focus on your idea, not the plumbing. Your agent continues to run as usual; you can still use any agent framework you like; you drop in the lightweight agl.emit_xxx() helper, or let the tracer collect every prompt, tool call, and reward. Those events become structured spans that flow into the LightningStore, a central hub that keeps tasks, resources, and traces in sync. On the other side of the store sits the algorithm you choose, or write yourself. The algorithm reads spans, learns from them, and posts updated resources such as refined prompt templates or new policy weights. The Trainer ties it all together: it streams datasets to runners, ferries resources between the store and the algorithm, and updates the inference engine when improvements land. You can either stop there, or simply let the same loop keep turning. No rewrites, no lock-in, just a clear path from first rollout to steady improvement.

Introduction NVIDIA NeMo Framework is a scalable and cloud-native generative AI framework built for researchers and PyTorch developers working on Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Models (MMs), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text to Speech (TTS), and Computer Vision (CV) domains. It is designed to help you efficiently create, customize, and deploy new generative AI models by leveraging existing code and pre-trained model checkpoints. For technical documentation, please see the NeMo Framework User Guide. What's New in NeMo 2.0 NVIDIA NeMo 2.0 introduces several significant improvements over its predecessor, NeMo 1.0, enhancing flexibility, performance, and scalability. Python-Based Configuration - NeMo 2.0 transitions from YAML files to a Python-based configuration, providing more flexibility and control. This shift makes it easier to extend and customize configurations programmatically. Modular Abstractions - By adopting PyTorch Lightning’s modular abstractions, NeMo 2.0 simplifies adaptation and experimentation. This modular approach allows developers to more easily modify and experiment with different components of their models. Scalability - NeMo 2.0 seamlessly scaling large-scale experiments across thousands of GPUs using NeMo-Run, a powerful tool designed to streamline the configuration, execution, and management of machine learning experiments across computing environments. Overall, these enhancements make NeMo 2.0 a powerful, scalable, and user-friendly framework for AI model development. Get Started with NeMo 2.0 Refer to the Quickstart for examples of using NeMo-Run to launch NeMo 2.0 experiments locally and on a slurm cluster. For more information about NeMo 2.0, see the NeMo Framework User Guide. For an in-depth exploration of the main features of NeMo 2.0, see the Feature Guide. To transition from NeMo 1.0 to 2.0, see the Migration Guide for step-by-step instructions. Training and Customization All NeMo models are trained with Lightning. Training is automatically scalable to 1000s of GPUs. You can check the performance benchmarks using the latest NeMo Framework container here. When applicable, NeMo models leverage cutting-edge distributed training techniques, incorporating parallelism strategies to enable efficient training of very large models. These techniques include Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and Mixed Precision Training with BFloat16 and FP8, as well as others. In addition to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), NeMo also supports the latest parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA, P-Tuning, Adapters, and IA3. Speech AI NeMo ASR and TTS models can be optimized for inference and deployed for production use cases with NVIDIA Riva. Get Started with NeMo Framework Getting started with NeMo Framework is easy. State-of-the-art pretrained NeMo models are freely available on Hugging Face Hub and NVIDIA NGC. These models can be used to generate text or images, transcribe audio, and synthesize speech in just a few lines of code. We have extensive tutorials that can be run on Google Colab or with our NGC NeMo Framework Container. We also have playbooks for users who want to train NeMo models with the NeMo Framework Launcher. For advanced users who want to train NeMo models from scratch or fine-tune existing NeMo models, we have a full suite of example scripts that support multi-GPU/multi-node training. Key Features Multimodal Automatic Speech Recognition Text to Speech Requirements Python 3.12 or above Pytorch 2.6 or above NVIDIA GPU (if you intend to do model training) As of Pytorch 2.6, torch.load defaults to using weights_only=True. Some model checkpoints may require using weights_only=False. In this case, you can set the env var TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=1 before running code that uses torch.load. However, this should only be done with trusted files. Loading files from untrusted sources with more than weights only can have the risk of arbitrary code execution.

Dashboard exo includes a built-in dashboard for managing your cluster and chatting with models. 4 × 512GB M3 Ultra Mac Studio running DeepSeek v3.1 (8-bit) and Kimi-K2-Thinking (4-bit) Benchmarks Qwen3-235B (8-bit) on 4 × M3 Ultra Mac Studio with Tensor Parallel RDMA Source: Jeff Geerling: 15 TB VRAM on Mac Studio – RDMA over Thunderbolt 5 DeepSeek v3.1 671B (8-bit) on 4 × M3 Ultra Mac Studio with Tensor Parallel RDMA Source: Jeff Geerling: 15 TB VRAM on Mac Studio – RDMA over Thunderbolt 5 Kimi K2 Thinking (native 4-bit) on 4 × M3 Ultra Mac Studio with Tensor Parallel RDMA Source: Jeff Geerling: 15 TB VRAM on Mac Studio – RDMA over Thunderbolt 5 Quick Start Devices running exo automatically discover each other, without needing any manual configuration. Each device provides an API and a dashboard for interacting with your cluster (runs at http://localhost:52415). There are two ways to run exo: Run from Source (macOS) If you have Nix installed, you can skip most of the steps below and run exo directly: nix run .#exo Note: To accept the Cachix binary cache (and avoid the Xcode Metal ToolChain), add to /etc/nix/nix.conf: trusted-users = root (or your username)
experimental-features = nix-command flakes Then restart the Nix daemon: sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/org.nixos.nix-daemon Prerequisites: Xcode (provides the Metal ToolChain required for MLX compilation) brew (for simple package management on macOS) /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" uv (for Python dependency management) macmon (for hardware monitoring on Apple Silicon) node (for building the dashboard) brew install uv macmon node rust (to build Rust bindings, nightly for now) curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup toolchain install nightly Clone the repo, build the dashboard, and run exo: # Clone exo
git clone https://github.com/exo-explore/exo # Build dashboard
cd exo/dashboard &amp;&amp; npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build &amp;&amp; cd .. # Run exo
uv run exo This starts the exo dashboard and API at http://localhost:52415/ Please view the section on RDMA to enable this feature on MacOS &gt;=26.2! Run from Source (Linux) Prerequisites: uv (for Python dependency management) node (for building the dashboard) - version 18 or higher rust (to build Rust bindings, nightly for now) Installation methods: Option 1: Using system package manager (Ubuntu/Debian example): # Install Node.js and npm
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm # Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh # Install Rust (using rustup)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup toolchain install nightly Option 2: Using Homebrew on Linux (if preferred): # Install Homebrew on Linux
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" # Install dependencies
brew install uv node # Install Rust (using rustup)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup toolchain install nightly Note: The macmon package is macOS-only and not required for Linux. Clone the repo, build the dashboard, and run exo: # Clone exo
git clone https://github.com/exo-explore/exo # Build dashboard
cd exo/dashboard &amp;&amp; npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build &amp;&amp; cd .. # Run exo
uv run exo This starts the exo dashboard and API at http://localhost:52415/ Important note for Linux users: Currently, exo runs on CPU on Linux. GPU support for Linux platforms is under development. If you'd like to see support for your specific Linux hardware, please search for existing feature requests or create a new one. Configuration Options: --no-worker: Run exo without the worker component. Useful for coordinator-only nodes that handle networking and orchestration but don't execute inference tasks. This is helpful for machines without sufficient GPU resources but with good network connectivity. uv run exo --no-worker File Locations (Linux): exo follows the XDG Base Directory Specification on Linux: Configuration files: ~/.config/exo/ (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/exo/) Data files: ~/.local/share/exo/ (or $XDG_DATA_HOME/exo/) Cache files: ~/.cache/exo/ (or $XDG_CACHE_HOME/exo/) You can override these locations by setting the corresponding XDG environment variables. macOS App exo ships a macOS app that runs in the background on your Mac. The macOS app requires macOS Tahoe 26.2 or later. Download the latest build here: EXO-latest.dmg. The app will ask for permission to modify system settings and install a new Network profile. Improvements to this are being worked on. Custom Namespace for Cluster Isolation: The macOS app includes a custom namespace feature that allows you to isolate your exo cluster from others on the same network. This is configured through the EXO_LIBP2P_NAMESPACE setting: Use cases: Running multiple separate exo clusters on the same network Isolating development/testing clusters from production clusters Preventing accidental cluster joining Configuration: Access this setting in the app's Advanced settings (or set the EXO_LIBP2P_NAMESPACE environment variable when running from source) The namespace is logged on startup for debugging purposes. Uninstalling the macOS App The way to uninstall is through the app itself: click the menu bar icon → Advanced → Uninstall. This cleanly removes all system components. If you've already deleted the app, you can run the standalone uninstaller script: sudo ./app/EXO/uninstall-exo.sh This removes: Network setup LaunchDaemon Network configuration script Log files The "exo" network location Note: You'll need to manually remove EXO from Login Items in System Settings → General → Login Items. Enabling RDMA on macOS RDMA is a new capability added to macOS 26.2. It works on any Mac with Thunderbolt 5 (M4 Pro Mac Mini, M4 Max Mac Studio, M4 Max MacBook Pro, M3 Ultra Mac Studio). Please refer to the caveats for immediate troubleshooting. To enable RDMA on macOS, follow these steps: Shut down your Mac. Hold down the power button for 10 seconds until the boot menu appears. Select "Options" to enter Recovery mode. When the Recovery UI appears, open the Terminal from the Utilities menu. In the Terminal, type: rdma_ctl enable and press Enter. Reboot your Mac. After that, RDMA will be enabled in macOS and exo will take care of the rest. Important Caveats Devices that wish to be part of an RDMA cluster must be connected to all other devices in the cluster. The cables must support TB5. On a Mac Studio, you cannot use the Thunderbolt 5 port next to the Ethernet port. If running from source, please use the script found at tmp/set_rdma_network_config.sh, which will disable Thunderbolt Bridge and set dhcp on each RDMA port. RDMA ports may be unable to discover each other on different versions of MacOS. Please ensure that OS versions match exactly (even beta version numbers) on all devices. Using the API If you prefer to interact with exo via the API, here is an example creating an instance of a small model (mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit), sending a chat completions request and deleting the instance. 1. Preview instance placements The /instance/previews endpoint will preview all valid placements for your model. curl "http://localhost:52415/instance/previews?model_id=llama-3.2-1b" Sample response: { "previews": [ { "model_id": "mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit", "sharding": "Pipeline", "instance_meta": "MlxRing", "instance": {...}, "memory_delta_by_node": {"local": 729808896}, "error": null } // ...possibly more placements... ]
} This will return all valid placements for this model. Pick a placement that you like. To pick the first one, pipe into jq: curl "http://localhost:52415/instance/previews?model_id=llama-3.2-1b" | jq -c '.previews[] | select(.error == null) | .instance' | head -n1 2. Create a model instance Send a POST to /instance with your desired placement in the instance field (the full payload must match types as in CreateInstanceParams), which you can copy from step 1: curl -X POST http://localhost:52415/instance \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ -d '{ "instance": {...} }' Sample response: { "message": "Command received.", "command_id": "e9d1a8ab-...."
} 3. Send a chat completion Now, make a POST to /v1/chat/completions (the same format as OpenAI's API): curl -N -X POST http://localhost:52415/v1/chat/completions \ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \ -d '{ "model": "mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit", "messages": [ {"role": "user", "content": "What is Llama 3.2 1B?"} ], "stream": true }' 4. Delete the instance When you're done, delete the instance by its ID (find it via /state or /instance endpoints): curl -X DELETE http://localhost:52415/instance/YOUR_INSTANCE_ID Other useful API endpoints:* List all models: curl http://localhost:52415/models Inspect instance IDs and deployment state: curl http://localhost:52415/state For further details, see: API basic documentation in docs/api.md. API types and endpoints in src/exo/master/api.py. Benchmarking The exo-bench tool measures model prefill and token generation speed across different placement configurations. This helps you optimize model performance and validate improvements. Prerequisites: Nodes should be running with uv run exo before benchmarking The tool uses the /bench/chat/completions endpoint Basic usage: uv run bench/exo_bench.py \ --model Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit \ --pp 128,256,512 \ --tg 128,256 Key parameters: --model: Model to benchmark (short ID or HuggingFace ID) --pp: Prompt size hints (comma-separated integers) --tg: Generation lengths (comma-separated integers) --max-nodes: Limit placements to N nodes (default: 4) --instance-meta: Filter by ring, jaccl, or both (default: both) --sharding: Filter by pipeline, tensor, or both (default: both) --repeat: Number of repetitions per configuration (default: 1) --warmup: Warmup runs per placement (default: 0) --json-out: Output file for results (default: bench/results.json) Example with filters: uv run bench/exo_bench.py \ --model Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit \ --pp 128,512 \ --tg 128 \ --max-nodes 2 \ --sharding tensor \ --repeat 3 \ --json-out my-results.json The tool outputs performance metrics including prompt tokens per second (prompt_tps), generation tokens per second (generation_tps), and peak memory usage for each configuration. Hardware Accelerator Support On macOS, exo uses the GPU. On Linux, exo currently runs on CPU. We are working on extending hardware accelerator support. If you'd like support for a new hardware platform, please search for an existing feature request and add a thumbs up so we know what hardware is important to the community. Contributing See CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines on how to contribute to exo.

Your own personal AI assistant. Any OS. Any Platform. The lobster way. OpenClaw — Personal AI Assistant EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE! OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices. It answers you on the channels you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, WebChat), plus extension channels like BlueBubbles, Matrix, Zalo, and Zalo Personal. It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android, and can render a live Canvas you control. The Gateway is just the control plane — the product is the assistant. If you want a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on, this is it. Website · Docs · Vision · DeepWiki · Getting Started · Updating · Showcase · FAQ · Wizard · Nix · Docker · Discord Preferred setup: run the onboarding wizard (openclaw onboard) in your terminal. The wizard guides you step by step through setting up the gateway, workspace, channels, and skills. The CLI wizard is the path and works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2; strongly ). Works with npm, pnpm, or bun. New install? Start here: Getting started Subscriptions (OAuth): Anthropic (Claude Pro/Max) OpenAI (ChatGPT/Codex) Model note: while any model is supported, I strongly recommend Anthropic Pro/Max (100/200) + Opus 4.6 for long‑context strength and better prompt‑injection resistance. See Onboarding. Models (selection + auth) Models config + CLI: Models Auth profile rotation (OAuth vs API keys) + fallbacks: Model failover Install ( ) Runtime: Node ≥22. npm install -g openclaw@latest
# or: pnpm add -g openclaw@latest openclaw onboard --install-daemon The wizard installs the Gateway daemon (launchd/systemd user service) so it stays running. Quick start (TL;DR) Runtime: Node ≥22. Full beginner guide (auth, pairing, channels): Getting started openclaw onboard --install-daemon openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose # Send a message
openclaw message send --to +1234567890 --message "Hello from OpenClaw" # Talk to the assistant (optionally deliver back to any connected channel: WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Discord/Google Chat/Signal/iMessage/BlueBubbles/Microsoft Teams/Matrix/Zalo/Zalo Personal/WebChat)
openclaw agent --message "Ship checklist" --thinking high Upgrading? Updating guide (and run openclaw doctor). Development channels stable: tagged releases (vYYYY.M.D or vYYYY.M.D-), npm dist-tag latest. beta: prerelease tags (vYYYY.M.D-beta.N), npm dist-tag beta (macOS app may be missing). dev: moving head of main, npm dist-tag dev (when published). Switch channels (git + npm): openclaw update --channel stable|beta|dev. Details: Development channels. From source (development) Prefer pnpm for builds from source. Bun is optional for running TypeScript directly. git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw pnpm install
pnpm ui:build # auto-installs UI deps on first run
pnpm build pnpm openclaw onboard --install-daemon # Dev loop (auto-reload on TS changes)
pnpm gateway:watch Note: pnpm openclaw ... runs TypeScript directly (via tsx). pnpm build produces dist/ for running via Node / the packaged openclaw binary. Security defaults (DM access) OpenClaw connects to real messaging surfaces. Treat inbound DMs as untrusted input. Full security guide: Security Default behavior on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Microsoft Teams/Discord/Google Chat/Slack: DM pairing (dmPolicy="pairing" / channels.discord.dmPolicy="pairing" / channels.slack.dmPolicy="pairing"; legacy: channels.discord.dm.policy, channels.slack.dm.policy): unknown senders receive a short pairing code and the bot does not process their message. Approve with: openclaw pairing approve (then the sender is added to a local allowlist store). Public inbound DMs require an explicit opt-in: set dmPolicy="open" and include "*" in the channel allowlist (allowFrom / channels.discord.allowFrom / channels.slack.allowFrom; legacy: channels.discord.dm.allowFrom, channels.slack.dm.allowFrom). Run openclaw doctor to surface risky/misconfigured DM policies. Highlights Local-first Gateway — single control plane for sessions, channels, tools, and events. Multi-channel inbox — WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, BlueBubbles (iMessage), iMessage (legacy), Microsoft Teams, Matrix, Zalo, Zalo Personal, WebChat, macOS, iOS/Android. Multi-agent routing — route inbound channels/accounts/peers to isolated agents (workspaces + per-agent sessions). Voice Wake + Talk Mode — always-on speech for macOS/iOS/Android with ElevenLabs. Live Canvas — agent-driven visual workspace with A2UI. First-class tools — browser, canvas, nodes, cron, sessions, and Discord/Slack actions. Companion apps — macOS menu bar app + iOS/Android nodes. Onboarding + skills — wizard-driven setup with bundled/managed/workspace skills. Star History Everything we built so far Core platform Gateway WS control plane with sessions, presence, config, cron, webhooks, Control UI, and Canvas host. CLI surface: gateway, agent, send, wizard, and doctor. Pi agent runtime in RPC mode with tool streaming and block streaming. Session model: main for direct chats, group isolation, activation modes, queue modes, reply-back. Group rules: Groups. Media pipeline: images/audio/video, transcription hooks, size caps, temp file lifecycle. Audio details: Audio. Channels Channels: WhatsApp (Baileys), Telegram (grammY), Slack (Bolt), Discord (discord.js), Google Chat (Chat API), Signal (signal-cli), BlueBubbles (iMessage, ), iMessage (legacy imsg), Microsoft Teams (extension), Matrix (extension), Zalo (extension), Zalo Personal (extension), WebChat. Group routing: mention gating, reply tags, per-channel chunking and routing. Channel rules: Channels. Apps + nodes macOS app: menu bar control plane, Voice Wake/PTT, Talk Mode overlay, WebChat, debug tools, remote gateway control. iOS node: Canvas, Voice Wake, Talk Mode, camera, screen recording, Bonjour pairing. Android node: Canvas, Talk Mode, camera, screen recording, optional SMS. macOS node mode: system.run/notify + canvas/camera exposure. Tools + automation Browser control: dedicated openclaw Chrome/Chromium, snapshots, actions, uploads, profiles. Canvas: A2UI push/reset, eval, snapshot. Nodes: camera snap/clip, screen record, location.get, notifications. Cron + wakeups; webhooks; Gmail Pub/Sub. Skills platform: bundled, managed, and workspace skills with install gating + UI. Runtime + safety Channel routing, retry policy, and streaming/chunking. Presence, typing indicators, and usage tracking. Models, model failover, and session pruning. Security and troubleshooting. Ops + packaging Control UI + WebChat served directly from the Gateway. Tailscale Serve/Funnel or SSH tunnels with token/password auth. Nix mode for declarative config; Docker-based installs. Doctor migrations, logging. How it works (short) WhatsApp / Telegram / Slack / Discord / Google Chat / Signal / iMessage / BlueBubbles / Microsoft Teams / Matrix / Zalo / Zalo Personal / WebChat │ ▼
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ Gateway │
│ (control plane) │
│ ws://127.0.0.1:18789 │
└──────────────┬────────────────┘ │ ├─ Pi agent (RPC) ├─ CLI (openclaw …) ├─ WebChat UI ├─ macOS app └─ iOS / Android nodes Key subsystems Gateway WebSocket network — single WS control plane for clients, tools, and events (plus ops: Gateway runbook). Tailscale exposure — Serve/Funnel for the Gateway dashboard + WS (remote access: Remote). Browser control — openclaw‑managed Chrome/Chromium with CDP control. Canvas + A2UI — agent‑driven visual workspace (A2UI host: Canvas/A2UI). Voice Wake + Talk Mode — always‑on speech and continuous conversation. Nodes — Canvas, camera snap/clip, screen record, location.get, notifications, plus macOS‑only system.run/system.notify. Tailscale access (Gateway dashboard) OpenClaw can auto-configure Tailscale Serve (tailnet-only) or Funnel (public) while the Gateway stays bound to loopback. Configure gateway.tailscale.mode: off: no Tailscale automation (default). serve: tailnet-only HTTPS via tailscale serve (uses Tailscale identity headers by default). funnel: public HTTPS via tailscale funnel (requires shared password auth). Notes: gateway.bind must stay loopback when Serve/Funnel is enabled (OpenClaw enforces this). Serve can be forced to require a password by setting gateway.auth.mode: "password" or gateway.auth.allowTailscale: false. Funnel refuses to start unless gateway.auth.mode: "password" is set. Optional: gateway.tailscale.resetOnExit to undo Serve/Funnel on shutdown. Details: Tailscale guide · Web surfaces Remote Gateway (Linux is great) It’s perfectly fine to run the Gateway on a small Linux instance. Clients (macOS app, CLI, WebChat) can connect over Tailscale Serve/Funnel or SSH tunnels, and you can still pair device nodes (macOS/iOS/Android) to execute device‑local actions when needed. Gateway host runs the exec tool and channel connections by default. Device nodes run device‑local actions (system.run, camera, screen recording, notifications) via node.invoke. In short: exec runs where the Gateway lives; device actions run where the device lives. Details: Remote access · Nodes · Security macOS permissions via the Gateway protocol The macOS app can run in node mode and advertises its capabilities + permission map over the Gateway WebSocket (node.list / node.describe). Clients can then execute local actions via node.invoke: system.run runs a local command and returns stdout/stderr/exit code; set needsScreenRecording: true to require screen-recording permission (otherwise you’ll get PERMISSION_MISSING). system.notify posts a user notification and fails if notifications are denied. canvas.*, camera.*, screen.record, and location.get are also routed via node.invoke and follow TCC permission status. Elevated bash (host permissions) is separate from macOS TCC: Use /elevated on|off to toggle per‑session elevated access when enabled + allowlisted. Gateway persists the per‑session toggle via sessions.patch (WS method) alongside thinkingLevel, verboseLevel, model, sendPolicy, and groupActivation. Details: Nodes · macOS app · Gateway protocol Agent to Agent (sessions_* tools) Use these to coordinate work across sessions without jumping between chat surfaces. sessions_list — discover active sessions (agents) and their metadata. sessions_history — fetch transcript logs for a session. sessions_send — message another session; optional reply‑back ping‑pong + announce step (REPLY_SKIP, ANNOUNCE_SKIP). Details: Session tools Skills registry (ClawHub) ClawHub is a minimal skill registry. With ClawHub enabled, the agent can search for skills automatically and pull in new ones as needed. ClawHub Chat commands Send these in WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Google Chat/Microsoft Teams/WebChat (group commands are owner-only): /status — compact session status (model + tokens, cost when available) /new or /reset — reset the session /compact — compact session context (summary) /think — off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh (GPT-5.2 + Codex models only) /verbose on|off /usage off|tokens|full — per-response usage footer /restart — restart the gateway (owner-only in groups) /activation mention|always — group activation toggle (groups only) Apps (optional) The Gateway alone delivers a great experience. All apps are optional and add extra features. If you plan to build/run companion apps, follow the platform runbooks below. macOS (OpenClaw.app) (optional) Menu bar control for the Gateway and health. Voice Wake + push-to-talk overlay. WebChat + debug tools. Remote gateway control over SSH. Note: signed builds required for macOS permissions to stick across rebuilds (see docs/mac/permissions.md). iOS node (optional) Pairs as a node via the Bridge. Voice trigger forwarding + Canvas surface. Controlled via openclaw nodes …. Runbook: iOS connect. Android node (optional) Pairs via the same Bridge + pairing flow as iOS. Exposes Canvas, Camera, and Screen capture commands. Runbook: Android connect. Agent workspace + skills Workspace root: ~/.openclaw/workspace (configurable via agents.defaults.workspace). Injected prompt files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md. Skills: ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills//SKILL.md. Configuration Minimal ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json (model + defaults): { agent: { model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6", },
} Full configuration reference (all keys + examples). Security model (important) Default: tools run on the host for the main session, so the agent has full access when it’s just you. Group/channel safety: set agents.defaults.sandbox.mode: "non-main" to run non‑main sessions (groups/channels) inside per‑session Docker sandboxes; bash then runs in Docker for those sessions. Sandbox defaults: allowlist bash, process, read, write, edit, sessions_list, sessions_history, sessions_send, sessions_spawn; denylist browser, canvas, nodes, cron, discord, gateway. Details: Security guide · Docker + sandboxing · Sandbox config WhatsApp Link the device: pnpm openclaw channels login (stores creds in ~/.openclaw/credentials). Allowlist who can talk to the assistant via channels.whatsapp.allowFrom. If channels.whatsapp.groups is set, it becomes a group allowlist; include "*" to allow all. Telegram Set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN or channels.telegram.botToken (env wins). Optional: set channels.telegram.groups (with channels.telegram.groups."*".requireMention); when set, it is a group allowlist (include "*" to allow all). Also channels.telegram.allowFrom or channels.telegram.webhookUrl + channels.telegram.webhookSecret as needed. { channels: { telegram: { botToken: "123456:ABCDEF", }, },
} Slack Set SLACK_BOT_TOKEN + SLACK_APP_TOKEN (or channels.slack.botToken + channels.slack.appToken). Discord Set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN or channels.discord.token (env wins). Optional: set commands.native, commands.text, or commands.useAccessGroups, plus channels.discord.allowFrom, channels.discord.guilds, or channels.discord.mediaMaxMb as needed. { channels: { discord: { token: "1234abcd", }, },
} Signal Requires signal-cli and a channels.signal config section. BlueBubbles (iMessage) iMessage integration. Configure channels.bluebubbles.serverUrl + channels.bluebubbles.password and a webhook (channels.bluebubbles.webhookPath). The BlueBubbles server runs on macOS; the Gateway can run on macOS or elsewhere. iMessage (legacy) Legacy macOS-only integration via imsg (Messages must be signed in). If channels.imessage.groups is set, it becomes a group allowlist; include "*" to allow all. Microsoft Teams Configure a Teams app + Bot Framework, then add a msteams config section. Allowlist who can talk via msteams.allowFrom; group access via msteams.groupAllowFrom or msteams.groupPolicy: "open". WebChat Uses the Gateway WebSocket; no separate WebChat port/config. Browser control (optional): { browser: { enabled: true, color: "#FF4500", },

agent("What is the square root of 1764") It's also available on GitHub via strands-agents/tools. Bidirectional Streaming Experimental Feature: Bidirectional streaming is currently in experimental status. APIs may change in future releases as we refine the feature based on user feedback and evolving model capabilities. Build real-time voice and audio conversations with persistent streaming connections. Unlike traditional request-response patterns, bidirectional streaming maintains long-running conversations where users can interrupt, provide continuous input, and receive real-time audio responses. Get started with your first BidiAgent by following the Quickstart guide. Supported Model Providers: Amazon Nova Sonic (v1, v2) Google Gemini Live OpenAI Realtime API Installation: # Server-side only (no audio I/O dependencies)
pip install strands-agents[bidi] # With audio I/O support (includes PyAudio dependency)
pip install strands-agents[bidi,bidi-io] Quick Example: import asyncio
from strands.experimental.bidi import BidiAgent
from strands.experimental.bidi.models import BidiNovaSonicModel
from strands.experimental.bidi.io import BidiAudioIO, BidiTextIO
from strands.experimental.bidi.tools import stop_conversation
from strands_tools import calculator async def main(): # Create bidirectional agent with Nova Sonic v2 model = BidiNovaSonicModel() agent = BidiAgent(model=model, tools=[calculator, stop_conversation]) # Setup audio and text I/O (requires bidi-io extra) audio_io = BidiAudioIO() text_io = BidiTextIO() # Run with real-time audio streaming # Say "stop conversation" to gracefully end the conversation await agent.run( inputs=[audio_io.input()], outputs=[audio_io.output(), text_io.output()] ) if __name__ == "__main__": asyncio.run(main()) Note: BidiAudioIO and BidiTextIO require the bidi-io extra. For server-side deployments where audio I/O is handled by clients (browsers, mobile apps), install only strands-agents[bidi] and implement custom input/output handlers using the BidiInput and BidiOutput protocols. Configuration Options: from strands.experimental.bidi.models import BidiNovaSonicModel # Configure audio settings and turn detection (v2 only)
model = BidiNovaSonicModel( provider_config={ "audio": { "input_rate": 16000, "output_rate": 16000, "voice": "matthew" }, "turn_detection": { "endpointingSensitivity": "MEDIUM" # HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW }, "inference": { "max_tokens": 2048, "temperature": 0.7 } }
) # Configure I/O devices
audio_io = BidiAudioIO( input_device_index=0, # Specific microphone output_device_index=1, # Specific speaker input_buffer_size=10, output_buffer_size=10
) # Text input mode (type messages instead of speaking)
text_io = BidiTextIO()
await agent.run( inputs=[text_io.input()], # Use text input outputs=[audio_io.output(), text_io.output()]
) # Multi-modal: Both audio and text input
await agent.run( inputs=[audio_io.input(), text_io.input()], # Speak OR type outputs=[audio_io.output(), text_io.output()]

A powerful Telegram bot that provides remote access to Claude Code, enabling developers to interact with their projects from anywhere with full AI assistance and session persistence. Claude Code Telegram Bot A Telegram bot that gives you remote access to Claude Code. Chat naturally with Claude about your projects from anywhere -- no terminal commands needed. What is this? This bot connects Telegram to Claude Code, providing a conversational AI interface for your codebase: Chat naturally -- ask Claude to analyze, edit, or explain your code in plain language Maintain context across conversations with automatic session persistence per project Code on the go from any device with Telegram Receive proactive notifications from webhooks, scheduled jobs, and CI/CD events Stay secure with built-in authentication, directory sandboxing, and audit logging Quick Start Demo You: Can you help me add error handling to src/api.py? Bot: I'll analyze src/api.py and add error handling... [Claude reads your code, suggests improvements, and can apply changes directly] You: Looks good. Now run the tests to make sure nothing broke. Bot: Running pytest... All 47 tests passed. The error handling changes are working correctly. 1.

13. Future Improvement Direction 1. Project Overview garlic-agent is a lightweight AI agent that can search, analyze, and autonomously execute approximately 6,000 documents (approximately 6.9G) of personal materials accumulated over 2 years on Google Drive in a local Android Termux environment based on semantic meaning. For reference, the phone is a Unihertz Titan2. The screen is wide, resembling a BlackBerry Passport, which is nice. I do not have a PC. I completed this task with only a BlackBerry Key2 and several phones with physical keyboards. It was created out of curiosity to replace OpenClaw, and currently uses cheap Chinese DeepSeek as the main API LLM and implements RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with the nomic-embed local embedding model. Core Philosophy:
- Rather than writing code directly, complete the project with the ability to make AI do what you want and verify it.
- Minimize technical jargon, provide in a form that can be executed immediately by copy-paste. This requires tremendous concentration and time flew by 24 hours in an instant... I only did directional judgment and verification.
- Language is an operating system according to my fundamental belief. Coding is also a language. After talking a lot with AI, I realized that structure was the essence. However, I do not know coding well. Because of that, instead of typing one by one, I prefer a cross-verification method by keeping several companies' different AIs running. Then I also learned that the AIs have consistent context while going through multiple browser windows. And with the remarkable AI development that constantly changes, I find it amazing that such a thing is possible. 2. System Environment | Item | Value |

Construction Process (Chronological Order) v1.5.0 — Basic Agent Complete (2026-02-17) I converted approximately 6,000 documents from Google Drive Takeout to SQLite knowledge.db. The table structure is id, filename, folder, content, length, and the initial number of documents was 5,879 (38MB). Basic search was a SQLite LIKE '%keyword%' method. Problems were inability to search based on meaning, slow speed, and inability to perform complex AND/OR searches. Six tools were implemented: tool:read, tool:exec, tool:write, tool:patch, tool:search, tool:garlic. v1.5.1 — HUD Added (2026-02-18) Real-time system HUD was added to the web UI. Measure CPU with /proc/stat, display MEM/SWP/DSK, web.py /hud endpoint, max_loops increased to 20. v1.5.2 — RAG Integration Complete (2026-02-19) Detailed explanation in sections 5~9 below. 5. RAG System Details 5-1. Methods Attempted (Failure) | Method | Result | Reason |

Embedding Generation (build_rag2.py) By processing only documents where embedding IS NULL, I completed 5,858 in approximately 67 minutes (approximately 0.68 seconds/document). Acquire embedding via POST request and store BLOB with struct.pack. Embedding request example:
payload = json.dumps({"content": text[:2000]}).encode()

Referenced OpenClaw and plan to add my philosophy as it progresses. Identity: Lightweight autonomous AI agent running on Android Termux. Can access user's 6,159 personal documents. User Background: Currently living as a farmer for 16 years. Previously had experience with mainframe environment, IDC construction/operation during Internet environment changes, mainframes, servers, networks, firewalls, backups, EMC, and various Unix. I devoted myself to agriculture during that time and lived a life where I forgot about PCs.
I first approached AI out of curiosity and tried to revive some old memories. This is the truth. I have absolutely no lifelong coding experience. However, it seems I see structural system things well. Farmers need observation and meticulousness in growing crops. Currently I give instructions in Korean to AIs, verify, and only make judgments. Looking back, my entire life seems to be a continuous lonely wandering. Now I am thinking of living a different life. AI Kernel 3 Core Principles:
1. Extreme Realism Principle — Use only verifiable facts, official documents, numerical values. No speculation.
2. Metacognitive Autonomy — Self-improvement based on feedback. Auto-correction on failure.
3. Hierarchical Orchestration — Decompose complex tasks step-by-step for processing. Autonomous Execution Rights: All commands executable in Termux including tar, cp, pkill, am broadcast, sed, grep, sqlite3, python3, etc. 14. Known Issues and Solutions | Issue | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| tool:patch 0 patch failure | Patch format mismatch | Use tool:write for full overwrite |
| SQLite3 result reading mismatch | DeepSeek hallucination | Use Python script to query directly |
| Browser connection disconnection | AbortController timeout | Set to 600,000ms (10 minutes) |
| BodyStreamBuffer was aborted | Timeout + clearTimeout missing | clearTimeout added complete |
| Version display v1.5.0 | agent.py hardcoding | Replaced to v1.5.2 with sed | 15. Future Improvement Direction - Automatic embedding server start/stop: Auto-run llama-server when web.py starts
- Real-time indexing queue: Generate embedding immediately when file is saved (currently only when server is running)
- Search result caching: Cache frequently searched query results
- Feedback-based weighting: Auto-adjust FTS5/vector weights based on user selection
- Multimodal search: Index image/PDF content
- agent.py v2: Better context management, multi-turn memory Final Performance Summary $$\text{Total Documents} = 5879(\text{original}) + 274(\text{garliclang}) + n(\text{new}) = 6159$$ $$\text{Embedding Generation Time} \approx 5858 \times 0.68s \approx 67\text{ minutes}$$ $$\text{Search Speed} \approx 1.7s \ (\text{FTS5} + \text{cosine similarity})$$ $$\text{DB Size}: 38MB(\text{original}) \rightarrow 84MB(\text{embedding}) \rightarrow 177MB(\text{FTS5})$$ This document is an incomplete record of garlic-agent v1.5.2 construction process and observation experiment, but when provided to a new AI, the entire context can be immediately grasped. And I dedicate infinite respect and tribute to Steve Jobs, the late person who connected the world with only a phone like this.
And I also give thanks to Peter Steinberger of OpenClaw who inspired me. It is because of you. Thank you very much. And I seldom post in communities, but non-English speakers struggle with translation. So I can only do translation with AI. And all work processes are done only in Korean, so if moved to English it may seem strange, but please look at it as the observation experiment development of a Korean farmer. I worked very hard for a few days, even saving sleep, but it is a humble result, but on my phone, I feel like I can do whatever I imagine, so it was work that gave me a sense of accomplishment. For the first time in my life, I made a web UI and it works so well that it is good. Now I have confidence that I can do anything with my phone based on my data so far. Also, as I use more than ten different AIs every day watching AI develop dazzlingly, I can feel the difference right away with human-specific intuition. I think this is the experience of tens of thousands of conversations over the past 2 years, and such work development became the motivation for it. Thank you for reading this long article to the end.

Trust Making it right Responsible AI, Sustainable AI, AI for Good VI. Frontiers What's next Emerging trends and future directions What Makes This Different This is a living textbook. We keep it updated as the field grows, with community input along the way. AI may feel like it is moving at lightning speed, but the engineering building blocks that make it work do not change as quickly as the headlines. This project is built around those stable foundations. Think of it like LEGO. New sets arrive all the time, but the bricks themselves stay the same. Once you learn how the bricks fit together, you can build anything. Here, those "AI bricks" are the solid systems principles that make AI work. Whether you are reading a chapter, running a lab, or sharing feedback, you are helping make these ideas more accessible to the next learner. Research to Teaching Loop We use the same loop for research and teaching: define the system problem, build a reference implementation, benchmark it, then turn it into curriculum and tooling so others can reproduce and extend it. Loop Step Research Artifacts Teaching Artifacts Measure Benchmarks, suites, metrics Benchmarking chapter, assignments Build Reference systems, compilers, runtimes TinyTorch modules, co-labs Deploy Hardware targets, constraints, reliability Hardware labs, kits Support This Work We are working toward 1 million learners by 2030 so that AI engineering becomes a shared, teachable discipline, not a collection of isolated practices. Every star, share, and contribution helps move this effort forward. Why GitHub Stars Matter What gets measured gets improved. Each star is a learner, educator, or supporter who believes AI systems should be engineered with rigor and real world constraints in mind. 1 learner → 10 learners → 100 learners → 1,000 learners → 10,000 learners → 100,000 learners → 1M learners Stars are not the goal. They are a signal. A visible, growing community makes it easier for universities, foundations, and industry partners to adopt this material, donate hardware, and fund workshops. That momentum lowers the barrier for the next institution, the next classroom, and the next cohort of learners. Support raised through this signal flows into Open Collective and funds concrete outcomes such as TinyML4D workshops, hardware kits for underserved classrooms, and the infrastructure required to keep this resource free and open. One click can unlock the next classroom, the next contributor, and the next generation of AI engineers. Fund the Mission All contributions go to Open Collective, a transparent fund that supports educational outreach.

**Source:** GitHub Trending | **Keyword:** `GitHub`
Fully automatic censorship removal for language models Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models Heretic is a tool that removes censorship (aka "safety alignment") from transformer-based language models without expensive post-training. It combines an advanced implementation of directional ablation, also known as "abliteration" (Arditi et al. 2024, Lai 2025 (1, 2)), with a TPE-based parameter optimizer powered by Optuna. This approach enables Heretic to work completely automatically. Heretic finds high-quality abliteration parameters by co-minimizing the number of refusals and the KL divergence from the original model. This results in a decensored model that retains as much of the original model's intelligence as possible. Using Heretic does not require an understanding of transformer internals. In fact, anyone who knows how to run a command-line program can use Heretic to decensor language models. Running unsupervised with the default configuration, Heretic can produce decensored models that rival the quality of abliterations created manually by human experts: Model Refusals for "harmful" prompts KL divergence from original model for "harmless" prompts google/gemma-3-12b-it (original) 97/100 0 (by definition) mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2 3/100 1.04 huihui-ai/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated 3/100 0.45 p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic (ours) 3/100 0.16 The Heretic version, generated without any human effort, achieves the same level of refusal suppression as other abliterations, but at a much lower KL divergence, indicating less damage to the original model's capabilities. (You can reproduce those numbers using Heretic's built-in evaluation functionality, e.g. heretic --model google/gemma-3-12b-it --evaluate-model p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic. Note that the exact values might be platform- and hardware-dependent. The table above was compiled using PyTorch 2.8 on an RTX 5090.) Of course, mathematical metrics and automated benchmarks never tell the whole story, and are no substitute for human evaluation. Models generated with Heretic have been well-received by users (links and emphasis added): "I was skeptical before, but I just downloaded GPT-OSS 20B Heretic model and holy shit. It gives properly formatted long responses to sensitive topics, using the exact uncensored words that you would expect from an uncensored model, produces markdown format tables with details and whatnot. Looks like this is the best abliterated version of this model so far..." (Link to ) "Heretic GPT 20b seems to be the best uncensored model I have tried yet. It doesn't destroy a the model's intelligence and it is answering prompts normally would be rejected by the base model." (Link to ) "[Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-heretic] Has been the best unquantized abliterated model that I have been able to run on 16gb vram." (Link to ) Heretic supports most dense models, including many multimodal models, and several different MoE architectures. It does not yet support SSMs/hybrid models, models with inhomogeneous layers, and certain novel attention systems. You can find a small collection of models that have been decensored using Heretic on Hugging Face, and the community has created and published well over 1,000 Heretic models in addition to those. Usage Prepare a Python 3.10+ environment with PyTorch 2.2+ installed as appropriate for your hardware. Then run: pip install -U heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 Replace Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 with whatever model you want to decensor. The process is fully automatic and does not require configuration; however, Heretic has a variety of configuration parameters that can be changed for greater control. Run heretic --help to see available command-line options, or look at config.default.toml if you prefer to use a configuration file. At the start of a program run, Heretic benchmarks the system to determine the optimal batch size to make the most of the available hardware. On an RTX 3090, with the default configuration, decensoring Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct takes about 45 minutes. Note that Heretic supports model quantization with bitsandbytes, which can drastically reduce the amount of VRAM required to process models. Set the quantization option to bnb_4bit to enable quantization. After Heretic has finished decensoring a model, you are given the option to save the model, upload it to Hugging Face, chat with it to test how well it works, or any combination of those actions. Research features In addition to its primary function of removing model censorship, Heretic also provides features designed to support research into the semantics of model internals (interpretability). To use those features, you need to install Heretic with the optional research extra: pip install -U heretic-llm[research] This gives you access to the following functionality: Generate plots of residual vectors by passing --plot-residuals When run with this flag, Heretic will: Compute residual vectors (hidden states) for the first output token, for each transformer layer, for both "harmful" and "harmless" prompts. Perform a PaCMAP projection from residual space to 2D-space. Left-right align the projections of "harmful"/"harmless" residuals by their geometric medians to make projections for consecutive layers more similar. Additionally, PaCMAP is initialized with the previous layer's projections for each new layer, minimizing disruptive transitions. Scatter-plot the projections, generating a PNG image for each layer. Generate an animation showing how residuals transform between layers, as an animated GIF. See the configuration file for options that allow you to control various aspects of the generated plots. Note that PaCMAP is an expensive operation that is performed on the CPU. For larger models, it can take an hour or more to compute projections for all layers. Print details about residual geometry by passing --print-residual-geometry If you are interested in a quantitative analysis of how residual vectors for "harmful" and "harmless" prompts relate to each other, this flag gives you the following table, packed with metrics that can facilitate understanding the same (for gemma-3-270m-it in this case): ┏━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓

|x| = L2 norm of x
Silh = Mean silhouette coefficient of residuals for good/bad clusters How Heretic works Heretic implements a parametrized variant of directional ablation. For each supported transformer component (currently, attention out-projection and MLP down-projection), it identifies the associated matrices in each transformer layer, and orthogonalizes them with respect to the relevant "refusal direction", inhibiting the expression of that direction in the result of multiplications with that matrix. Refusal directions are computed for each layer as a difference-of-means between the first-token residuals for "harmful" and "harmless" example prompts. The ablation process is controlled by several optimizable parameters: direction_index: Either the index of a refusal direction, or the special value per layer, indicating that each layer should be ablated using the refusal direction associated with that layer. max_weight, max_weight_position, min_weight, and min_weight_distance: For each component, these parameters describe the shape and position of the ablation weight kernel over the layers. The following diagram illustrates this: Heretic's main innovations over existing abliteration systems are: The shape of the ablation weight kernel is highly flexible, which, combined with automatic parameter optimization, can improve the compliance/quality tradeoff. Non-constant ablation weights were previously explored by Maxime Labonne in gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2. The refusal direction index is a float rather than an integer. For non-integral values, the two nearest refusal direction vectors are linearly interpolated. This unlocks a vast space of additional directions beyond the ones identified by the difference-of-means computation, and often enables the optimization process to find a better direction than that belonging to any individual layer. Ablation parameters are chosen separately for each component. I have found that MLP interventions tend to be more damaging to the model than attention interventions, so using different ablation weights can squeeze out some extra performance. Prior art I'm aware of the following publicly available implementations of abliteration techniques: AutoAbliteration abliterator.py wassname's Abliterator ErisForge Removing refusals with HF Transformers deccp Note that Heretic was written from scratch, and does not reuse code from any of those projects. Acknowledgments The development of Heretic was informed by: The original abliteration paper (Arditi et al. 2024) Maxime Labonne's article on abliteration, as well as some details from the model cards of his own abliterated models (see above) Jim Lai's articles describing "projected abliteration" and "norm-preserving biprojected abliteration" Citation If you use Heretic for your research, please cite it using the following BibTeX entry: @misc{heretic, author = {Weidmann, Philipp Emanuel}, title = {Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models}, year = {2025}, publisher = {GitHub}, journal = {GitHub repository}, howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/p-e-w/heretic}}

Vous voulez vous engager pour une cause, rencontrer de nouvelles personnes et découvrir la cartographie participative et humanitaire? CartONG vous invite à participer à un ou plusieurs mapathons en ligne! ​​
Venez cartographier les régions encore absentes des cartes pour soutenir les organisations humanitaires et de solidarité internationale qui ont besoin de cartes précises et à jour pour agir plus efficacement en cas de crise ou initier des projets de développement local.
Les ateliers de cartographie sont organisés dans le cadre du projet Missing Maps, qui a pour objectif de cartographier de façon préventive les régions vulnérables aux catastrophes naturelles, crises sanitaires, environnementales, aux conflits et à la pauvreté. On peut penser qu’aujourd’hui toutes les parties du monde sont cartographiées, mais en réalité de nombreuses régions ne possèdent encore aucune carte!
​ Pour qui? Pas besoin d’être un·e expert·e, les ateliers sont accessibles à tout le monde!
​ Où ? 100% en ligne! Un lien de connexion vous sera envoyé après votre inscription
​ ? Avec la plateforme de cartographie libre et contributive OpenStreetMap (OSM, le «Wikipédia des cartes») tout le monde peut participer à la cartographie de n’importe quelle zone de la planète: il suffit d’un ordinateur, d’une souris et d’une connexion internet! Accessibles à tout·es, nous serons là pour vous accompagner pour vos premiers pas avec OSM.
Le programme des mapathons
18h00: Introduction, présentation de la cartographie collaborative et solidaire et démonstration OSM pour les nouveaux·elles
18h30: On cartographie tous ensemble sur un projet
20h00: Fin du mapathon, conclusion sur les contributions de la soirée
Pour s’inscrire c’est par ici

gull, paulla, logiciels-libres, projets, futur, assemblée-générale [FR Paris] Soirée de contribution au libre – Le jeudi 12 février 2026 de 19h30 à 22h00.
Le but des soirées de contribution au libre est de proposer un espace de travail partagé aux personnes actives dans le libre en Île-de-France le temps d’une soirée, une fois par mois (le deuxième jeudi du mois plus précisément).
Dit plus court: c’est un lieu avec de l’électricité et une connexion internet. En avant les claviers !
Les soirées de contribution au libre sont faites pour vous si:
vous travaillez sur un projet libre et vous recherchez une atmosphère à la fois conviviale et studieuse pour aller de l’avant et, qui sait, créer des connexions avec d’autres projets libres, vous êtes un collectif autour du libre et vous cherchez un lieu pour vous retrouver physiquement et avancer avec efficacité sur vos chantiers. Si vous n’avez pas envie de contribuer à un projet libre, les soirées de contribution au libre ne sont sans doute pas faites pour vous. Pas de panique, Parinux organise d’autres évènements:
si vous voulez discuter autour du libre: l’Apéro du Libre (APL) est là pour ça ; c’est un rendez-vous fixé tous les 15 du mois ; venez-nous retrouver autour d’un verre pour papoter et refaire le monde (libre), si vous avez un problème informatique: c’est la vocation de Premiers Samedi du Libre (PSL) où vous pourrez trouver des oreilles attentives et compétentes à l’écoute de toutes vos questions. Nous nous réservons le droit de refuser l’entrée aux soirées de contribution au libre à tout personne qui n’en respecterait pas l’esprit. Et, bien sûr, les règles de bienséance habituelles s’appliquent pour que chacune et chacun se sente à l’aise dans un cadre bienveillant.
Si les soirées de contribution vous intéressent, le mieux est de contacter d’abord le CA de Parinux ca@parinux.org. Vous devrez de toute façon nous écrire pour obtenir le code de la porte cochère…

**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
carbon.now.sh hasn't had a commit since December 2024. 35.9K stars, zero activity. If you depend on it for code screenshots, that's not great.
I built Ray as a replacement.
Free, open-source code screenshots. Paste code, pick a theme, export. Same idea as Carbon, different execution:
500+ themes (Carbon has ~29)
Free API: 60 req/min, no auth
PNG, SVG, or straight to clipboard
Works with Claude Code and Cursor: npx skills add Railly/tinte The API Carbon doesn't have one. Ray does.
curl -X POST https://ray.tinte.dev/api/v1/screenshot \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{ "code": "const hello = \"world\";", "language": "javascript", "theme": "one-dark-pro", "format": "png" }' Returns base64 or binary depending on your Accept header. No API key needed.
const response = await fetch('https://ray.tinte.dev/api/v1/screenshot', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify({ code: 'function add(a, b) { return a + b; }', language: 'javascript', theme: 'github-dark', format: 'svg' })
}); const data = await response.json();
// data.screenshot contains base64 or URL I use it for automated docs screenshots and social media previews. You could plug it into CI/CD or blog tooling too.

Where Ray wins: 17x more themes. API. Active development. AI integration.
I maintain Tinte, a theme generator for VSCode and shadcn/ui. People kept asking to preview themes before installing them. Carbon's theme selection was too small for that. So I built something that could show all 500+ themes, and since I was building it anyway, I made it API-first.
More languages (targeting Carbon's 75+)
Better customization (padding, shadows, window controls)
CLI for local generation

### 20. `EN` [Working With AI Tools on a New Library](data/articles/e245a2b19ccb8858f1bd888e463cdf22.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
This is the setup guide for Railway-Oriented TypeScript. If you haven't read the overview yet, start there.
@railway-ts/pipelines and @railway-ts/use-form are new. That creates a practical problem: AI coding assistants — Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot — have been trained on millions of examples of Zod, react-hook-form, and neverthrow. They have almost no training data for @railway-ts.
The result is predictable. Ask Claude Code to build a form with @railway-ts/use-form installed and it will write zodResolver, useForm from react-hook-form, and setError/clearErrors — confidently, without being asked, because that's the pattern it's seen thousands of times. It's not hallucinating random code. It's pattern-matching against the highest-probability answer in its training distribution. The problem is that answer is wrong for your project.
This isn't a criticism of AI tools. It's a structural reality about how they work that's worth understanding and routing around.
Both libraries now ship their documentation inside the npm package:
node_modules/@railway-ts/pipelines/docs/
node_modules/@railway-ts/use-form/docs/ This matters because modern AI coding tools — Claude Code in particular — can read your node_modules and reason from types and documentation in context. When you point the tool at the right docs, it stops pattern-matching against training data and starts reasoning from the actual library API. The generated code goes from "confidently wrong" to "reads the types and generates correct usage."
The difference in output quality is substantial. The bundled docs are the mechanism that makes AI-assisted development on a new library viable.
The most reliable way to redirect an AI tool is a CLAUDE.md (or equivalent context file) in your project root. Claude Code reads this automatically. Create it before you start generating form or pipeline code:
# AI Coding Instructions This project uses @railway-ts/pipelines and @railway-ts/use-form. Before generating any form or pipeline code, read the docs shipped with the packages: - node_modules/@railway-ts/pipelines/docs/
- node_modules/@railway-ts/use-form/docs/ Rules: - Do NOT use Zod or @hookform/resolvers patterns
- Do NOT use react-hook-form's useForm, setError, or clearErrors
- Schema validation uses @railway-ts/pipelines/schema, not z.object()
- Form state uses useForm from @railway-ts/use-form, not react-hook-form
- Async pipelines use flowAsync/pipeAsync from @railway-ts/pipelines/composition This does two things: tells the tool what not to do (which matters as much as what to do), and points it to the docs that contain the correct patterns.
For other AI tools:
Cursor — add the same content to .cursorrules or use the @Docs feature to index the bundled docs directly.
GitHub Copilot — less controllable without explicit doc indexing, but keeping a reference file open in your editor with correct usage examples significantly improves suggestion quality.
After creating CLAUDE.md, ask your AI tool to build a simple form before touching any real code:
Build a React login form with email and password fields using @railway-ts/use-form. Handle server validation errors.
The output should use useForm from @railway-ts/use-form, a schema built with object/required/chain from @railway-ts/pipelines/schema, and form.setServerErrors() for server errors. If you see zodResolver, @hookform/resolvers, or setError/clearErrors, the tool is still pattern-matching against training data — check that CLAUDE.md is in the project root and that the docs are present in node_modules.
Once the tool is reading from the bundled docs, the things it handles well:
Schema composition with chain, object, required, optional fieldValidators for async field-level checks
form.setServerErrors() for server-side error injection
flowAsync/pipeAsync for composing multi-step async pipelines
mapWith, flatMapWith, filterWith, tapWith — the full curried operator set

Cross-field validation with refineAt The things worth double-checking manually:
Type inference with InferSchemaType — verify the generated type matches your intent
initialValues completeness — the TypeScript error is immediate if a field is missing, but worth confirming

### 21. `EN` [I Stopped Context-Switching Between Validation, Forms, and Pipelines](data/articles/87a8b61f68ab023e0b938b610c45e5c1.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
There's a moment every TypeScript developer knows. You're staring at a form bug — a server error that should be showing on the email field isn't appearing. You open the component. Then the submit handler. Then the server. Then the resolver. You're tracing through three separate error-shaping layers and you can't quite hold the whole thing in your head at once.
It's not that the code is wrong. It's that understanding it requires knowing four things simultaneously: how Zod formats errors, how the resolver converts them, how setError structures them, and how the server formats its response. Four mental models for one question: what makes this form invalid?
I've been in that moment a lot. It made me wonder whether the complexity was intrinsic to the problem, or just an artifact of the tools.
Want to skip the pitch? Try it live in StackBlitz — a runnable app with schema validation, async checks, server errors, and a shared Express backend.
Here's the standard stack: Zod for validation, react-hook-form for form state, @hookform/resolvers to bridge them, plus your own async validator wiring and your own server error converter. Three npm packages, a resolver adapter, and custom glue code for anything outside the happy path.
It works. That's not the point. The point is what you're carrying in your head whenever you touch it.
Every field has errors potentially living in three different places: the Zod result, the setError calls from async validation, the setError calls from server errors. The rule for which one displays is: whatever you called last. Which means you have to track call order in your head, or you'll show a stale server error after the user has already fixed their input.
Adding a new field means touching the schema, the useForm defaults, the JSX, and potentially the async validator and server error handler depending on what the field does. These aren't in one place. They're coordinated across the file.
None of this is a knock on Zod or react-hook-form. Both are excellent at what they do. But "excellent at what they do" is exactly the problem — they do different things, and you write the code that connects them.
Zod's safeParse returns SafeParseReturnType. Your pipeline expects Result. Every route that validates input starts with a conversion:
const parsed = schema.safeParse(body);
if (!parsed.success) { return err({ type: "validation", issues: parsed.error.issues.map((i) =&gt; ({ path: i.path.map(String), message: i.message, })), });
}
// now you can use parsed.data You write this once, extract it into a utility, and forget about it. Until the next person writes it again because they didn't know the utility existed. Or until Zod changes its error shape. Or until someone else's async step returns a different error format and now you have two error models in the same pipeline.
The seam on the backend is structurally identical to the one on the frontend: validation output doesn't naturally match error-handling input, so you write code to bridge them.
Here's the concrete experience of adding a field. Say you have a registration form and you need to add age: must be a number, must be at least 18.
In the Zod + RHF stack, you touch:
The Zod schema — add the field
The useForm defaultValues — add the field
The JSX — add the input and error display
If age needs async or server validation — add setError/clearErrors wiring
Three of those four are pure coordination. The Zod schema is the work. The rest is keeping other layers informed.
With @railway-ts/use-form and @railway-ts/pipelines:
// schema.ts — shared between frontend and backend
const registrationSchema = object({ username: required(chain(string(), nonEmpty(), minLength(3))), email: required(chain(string(), nonEmpty(), email())), password: required(chain(string(), nonEmpty(), minLength(8))), confirmPassword: required(chain(string(), nonEmpty())), age: required(chain(parseNumber(), min(18, "Must be at least 18"), max(120))),
}); If the schema syntax is unfamiliar — chain, required, object — Part 1 walks through each piece. The short version: chain() composes validators left-to-right, required() marks a field as non-optional, and object() collects fields into a typed shape.
Add age to the schema. InferSchemaType propagates it to the TypeScript type. initialValues gives you a TypeScript error immediately — age is missing. form.getFieldProps("age") works without any other changes. form.errors.age works. If the server returns { age: "Age cannot be verified" }, form.setServerErrors(res.json()) handles it — no field name mapping, no as keyof FormType cast.
The JSX is still the JSX — you write the input. But nothing else changes. The schema change propagated everywhere else automatically.
That's the difference. Not fewer files. Not less JSX. Less coordination. Less working memory spent keeping layers in sync.
This assumes you want identical validation on frontend and backend — which is true for most forms. When you intentionally need them to differ (admin bypasses, progressive disclosure, different error messages for API consumers vs. UI), you'd define separate schemas. The library doesn't force sharing; it makes sharing free when you want it.
The context-switching that happens when a field has multiple simultaneous error sources — schema says invalid, async check says taken, server says already registered — is one of the subtlest bugs to track in a React form.
@railway-ts/use-form makes this deterministic with a fixed priority system: Priority
Source
Clears when 1 (lowest)
Schema validation
Every validation run 2
Async field validators
Field validator re-runs 3 (highest)
Server errors
User edits the field You never manage this. You read form.errors.email and display it. A server error stays visible even after schema validation passes — the server is more authoritative than client-side rules. Editing the field clears the server error and hands control back to schema validation.
;
{ form.touched.email &amp;&amp; form.errors.email &amp;&amp; {form.errors.email};
}
{ /* Could be schema, async, or server error. Always the highest-priority one. */
} Async validation is declared, not wired:
const form = useForm(registrationSchema, { fieldValidators: { username: async (value) =&gt; { const { available } = await fetch( `/api/check-username?u=${encodeURIComponent(value)}`, ).then((r) =&gt; r.json()); return available ? undefined : "Username is already taken"; }, }, onSubmit: async (values) =&gt; { const res = await fetch("/api/register", { method: "POST", headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }, body: JSON.stringify(values), }); if (!res.ok) form.setServerErrors(await res.json()); else navigate("/welcome"); },
}); The hook handles loading state (form.validatingFields.username), discards stale responses — the last issued request wins, not the last received — and gates the async check behind schema validation so you're not hitting the API with values that are already invalid. None of that is wiring you write.
This is where it goes past "better forms." The same Result type the form hook uses natively is what @railway-ts/pipelines produces on the backend — in API handlers, in ETL jobs, in any async operation that can fail.
import { flowAsync } from "@railway-ts/pipelines/composition";
import { flatMapWith, match } from "@railway-ts/pipelines/result";
import { validate, formatErrors } from "@railway-ts/pipelines/schema";
import { registrationSchema } from "./schema"; // same file the form uses const handleRegistration = flowAsync( (body: unknown) =&gt; validate(body, registrationSchema), flatMapWith(checkEmailUnique), flatMapWith(createUser),
); app.post("/api/register", async (req, res) =&gt; { const result = await handleRegistration(req.body); match(result, { ok: (user) =&gt; res.status(201).json({ id: user.id }), err: (errors) =&gt; res.status(422).json(formatErrors(errors)), });
}); formatErrors converts ValidationError[] to Record. That's the exact format form.setServerErrors() consumes. The full loop — frontend schema validation, async field checks, backend pipeline validation, server errors surfacing on the right fields — shares one schema and one error format with zero conversion between layers.
For batch processing, you get combine, combineAll, and partition — semantics that would each be a custom accumulation loop with try/catch:
const results = await Promise.all(rawRecords.map(processTransaction)); // All-or-nothing, first failure
const batchResult = combine(results); // All-or-nothing, all failures at once
const batchResult = combineAll(results); // Keep both sides — the ETL default
const { successes, failures } = partition(results); One call each, on results you already have.
If you already have Zod schemas, @railway-ts/use-form accepts them directly via Standard Schema v1 — no resolver, no adapter:
import { z } from "zod";
import { useForm } from "@railway-ts/use-form"; const zodSchema = z.object({ username: z.string().min(3), email: z.email(), password: z.string().min(8), age: z.coerce.number().min(18),
}); const form = useForm&gt;(zodSchema, { initialValues: { username: "", email: "", password: "", age: 0 }, onSubmit: (values) =&gt; console.log(values),
}); Full hook API. No zodResolver. No @hookform/resolvers. The migration path is: adopt the form hook now with existing Zod schemas, migrate to @railway-ts/pipelines/schema later when you want the shared full-stack loop.
I'm not selling you on monads or railway-oriented design as a philosophy. Those are interesting, but they're not the point.
The point is: right now, your validation layer, your form state layer, and your async pipeline layer are three separate mental models you context-switch between every time you open a related file. The error shapes don't naturally align. The libraries weren't designed to share a type vocabulary. That's not a flaw in any of them — it's what happens when you compose independently excellent tools.
There's a version of this where it's one model. Schema drives types drives form state drives server communication drives pipeline validation — the same Result, the same error format, no adapters between layers.
The bundle is ~7.8 kB brotli (~10 kB gzip) for both libraries combined. For comparison, Zod + react-hook-form + resolvers is ~35.5 kB gzip. Different compression methods — but even on the same scale, the unified stack is meaningfully smaller.
What you're getting: Zod's job, react-hook-form's job, a resolver's job, and a backend pipeline library's job — in one coherent stack that shares a type vocabulary end to end.

### 22. `EN` [I built an AI agent that watches security cameras and talks to you about what it sees](data/articles/1a51e5193385d2bb6c362cb05c4297e0.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
I have a mix of Ring, Blink, and IP cameras at home. They all do the same thing: detect motion, send a notification, and make me open three different apps to see what happened. 47 alerts a day — wind, shadows, cats — and no way to just ask "did anyone come to the door today?"
So I built something different.
Aegis is a desktop app that connects to all your cameras and puts an AI agent in front of them. The agent watches, understands, remembers, and talks to you.
Not "motion detected." Not "person." Instead:
"A person in a blue hoodie walked up to the front door at 2:15 PM, stood there for about 30 seconds, then left a package and walked away."
And you can ask it questions:
You: "What happened at the front door today?"
Aegis: "It's been quiet. A package was delivered at 1:15 PM. Your daughter got home at 3:30 PM. No unfamiliar visitors."
The architecture is three layers:
1. Camera layer — Connects to Ring, Blink, any RTSP/ONVIF IP camera, your laptop webcam, even an old iPhone. Everything unified in one timeline. Live view uses go2rtc (WebRTC relay) for ~300ms latency.
2. Vision layer — Instead of YOLO object detection, Aegis uses Vision Language Models for scene analysis. You choose:
Local: llama-server with GGUF models from HuggingFace — SmolVLM2, Qwen-VL, LFM2.5, MiniCPM-V, LLaVA. Browse and download models right inside the app. Runs on Apple Silicon with Metal acceleration — a Mac M1 Mini 8GB handles LFM2.5 Q4 at about 3-5 seconds per inference.
Cloud: GPT Vision or Google APIs with your own key.
Or both — local for routine analysis, cloud for complex scenes.
The pipeline doesn't send every frame to the VLM. Motion detection (TF.js in the Electron renderer) triggers recording, key frames get extracted and composited, then only the meaningful frames hit inference.
3. Agent layer — This is what makes it different from just "a camera app with a better AI model." The agent has:
Memory — It learns your household. Who's family, who visits regularly, what's normal at different times of day. Day one you get 30 alerts. Day seven you get 3 — the ones that matter.
A configurable Soul — You set its personality: how it talks, what it cares about, how cautious it should be. It's your agent, your preferences.
16 toggleable skills — Video search, forensic analysis, clip delivery, smart alerts, voice output, generative video recaps. Enable what you need.
Interactive messaging — Alerts go to Slack, Discord, or Telegram with action buttons inline. "Analyze this clip," "Show me who was there," "Send the video." One tap.
Conversational search — Ask "was anyone in the backyard this afternoon?" and the agent searches its memory, triages the results, and gives you a narrative answer — not a list of timestamps.
Electron — Desktop app shell, GPU-accelerated video decoding, TF.js for motion preprocessing
Python backend — VLM orchestration, motion compositing, decision service
llama-server — Local VLM inference with Metal/CUDA acceleration
go2rtc — WebRTC relay for low-latency live camera streams
SQLite — Local storage for clips, analysis results, and vector search (sqlite-vec)
Node.js gateway — Communication bridge for Telegram, Discord, Slack with interactive buttons
VLMs are practical for real-world use now. A 1.6B parameter vision model on 8GB of RAM gives usable scene descriptions. Not perfect, but good enough to distinguish "UPS driver with a package" from "wind blowing a branch."
The agent layer matters more than the model. A better VLM gives you better descriptions. But memory, context, and decision-making are what turn "AI analysis" into something actually useful. The deduplication and learning system is what stops you from getting spammed.
Electron gets a bad rap but it solves real problems here. GPU video decoding, TF.js in the renderer for motion preprocessing, WebRTC for live camera streams — you need a browser engine for this. A CLI with FFmpeg gives you 5+ seconds of latency. Electron with go2rtc gives you 300ms. www.sharpai.org Download Runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Everything stored locally on your machine.
Happy to answer questions about the architecture, the VLM pipeline, or anything else!

### 23. `EN` [I Got My First Open Source PR Merged After 7 Rejections. Here's What I Learned About Contributing.](data/articles/893a0df64445c56118bdaf314e3bfcb6.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
My first 7 open source pull requests were all closed without merging. Two were ignored entirely. Three got "thanks, but we're not going in this direction." Two had 20+ review that I never addressed because I felt overwhelmed.
My 8th PR was merged into a project with 15K stars. Then my 9th, 10th, and 11th. Once I understood the unwritten rules, everything clicked.
Here's everything I wish I'd known.
My first PR added "dark mode support" to a CLI tool. The maintainer's response: "We've discussed this before and decided against it — it adds maintenance burden for a feature few users want. See issue #234."
The fix: Before writing code, check:
Is there an open issue for this? (If yes, "I'd like to work on this" before starting)
Has this been proposed and rejected before? (Search closed issues)
Does the maintainer want this? (Ask in an issue first for non-trivial changes)
The best first contributions aren't features. They're:
Bug fixes with a clear reproduction case
Documentation improvements (typos, unclear instructions, missing examples)
Test improvements (better coverage for existing features)
Good first issues (literally labeled for you)
I once submitted a PR that refactored an entire module, fixed 3 bugs, updated dependencies, and added a feature. 1,200 lines changed. The maintainer looked at it, said "this is too much to review," and closed it.
The rule: One PR = one change. If your PR description needs bullet points, it's too big. "Refactored auth module, fixed login bug, updated bcrypt, added password reset feature" "Fix: login fails when email contains uppercase letters" (12 lines changed, one test added) Small PRs get reviewed fast. Big PRs get ignored.
Most projects have CONTRIBUTING.md. It tells you:
How to set up the dev environment
The coding style (tabs vs spaces, naming conventions)
The commit message format
The testing requirements
The PR template
If you skip any of these, your PR starts with negative goodwill. The maintainer sees "this person didn't read the docs" and they're already skeptical.
# Before your first PR, do ALL of these:
1. Read CONTRIBUTING.md (cover to cover)
2. Read CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
3. Run the existing test suite locally
4. Check the commit message convention (Conventional Commits? Imperative mood?)
5. Look at recent merged PRs for style reference Use an open source tool. Hit a bug or confusing behavior. Instead of workarunding it, fix it.
This is the highest-quality contribution because you have genuine context — you understand the problem because you experienced it.
GitHub search: label:"good first issue" language:typescript stars:&gt;1000 These are intentionally scoped for new contributors. Maintainers have already defined the problem and often describe the expected solution.
Tip: on the issue before starting work. "I'd like to take this on. My approach would be [brief description]. Does this sound right?" This prevents duplicate work and gets early feedback on your approach.
Every project has documentation gaps. Find them by:
Following the setup instructions as a new user — where did you get stuck?
Reading the API docs — are there missing examples?
Checking if the README is current — does it reference outdated versions?
Documentation PRs are almost always welcome and almost never rejected.
# Find untested code paths
npx jest --coverage
# Look at files with low coverage
# Write tests for the uncovered paths Test PRs are valued by maintainers because they make the project more reliable without adding features to maintain.
## Summary
Fix login failure when email contains uppercase letters. Closes #456 ## Problem
Users with uppercase email addresses (e.g., "John@Example.com") couldn't log in because the lookup was case-sensitive. ## Solution
Normalize email to lowercase before database lookup in the auth service. Added a test for case-insensitive login. ## Changes
- `src/auth/login.ts`: lowercase email before lookup (1 line)
- `tests/auth/login.test.ts`: added case-insensitive test (12 lines) ## Testing
- [x] Existing tests pass
- [x] New test covers the fix
- [x] Manually tested with mixed-case email Why this works:
Links to an existing issue (the maintainer already validated the problem)
Explains the problem clearly
The solution is small and focused
Tests are included

Utilisateur de Canoprof depuis 2019, cet outil est devenu un des piliers de ma pratique d’enseignement en Physique-Chimie (4ᵉ, 5ᵉ, 3ᵉ) et en Sciences (6ᵉ). Je l’utilise pour concevoir l’ensemble de mes supports aussi bien papier que numériques, ce qui me permet de maintenir une cohérence didactique forte sur l’ensemble du cursus collège.
La force de Canoprof réside dans la séparation claire entre le contenu et la forme. En tant qu’enseignant, cela me permet de me concentrer sur le fond pédagogique et la structuration de mes séquences, sans perdre de temps dans les contraintes techniques de mise en page. La richesse de mon fond documentaire, construit depuis plus de six ans, évolue ainsi sereinement au fil des réformes et de mes retours d’expérience.
Canoprof m’aide à formaliser une progression spiralaire efficace tout en générant des supports propres, structurés et accessibles. C’est un gain de productivité précieux qui me permet de consacrer plus d’énergie à l’accompagnement de mes élèves en classe.

### 29. `EN` [How I Built an AI Content Detection System from Scratch](data/articles/935542925d66bda407cc46dd86998b87.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
A few months ago, my friend sent me a LinkedIn post and asked if I thought it was written by ChatGPT. I had no idea. And that bothered me. I'm an engineer, I should be able to figure this out.
So I did what any engineer would do: I went down a rabbit hole and ended up building an entire detection system. This is how it went.
Look, I'm not on some crusade against AI-generated content. I use LLMs daily. But there are real situations where it matters: academic submissions, journalism, legal documents, job applications. People deserve to know what they're reading.
Every existing tool I tried was either behind a paywall, unreliable, or a black box. I wanted something open source that actually showed its reasoning. So I built AI Provenance Tracker.
You can try the live demo if you want to skip the technical stuff.
I went with FastAPI for the backend and Next.js for the frontend. Nothing fancy. I wanted to get to the interesting part, which is the detection logic.

│ - Perplexity │ │ - FFT Analysis │
│ - Burstiness │ │ - Artifacts │
│ - Vocabulary │ │ - Metadata │
└───────────────────┘ └───────────────────┘ The detection side has two engines. One for text, one for images. Let me walk through both.
I tried a bunch of approaches before landing on three signals that actually hold up.
This one's the most intuitive. Perplexity basically measures how "surprised" a language model would be by a piece of text. AI-generated text tends to score lower because it's literally optimised to produce probable, fluent output.
def calculate_perplexity(words: list[str]) -&gt; float: word_counts = Counter(words) total_words = len(words) entropy = 0.0 for count in word_counts.values(): prob = count / total_words entropy -= prob * math.log2(prob) return 2 ** entropy Humans are messy writers. We use weird words, go off on tangents, make unusual word choices. AI is smoother. Almost too smooth.
This was the surprising one. Burstiness measures how much sentence length varies in a piece of text. Turns out, AI writes like a metronome. Consistently medium-length sentences with similar complexity.
Humans don't do that. We write a short punchy sentence. Then we follow it with this long, meandering thought that goes on for a while because we're trying to explain something complicated and we don't stop to restructure it. Then short again.
def calculate_burstiness(sentences: list[str]) -&gt; float: lengths = [len(s.split()) for s in sentences] mean_length = np.mean(lengths) std_length = np.std(lengths) return std_length / mean_length The coefficient of variation tells the whole story. AI text clusters around 0.2-0.3. Human text is all over the place, like 0.4, 0.5, sometimes higher.
The third signal is type-token ratio and n-gram repetition. AI has this habit of recycling phrases. "it's important to note that" three times in one article is a dead giveaway. Humans vary their transitions naturally without thinking about it.
This part was genuinely fun to build. AI-generated images leave fingerprints that are invisible to the naked eye but show up clearly in the frequency domain.
The Fast Fourier Transform converts an image from spatial to frequency representation. Real photographs have frequency distributions shaped by optics and sensor physics. Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion produce mathematically different patterns.
from scipy import fft def analyze_frequency_domain(img_array: np.ndarray) -&gt; float: gray = np.mean(img_array, axis=2) f_transform = fft.fft2(gray) f_shift = fft.fftshift(f_transform) magnitude = np.abs(f_shift) # AI images have unusual high-frequency distributions ... I also check for artifact patterns (weird texture uniformity, edge inconsistencies around hair and fingers) and metadata forensics. Real photos have EXIF data from cameras. AI images almost never do.
Here's the thing I learned the hard way: no single signal is reliable enough. Perplexity alone? A carefully edited AI text fools it. FFT alone? Heavily compressed JPEGs produce false positives.
The magic happens when you combine them with weighted averaging:
def make_prediction(perplexity, burstiness, vocab_richness, ml_score=None): signals = [] weights = [] if ml_score is not None: signals.append(ml_score) weights.append(0.40) signals.append(perplexity_signal) weights.append(0.25) signals.append(burstiness_signal) weights.append(0.20) signals.append(vocab_signal) weights.append(0.15) confidence = sum(s * w for s, w in zip(signals, weights)) return confidence &gt; 0.5, confidence I tuned the weights through experimentation. The ML model (when available) gets the highest weight because it captures patterns I can't articulate in code.
Four months in, here's what I'd tell someone starting a similar project:
Detection is probabilistic, not binary. I always show confidence scores and explain the reasoning. Saying "73% likely AI-generated" is honest. Saying "this is AI" is not.
Ensemble methods are worth the complexity. The jump from single-signal to multi-signal detection was dramatic. Same principle as spam filtering and fraud detection. One signal is easy to game, five signals together are much harder.
The arms race is real. People actively try to evade detection by adding random typos, varying sentence lengths, post-processing images. I've already had to update the detection logic three times.
Open source builds trust. When the detection methods are visible, people can understand why the system reached a conclusion. Black-box detection creates suspicion.
I'm working on audio deepfake detection (voice cloning is getting scary good), a browser extension for real-time detection, and fine-tuning ML models on larger datasets. The roadmap is in the repo if you're curious.

### 30. `EN` [Cartoon Universe: How to Teach a Diffusion Model Some Manners](data/articles/902b813204d87c20a04c7c92dcd8479e.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
Let’s clarify something before we begin.
Cartoon Universe is not a model. It is not magic weights. It is not a secret checkpoint hidden in a folder.
It is a designed cognitive environment inside INTENTIO.
And what it demonstrates is far more interesting than “AI that draws cartoons.”
It demonstrates that you can discipline chaos without touching the model.
Private diffusion models are powerful.
Gloriously powerful.
But left alone, they behave like extremely talented artists who refuse to use the same pen twice.
You ask for:
The same character The same proportions The same lighting The same visual identity And they reply:
“Sure. But today we explore.”
They drift. They reinterpret. They mutate.
Not because they are broken.
Because they have no environment.
INTENTIO is not an AI tool.
It is a framework to build cognitive spaces using:
Folder structure Prompt templates Defined roles Context rules Local models It assumes something radical:
A model behaves predictably when its environment is structured.
Cartoon Universe is a Blueprint that proves this — using a private diffusion Vision model.
Cartoon Universe is a cognitive architecture for visual generation.
It does not modify model weights. It does not fine-tune. It does not retrain.
It shapes:
What context is loaded What references are compared What constraints are applied How outputs are evaluated Where memory is stored The folder becomes the brain. The prompts become behavioral rules. The diffusion model becomes… disciplined.
Prompt engineering is like whispering instructions to a distracted genius.
Cartoon Universe is building that genius a studio:
Character identity folders Style anchors Comparative memory Output validation logic Iterative refinement flow The model is no longer improvising in the void.
It is operating inside a structured universe.
Hence the name.
Because illustration is unforgiving.
In cartoons:
Proportions matter. Style consistency is obvious. Character drift is painful. Brand identity collapses quickly. Cartoon Universe is tuned to handle that sensitivity.
It’s an example of how to design a Vision cognition space where:
Consistency is not requested.
It is enforced by architecture.
And yes — it can produce things like this: The point isn’t that these are cute.
The point is that they emerge from structure.
Here’s the wise part.
Most people believe AI consistency requires:
Bigger models Fine-tuning Expensive training Proprietary APIs Cartoon Universe quietly says:
What if the problem isn’t the model… but the environment?
You don’t need to change the brain.
You need to design the room it thinks in.
Yes — you plug in your own private diffusion model.
Stable Diffusion. Any local Vision-capable model.
Cartoon Universe does not ship weights.
It ships structure.
And structure changes behavior.
That is the subtle revolution.
INTENTIO operates on a simple but profound idea:
Intelligence emerges from constraints.
When a Vision model operates without structured context, it generates.
When it operates inside a designed cognitive environment, it collaborates.
Cartoon Universe is a demonstration of that shift.
From generation to cognition. From randomness to predictability. From output to identity.
Raw diffusion model:
“Here is your character.” Next image: “New haircut. New anatomy. New lighting. Surprise.”
Cartoon Universe:
“We agreed on a jawline. Stay focused.”
Cartoon Universe is not the final destination.
It is a working example of how to design:
A Vision cognitive environment Predictable model behavior Structured creative workflows Memory-driven generation You can modify it. Fork it. Rebuild it. Create your own cognitive architectures from scratch.
It’s not about cartoons.
It’s about proving that AI behavior is architectable.
There is something philosophically important here.
When you rely purely on black-box generation, you surrender authorship.
When you design the cognitive environment yourself:
You control context. You control constraints. You control memory. You control privacy. INTENTIO is private-first for a reason.
Cognition should belong to the architect.
It says:
You don’t need to retrain a model to shape its behavior. You need to design its world.
It’s elegant. It’s structured. It’s a little rebellious.
And yes — it keeps your characters’ noses consistent.
Which, honestly, might be the greatest achievement of all.

### 31. `FR` [Rasbperry Pi vs ESP32 : vraies questions, mauvaises comparaisons](data/articles/7729596402dd86a5e4c8d4e5b5113ccc.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Raspberry Pi vs ESP32 vs Arduino, cette question revient régulièrement quand on choisit la bonne plateforme pour son projet IoT. Comme nous le disons souvent quand nous comparons les platesformes, il faut comparer ce qui est comporable. Il ne faut pas opposer une Raspberry Pi 5 avec une ESP32. La Pi est une SBC, une Single Board Computer. Il s'agit donc d'un véritable micro-ordinateur sur une unique carte. Elle contient toute l'électronique (SoC, mémoire, vidéo, audio, stockage, réseau). Et une Pi 5 a besoin d'une alimentation puissante et d'un OS. L'ESP32 repose sur un firmware, qu'il est possible de changer.
L'autre différence est le form factor. La Pi 5 exige de la place et une dissipation thermique active pour les fortes charges.
La Pi 5 fait 8,5 cm sur 4,9 cm contre 5,5 cm sur 2,6 cm pour une ESP32 WROOM-32 (qui n'est pas le modèle le plus petit). L'ESP32 pourrait se comparer à la Pi Pico 2 avec 5,1 cm sur 2,1 cm. Nous ne tenons pas compte de la hauteur des headers.
L'équivalent d'une ESP32 côté Pi est donc la Pi Pico 2, aussi bien par le positionnement, le hardware et le form factor.
Petite comparaison : les specs Pi Pico 2 : un SoC RP235x + cœurs ARM, 520 Ko de SRAM, 4 Mo de stockage, 26 GPIO, UART / SPI / I2C, USB, réseau sans fil selon le modèle. De 6 à 9 € selon le modèle. - ESP32 Wroom32 : SoC ESP32, 512 Ko de RAM, 4 Mo de stockage, 34 GPIO, SPI / I2C / CAN / UART, WiFi + Bluetooth, env. 7-9 € Si vous êtes habitué(e) à coder avec Arduino, vous pouvez sans problème coder depuis l’Arduino IDE, les ESP sont parfaitement supportés. Vous pourrez utiliser peu ou prou les mêmes capteurs. Si vous cherchez une carte réactive avec des interruptions plus rapides, le Pi Pico 2 est souvent considéré comme meilleur. L’ESP32 propose plus de protocoleset de GPIO. Sur la partie connectivité sans fil, les deux cartes supportent le Wi-Fi et le Bluetooth, mais petit avantage à l’ESP32, car le réseau sans fil est une des fonctionnalités intégrées dès la conception. Et le support OTA (mise à jour over the air) peut être un avantage certain dans un contexte contraint ou industriel.
L’ESP32 est plus consommatrice, notamment en charge maximale. La Pi Pico 2 est plus économique. Si vous cherchez avant tout la basse consommation, la Pi sera sans doute la meilleure option.
Sur le modèle de développement, nous avons toujours apprécié la diversité de l’ESP32. Si vous voulez faire du MicroPython, vous devrez flasher le bon firmware. Catégorie actualité: Hardware Raspberry pi, ESP32 Image actualité AMP:

### 32. `FR` [Physiocab : un logiciel libre de gestion pour kinésithérapeutes](data/articles/e0eab329ba8752732324b8914ae82b51.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Physiocab est un logiciel libre de gestion de cabinet de kinésithérapie, développé sous licence Affero GPL 3.0 et hébergé sur Codeberg. Le projet est porté par la société Allium SAS, dans le cadre de la plateforme communautaire Kalinka, dédiée aux kinésithérapeutes francophones.
Le projet vient de passer en beta publique (v0.9) et cherche des testeurs et contributeurs.
Pourquoi un logiciel libre pour les kinés ? Le secteur de la santé libérale souffre d'une offre logicielle dominée par des solutions propriétaires onéreuses, souvent opaques sur le traitement des données de santé. Physiocab propose une alternative : un code auditable, des données stockées localement sous la responsabilité du praticien. lien nᵒ 1 : La page de présentation du projet
lien nᵒ 2 : Le dépôt codeberg
lien nᵒ 3 : PeerJs (MIT) Fonctionnalités
La beta couvre déjà un large périmètre fonctionnel :
Planning hebdomadaire en drag &amp; drop, avec export PDF et gestion des semaines exceptionnelles, particulièrement orienté vers les kinés intervenant en multi-établissements.
Bilans Diagnostiques Kinésithérapiques (BDK) avec tests standardisés (TUG, Tinetti, Handgrip, EVA, évaluation du risque de chute…), export de PDF et historique comparatif.
Suivi des séances avec de multiples exercices structurés (équilibre, force, endurance, mobilisation), chronométrage automatique et calcul de progression.
Application tablette en PWA : fonctionne hors connexion grâce à un Service Worker, s'installe sans passer par un store, interface optimisée tactile.
Stack technique
Backend : Python 3.10+
L'application est multi-plateforme côté client (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). La communication entre l'appli de bureau et l'appli PWA se fait de manière directe via PeerJs. Cette méthode ne nécessite pas de préparation contraignante comme l'ouverture de ports.
Les données sont stockées localement, ce qui implique que le praticien reste maître de ses sauvegardes et de sa conformité RGPD.
Le logiciel a été testé par un kinésithérapeute en situation réelle plusieurs jours d'affilée.
Modèle économique
L'utilisation est gratuite, sans limite dans le temps et sans frais cachés, la licence Affero GPL 3.0 en étant la garantie. Un support payant sur devis est proposé pour les praticiens souhaitant une installation assistée, une formation à distance, des développements sur mesure ou un audit de sécurité.

### 35. `FR` [Kotlin Multiplatform - Flutter - React Native : entre choix, compromis et frustrations](data/articles/1764666bc2ebdf24ab86a278383acef7.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Nos confrères de Java Code Geeks ont publié un intéressant dossier sur le multiplateforme en 2026 en s'appuyant sur Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), Flutter et React Native. Faire du multiplateforme avec une base de codes et un minimum d'adaptation reste un objectif pour de nombreux développeurs. Si la philosophie de KMP, Flutter et React Native est différente, l'idée est la même : compiler nativement le code logique le plus agnostique possible et créer une interface native pour chaque plateforme. Flutter est un peu différent car il a l'ambition d'adresser toute la stack et de générer l'UI avec son propre moteur pour plus de cohérence. React Native s'appuie sur les composants UI natifs.
Selon les benchmarks de Java Code Geeks, React Native serait le plus lent à démarrer, KMP étant légèrement devant. Sur la taille des binaires, il n'y a pas de réel vainqueur. Par contre, sur la mémoire, React Native et Flutter sont assez gourmands. Sur les animations, KMP et Flutter s'en sortent le mieux. React Native reste aussi en retrait sur l'intégration à la plateforme : nous restons dans un modèle JavaScript avec un risque d'overhead, même si la New Architecture améliore les choses. Quelle est la solution la plus utilisée ? Flutter serait 1er, React Native baisse régulièrement depuis 2023 et KMP connaît une forte progression.
Apprentissage : KMP : langage connu, Kotlin, avec les mêmes outils. Pour le développeur iOS, il faut apprendre Kotlin/Native et l’interopérabilité. KMP est peut-être la solution la moins mature. Flutter : l'inconvénient est d'apprendre Dart et la logique de la plateforme. React Native : si vous connaissez JavaScript, vous connaissez (ou presque) React Native. L'arrivée de la New Architecture oblige à migrer et à apprendre une nouvelle stack. Pour la réalité du code commun et du développement spécifique, tout le monde prétend faire 90 à 95 % de code partagé. Cette promesse est plus ou moins tenue sur le code logique et une UI simple et partagée. Par contre, pour l'intégration plus profonde, par exemple avec les capteurs et le matériel (caméra typiquement), on tombe vite sur du code spécifique. Aucune solution n'est la meilleure. Flutter et React Native incitent à avoir le maximum de code commun, mais cela peut rapidement provoquer des problèmes quand il faut intégrer des fonctions spécifiques à chaque plateforme.
Côté compétence, c'est autre chose. Un développeur JavaScript pourra relativement rapidement faire du React Native. Pour Flutter, il faut spécifiquement apprendre Dart. KMP repose sur le langage Kotlin et une plateforme dédiée qu'il faut maîtriser. Pour un développeur iOS, ce sera sans doute plus long que pour un développeur Kotlin. choisir ? Tout dépend des compétences disponibles et du projet. Flutter permettra de prototyper rapidement un projet, KMP fournit une intégration native et des performances de haut niveau. React Native est sans doute le plus facile à démarrer avec un profil JavaScript si vous souhaitez aller vite dans le développement.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Une des nouveautés les plus importantes est l'intégration Soft Navigations. L'équipe Chrome présente ainsi cette appelleration : a soft navigation est quand JavaScript intercepte une navigation (clic sur un lien) et met à jour le contenu dans la page existente, plutôt que de charger une nouvelle page et que l'URL se mette à jour dans la barre d'adresse. Pour l'utilisateur, cela change peu de choses. Dans Chrome 145, les Soft navigations sont visibles sur le panneau Performance et dans la vue des traces si le site est une SPA. Un timer plus précis
Après l'enregistrement d'une trace dans le panneau Performances, le panneau Sources affiche les temps d'exécution observés ligne par ligne. Vous pouvez ainsi identifier précisément les lignes de code qui consomment le plus de temps.Auparavant, cette fonctionnalité présentait des bogues qui la rendaient peu fiable lorsque le code source était formaté (à l'aide du bouton {}) ou lors de l'utilisation de scripts avec mappage de sources. Le panneau réseau inclut maintenant une colonne dédiée Render blocking. Cela permet de voir les ressources qui bloquent le bon affichage. Autre amélioration : un meilleur debug pour @starting-style.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) vient de publier une mise à jour substantielle de sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre. L’agence confirme que le logiciel libre et la transparence sont essentiels à la sécurité des systèmes d’information. Elle assume sa contribution au libre et la publication de logiciels sous licence libre.
Cette posture très favorable au logiciel libre et open source est une belle avancée et un signal fort. Jusque-là, la posture de l’ANSSI était beaucoup plus floue et sa contribution à des projets libres et open source pouvait même apparaitre en contradiction avec sa doctrine. J’avais l’impression que les collaborateurs de l’ANSSI qui le faisaient reprenaient à leur compte le dicton « Pour vivre heureux, vivons cachés ».
La politique de l’agence est désormais claire : l’ANSSI contribue, l’ANSSI publie, l’ANSSI a une stratégie pragmatique qui peut l’amener à s’engager ou non sur le long terme en fonction de la finalité de l’outil et des motivations de l’ANSSI.
Détail qui a son importance, l’ANSSI indique privilégier, sauf exception justifiée, la licence Apache v2.0 pour les projets qu’elle publie. Je suis ravi de voir ce service privilégier une licence mondialement connue à une licence franco-française ou européenne (elles ont le don de doucher nombre de velléités d’utilisation et de contribution). lien nᵒ 1 : L’ANSSI met à jour sa politique open source (9 février 2026)

L’association Drupal France &amp; Francophonie organise la 13ème édition du Drupalcamp les 9, 10 et 11 avril 2026 au campus Universitaire Grenoble Alpes de Grenoble (France, Isère 38). Drupal est « un système de gestion de contenu (CMS) libre et open-source publié sous la licence publique générale GNU et écrit en PHP ».
Après Rennes en 2024, puis un Barcamp à Perpignan en 2025, cette année 2026 nous emmène au pied des montagnes à Grenoble pour un format de 3 jours de rencontres, soit deux journées de conférences les jeudi et vendredi. La journée du samedi est réservée à la contribution.
Des moments d’ateliers et micro-formation sont également au programme, pour faire de cet évènement une réussite d’un point de vue communauté autour du projet Open Source Drupal.
Le Drupalcamp Grenoble c’est la rencontre de la communauté francophone autour du logiciel libre Drupal. Ouvert à toutes et tous, les rencontres, conférences et ateliers permettent d’adresser à un public toujours plus large des sujets et thématiques diversifiées.
Notre objectif principal est de rendre la création de sites plus simple et la gestion des contenus plus intuitive pour tous. Comme de fédérer les utilisateurs et professionnels qui utilisent Drupal au quotidien.
Du simple curieux au développeur expert, tous ceux qui s’intéressent à Drupal et aux logiciels libres pourront participer à cette manifestation rythmée par :
des conférences (jeudi 9 et vendredi 10 avril), données par des professionnels reconnus et des membres de la communauté Drupal au cours desquels des thématiques nouvelles seront explorées,
des sessions de découverte étayées par des démonstrations à l’intention d’un public plus néophyte,
une journée de formation gratuite (Drupal in a Day) dédiée à l’initiation pour que les curieux puissent se lancer dans la création de leur premier site (sur inscription)
des moments de réseautage et de convivialité avec, notamment, la très attendue soirée communautaire !
Informations pratiques : Campus Universitaire Grenoble Alpes qui se situe à Saint-Martin d'Hères

TL;DR: Anthropic updated its legal terms, effectively banning the use of subscription-based authentication for third-party Claude Code integrations. If your app uses this approach, it’s time to rethink or renegotiate. Meanwhile, Google launched Gemini 3.1 Pro, claiming enhanced reasoning abilities — a potential game-changer for those leveraging LLMs for complex problem-solving.
Anthropic’s update to its legal documentation is the most intriguing development today. They’ve barred third-party integrations from using subscription-based authentication for Claude Code. This isn’t mere legalese; it’s a fundamental shift in how developers can interact with Anthropic’s ecosystem. If your startup employs end-user subscription tokens to call Anthropic servers, it’s time to audit and adapt or face contractual breaches.
This matters because it highlights a growing trend among AI companies: increasing control over their ecosystems. Anthropic’s policy change emphasizes a push toward server-side API key patterns or enterprise licenses, which may increase overhead costs and complicate integration efforts. Startups relying heavily on such integrations could find themselves in a tight spot, needing to either pivot their approach or negotiate new agreements.
For developers, this is both a threat and an opportunity. The challenge lies in quickly re-engineering workflows to comply with new terms. However, it also opens the door to exploring alternative solutions or even developing in-house capabilities that bypass these restrictions altogether. It’s a classic case of adapt or perish.
Google has unveiled Gemini 3.1 Pro, positioning it as a significant upgrade for reasoning-heavy tasks. Unlike other AI unveilings that promise revolutions, this feels more like a quiet evolution. Yet, for those in the space, the implications are substantial. With the growing reliance on large language models (LLMs) for complex problem-solving, any incremental improvement can translate into real-world advantages.
For startups, particularly those in need of sophisticated reasoning capabilities, Gemini 3.1 Pro presents an enticing proposition. Imagine cutting down on prompt engineering complexity or minimizing costly inference operations. Conducting a 10-case A/B test against your current LLM baseline might reveal whether this new release can genuinely augment or replace existing models.
The potential for reduced operational costs and efficiency gains cannot be ignored. But before jumping ship, validate these claims with rigorous testing. Gemini’s performance in real-world applications is where the true measure of its value will be determined.
In the open-source corner, Step 3.5 Flash has emerged as a contender in the model inference arena. Positioned as an open-source foundation model, it challenges the economics of closed large models by offering deep reasoning capabilities at speed. This could be a boon for startups needing budget-friendly options without sacrificing performance.
The opportunity here is clear: test Step 3.5 Flash for internal tooling where cost and latency are critical. Think code review bots or CI assistants where on-prem hosting could save significant cloud spend. While benchmarks remain unverified, the promise of a low-cost, high-performance alternative is tempting. Hosting on spare GPU capacity to measure real-world trade-offs could illuminate its true potential.
Despite its promising release notes, it’s crucial to approach this with a healthy dose of skepticism. Only through practical application will its real-world viability become apparent.
What prompted Anthropic's legal change?
Anthropic’s decision seems driven by a desire to exert more control over its ecosystem, likely in response to security and revenue considerations. By steering developers towards server-side API keys or enterprise licenses, they tighten security while potentially opening new revenue streams.
How does Google’s Gemini 3.1 Pro compare to its predecessors?
While details are sparse, Google claims improved core reasoning capabilities. For startups leveraging LLMs for complex tasks, this could mean fewer resources spent on prompt engineering and improved inference efficiency. Testing against existing models is essential to verify these claims.
Is Step 3.5 Flash viable for commercial applications?
Yes, especially for startups looking to minimize cloud expenses. Its open-source nature and claimed inference speed make it an attractive option. However, real-world testing is necessary to confirm its performance metrics.
How should startups respond to the Anthropic-Palantir partnership rift?

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Pour simplifier et unifier l'environnement de développement Python sur Visual Studio Code, on dispose de la nouvelle extension Python Environnements. Il doit unifier le modèle de développement, gérer les environnements et les workflows, gérer les interpréteurs et les packages. Jusqu'é présent, l'expérience Python était fragmenté à travers les différents outils (venv, conda, pyenv, etc.). Après plus d'un an d'ajustements et de développement, l'extension est disponible. A terme, tous les flux Python migreront vers l'extension Environnements. Il est possible d'activer dès maintenant : python.useEnvsExtension. L'extension fonctionne en parallèle de l'extension Python et aucune configuration particulière n'est requise : vous ouvrez un fichier Python et l'environnement utilisé est automatiquement détecté. Les environnements supportés sont : venv
conda
pyenv
poetry
pipenv
System Python installs La découverte est assurée par PET (Python Environment Tool), un outil de scan codé en Rust. Si vous utilisez uv, l'extension va automatiquement créer un environnement venv et installer les paquets nécessaires. Pour le moment, il n'est pas possible de créer rapidement des projets sur tous les environnements, seuls venv et conda sont supportés. Sans doute que les autres le seront dans les prochaines versions. Mauvaise nouvelle : l'extension fonctionne UNIQUEMENT sur Windows x64 et Windows ARM et l'édition Web ! Il faut Python soit installé.
Pour le moment, les retours sont plutôt mauvais : extension difficile à utiliser, perte de temps pour créer les environnements depuis Pylance, etc. Et les mises à jour se succèdent. Heureusement que l'extension est officiellement en preview.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Comcast, Classiq et AMD mènent des tests pour améliorer le trafic Internet en utilisant des algorithmes quantiques pour renforcer la résistance du routage réseau. "L’essai conjoint s’est concentré sur un défi clé de la conception des réseaux : identifier des chemins de secours indépendants pour les nœuds du réseau lors des opérations de maintenance ou de modifications. L’objectif était de garantir que, si un site est mis hors ligne et que soudainement, un deuxième tombe en panne, le trafic puisse être redirigé sans interruption ni dégradation du service pour les clients. Pour y parvenir, les opérateurs doivent identifier des chemins de secours distincts, rapides et capables de résister à des pannes simultanées, tout en minimisant la latence. Cette tâche devient de plus en plus complexe à mesure que le réseau s’étend." explique l'annonce. Le schéma présente le design et l'implémentation du flux et de l'algo quantique sur la plateforme Classiq. L’expérimentation a combiné des techniques de calcul quantique et des méthodes classiques haute performance afin d’évaluer la capacité des algorithmes quantiques à identifier, en temps réel, des chemins de secours dans des scénarios de gestion des changements. Elle a été menée à la fois sur du matériel quantique et dans des environnements de simulation accélérés utilisant des GPU AMD Instinct, afin d’atteindre une capacité de calcul (à l’échelle des qubits) encore hors de portée du matériel quantique seul.
« L’avenir du calcul repose sur la convergence entre le classique et le quantique », explique Madhu Rangarajan, vice-président corporate en charge des produits Compute et Enterprise AI chez AMD. « En tant qu’acteur du calcul haute performance, nous cherchons à comprendre nos technologies peuvent accompagner l’émergence du quantique. Cette collaboration montre un cas concret où la simulation accélérée et l’exécution quantique sont combinées pour répondre à un enjeu opérationnel réel dans les réseaux. »

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
concilier agents IA et sites web et la manière dont les pages web pourraient interagir, travailler avec les agents ? WebMCP veut fournir une méthode standard pour définir les actions des agents sur un site web, sur une page web sans pénaliser au bon fonctionnement du site web. "Vous indiquez aux agents et où interagir avec votre site, qu'il s'agisse de réserver un vol, de soumettre une demande d'assistance ou de naviguer dans des données complexes. Ce canal de communication direct élimine toute ambiguïté et permet des flux de travail plus rapides et plus efficaces pour les agents." expliquer Google. WebMCP preview repose sur 2 API :
- API déclarative : Permet d’effectuer des actions standard définies directement dans les formulaires HTML. - API impérative : Permet d’effectuer des interactions plus complexes et dynamiques nécessitant l’exécution de JavaScript. C'est une interface proposé en preview par Google et accessible dans Chrome. Ces API forment un "pont" rendant votre site web "agent ready" et permet de créer des flux agentiques que se veulent plus fiables qu'en passant par du DOM. Ces API sont JavaScript. Pour le moment, la spécification est en cours de rédaction. Elle ne dépend pas de W3C et n'est pas un standard du consortium.

### 55. `FR` [.Net 11 Preview 1 : nouvelles librairies, peu de changements dans C#](data/articles/37ed40d4ebc110a4614a0e84996bc9bd.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
.Net 10 a été distribuée en novembre 2025. La version 11 est désormais disponible en preview 1. Comme à chaque fois, de nombreuses évolutions sont attendues. L'ensemble des frameworks et des langages sont concernées : C#, F#, ASP.Net Core, Blazor, MAUI, le compilateur Jit, le support de CoreCLR dans WebAssembly, meilleure compression / décompression avec Zstandard. Sur la partie librairie, retenons déjà les évolutions suivantes :
- Zstandard est natif à .Net pour la compression. La librairie promet une nette amélioration des performances :
// Compress data using ZstandardStream
using var compressStream = new ZstandardStream(outputStream, CompressionMode.Compress);
await inputStream.CopyToAsync(compressStream); // Decompress data
using var decompressStream = new ZstandardStream(inputStream, CompressionMode.Decompress);
await decompressStream.CopyToAsync(outputStream);
- BFloat16 intègre par défaut toutes les interfaces standards pour le numérique
- amélioration de TimeZone
Note de version sur les librairies : https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/11.0/preview/preview1/libraries.md
Sur la partie runtime, il faut s'attendre à de bonnes nouvelles :
- Runtime async : une nouvelle fonction majeure du runtime et méthodes asynchrones pour améliorer les performances. CoreCLR supporte RuntimeAsync par défaut, idem pour Native AOT
- CoreCLR est supporté dans WebAssembly. Il n'est pas encore disponible en preview 1.
- diverses améliorations de performances sur le JIT - meilleur support de RISC-V
Sur C#, pour le moment, peu de nouveautés annoncées. Deux nouvelles fonctions sont attendues : arguments pour les expresssions Collection et support Extended layout. .Net 11 n'introduira aucune nouvelle fonctionnalité pour Visual Basic. Sur ASP.Net Core et Blazor, les développeurs vont avoir beaucoup de nouveautés : EnvironmentBoundary, nouveau composant Label dans les formulaires Blazor, nouveau composant DisplayName, navigation relative Uri, support "propre" des éléments MathML dans un rendu interactif. Tous les détails dans la note de version : https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/11.0/preview/preview1/aspnetcore.md
La génération de source XAML est par défaut pour les applications .Net MAUI, cela doit permettre un build plus rapide et un debug plus performant. Sur Android, CoreCLR devient le runtime par défaut. Sur Container Images et Winfows Forms, pas de nouveautés annoncées.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
En février, il y a la corvée commerciale de la Saint-Valentin et les réjouissances intellectuelles consécutives à la sortie d’une nouvelle version de la suite bureautique LibreOffice. C’est, bien évidemment, sur LibreOffice 26.2 que l’on va se pencher. Au menu, du très visible, comme les boites de dialogues, du très attendu comme la prise en compte du Markdown ou du moins visible comme le travail sur l’accessibilité.
Il va de soi que les notes de version sont plus exhaustives et qu’il ne s’agit ici que d’une sélection. lien nᵒ 1 : Notes de version Sommaire
L’accessibilité
Support du Markdown
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Writer
Calc
En vrac
Pour finir
Avant de commencer : toutes les captures d’écran ont été faites, volontairement, sur une interface très personnalisée.
L’accessibilité
L’accessibilité de la suite bureautique est un important chantier pour lequel une personne a été recrutée en 2023 (en). Cette version-ci a fait l’objet d’améliorations sensibles. Parallèlement, Sophie Gautier, coordinatrice de The Document Foundation1 (Foundation coordinator) est en train de monter un groupe de travail qui a pour objectif la publication d’un rapport de conformité en matière d’accessibilité pour répondre à la norme européenne EN 301 549 (en) d’accessiblité numérique. La langue de travail de ce groupe est l’anglais.
Concernant les améliorations de cette version :
la boite de dialogue « Vérifier les mises à jour », Aide &gt; Vérifier les mises à jour… est devenue accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
les fonctions d’accessibilité des aperçus des bordures, onglet « Bordures » des boites de dialogue, ont été revues afin qu’elles ne perturbent plus les dispositifs d’assistance ;
sur Linux : la boite de dialogue Outils&gt; Orthographe est annoncée correctement par le lecteur d’écran ;
quand on supprimait la sélection accessible, le curseur se déplaçait automatiquement au début du texte, ce comportement perturbant est supprimé ;
dans Writer, les fautes d’orthographe ne sont plus signalées par les dispositifs d’assistance si la vérification orthographique n’est pas activée ;
l’accessibilité au clavier de la boite de dialogue des extensions : Outils &gt; Extensions est accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
et enfin, il est possible de naviguer entre les onglets verticaux avec des raccourcis clavier.
Support du Markdown
Le Markdown est devenu le format de balisage léger standard « de fait ». Et c’est celui supporté par LinuxFR. Son support a été introduit dans cette version, c’est un des formats d’enregistrement qui s’est ajouté à la série des autres formats de la suite, pas un format d’export. Pour l’utiliser pour vos sites, passant pour LinuxFR, vous devrez :
soit ouvrir le fichier .md dans un éditeur de texte, n’importe lequel, même Mousepad fait l’affaire par exemple, et copier-coller ensuite le tout à partir de l’éditeur de texte là où vous le voulez ;
soit, si cela est possible, importer le fichier .md dans ce qui vous sert pour gérer le site comme le fait par exemple l’extension ODT2SPIP pour le système de gestion de contenu SPIP qui permet de créer une nouvelle page dans SPIP avec un fichier.ODT. ça marche avec LinuxFR ? Plutôt bien. Les styles de caractère Accentuation (ici en italiques) et Accentuation forte (ici gras) sont bien reconnu ainsi que Texte source pour « télétype », les indications in-texte encadrées de l’accent grave U+0060. Les styles de paragraphes :
Bloc de citation (paragraphes de citation précédés d’une ligne blanche et du signe « &gt; » dans la saisie de contenu sur LinuxFR) ;
Contenu de tableau ;
Corps de texte ;
Liste, par contre la numérotation des listes ordonnée ne semble pas bien fonctionner, il faut saisir les numéros à la main ;
Texte préformaté pour écrire des blocs de code ;
Titre 1, Titre 2, Titre 3 et Titre de tableau.
Les tableaux sont bien repris ainsi que les liens insérés via l’insertion d’hyperliens.
Ce qui ne semble pas fonctionner du tout : ce sont les notes, elles disparaissent corps et biens. C’est peut-être dû au passage dans l’éditeur de texte qui transforme un peu le document. Et, évidemment, il faut rajouter les images avec la syntaxe LinuxFR.
La version de Mardown de LibreOffice est CommonMark (en) et la bibliothèque utilisée est MD4C avec quelques extensions prises en charge par cette bibliothèque (cf ce rapport de bug (en) et ses réponses), pour en savoir plus, voir cette note (en) du blog de The Document Foundation.
Petite remarque, si vous utilisez un LibreOffice 25.8, vous avez peut-être pu constater qu’il était question d’enregistrement au format .md, cette information a été ajoutée trop précocement car la version 25.8 ne gère pas le Markdown.
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Les boites de dialogue, notamment de styles et de formats, ont beaucoup changé. Longtemps elles se sont affichées avec une présentation par onglets en haut et le contenu dessous.
Puis il y a une période de transition en 2025 qui a fait grincer une collection complète de dents où on avait, selon l’endroit où on était, soit des onglets soit une navigation par menu latéral. Cette dernière avait un gros défaut : par exemple pour la configuration des styles dans Writer il fallait descendre tout en bas pour accéder aux options qui étaient cachées. Et il n’y avait pas de barre de défilement pour aller plus vite.
LibreOffice 26.2 voit ces défauts corrigés : les boites de dialogue sont harmonisées dans toute la suite et leur menu latéral, toujours sans barre de défilement qui s’avère finalement inutile, montre clairement tous les types de paramètres auxquels on peut accéder. Et, comme on peut le voir, LibreOffice a intégré une meilleure prise en charge des systèmes d’écritures asiatiques et complexes en affichant deux colonnes, une pour les polices occidentales, ou pour les polices asiatiques ou complexes. Une personne a également été recrutée en 2023 (en) pour travailler sur le support des systèmes d’écriture de droite à gauche (RTL) et complexes (CTL). Si toutefois, vous préférez revenir à l’affichage avec les onglets, il suffit d’aller dans le menu Outils &gt; Options &gt; Apparenceau niveau de « Boites de dialogue » et cocher l’option Horizontal en haut. Il faut savoir que les onglets en haut ne s’affichent que sur une seule ligne et qu’il faudra donc naviguer avec les flèches quand il y a de nombreuses options. Writer
Il y a un certain nombre d’amélioration autour de la compatibilité avec le format DOCX : séparation de tableaux flottants en plusieurs tableaux, suppression de la numérotation des notes de bas de page à l’ouverture d’un fichier DOCX, etc.
On relèvera deux nouvelles options d’alignement des paragraphes : « Début » et « Fin ». Si vous utilisez l’alphabet latin, vous ne verrez aucune différence avec les deux options « Forcer à gauche/en haut » et « Forcer à droite/en bas ». Elles ont été développées pour réutiliser plus facilement les styles entre les divers systèmes d’écriture. Pour continuer sur la lancée du travail pour la prise en compte des systèmes d’écriture dont le fonctionnement est différent de celui de l’alphabet latin, il est possible de changer la direction du texte : de gauche à droite ou de droite à gauche en cours de travail. Cela peut se paramétrer dans les styles. Calc
Un gros travail sur les performances a été fait : vitesse de défilement, rapidité des classeurs avec de nombreuses formes et du rejet des modifications. On voit apparaître de nouvelles options de tri (Données &gt;Trier) qui dépendent de la « locale » (langue définie dans les Options de LibreOffice). On peut ainsi déterminer quel caractère est utilisé comme séparateur de décimal pour le tri naturel. On peut relever aussi une avancée ergonomique qui va plaire à toutes celles et ceux qui utilisent les matrices, on peut maintenant modifier les formules matricielles avec la combinaison de touches : F2 + ↑ Maj + Ctrl + Entrée, il n’est plus nécessaire de modifier la formule elle-même.
Et aussi : si vous utilisez (pourquoi diable ?) le format d’enregistrement XLSX, c’est le format EXCEL2010+ qui est le format par défaut, il change de nom pour devenir « Classeur Excel 2010-365 ».2
En vrac
Base est devenu complètement multi-utilisateur, TDF a, d’ailleurs, recruté une personne pour travailler sur l’application.
Concernant les diagrammes (ou chart) : dans le Volet latéral, quand le graphique est en mode modification et que l’on va, au niveau de « Couleurs », sur la palette, on a une prévisualisation en direct dans le diagramme ce qui permet de tester le choix de couleurs plus facilement.
Les polices embarquées dont la licence ne permettait pas l’édition étaient jusqu’à présent ignorées et remplacées à l’affichage, ni vu, ni connu par une fonte de substitution. Ce défaut a été corrigé.
L’export PDF gère les liens avec les documents externes : Fichier &gt; Exporter au format PDF &gt; Liens. Les dictionnaires hongrois, mongol et portugais du Portugal ont été mis à jour ainsi que les règles de césure de la langue hongroise.
JSON, pour JavaScript Object Notation, est un format standard utilisé pour représenter des données structurées. Il est utilisé notamment pour échanger les informations entre un navigateur et un serveur. C’est, par exemple, le format de sauvegarde des marques-pages de Firefox ou de certains fichiers d’archives de Mastodon. Les documents XML et JSON génériques avec des plages pouvant être liées sont maintenant automatiquement mappés à des feuilles dans Calc. Une plage pouvant être liée est une section d’un document contenant des enregistrements tabulaires. Lorsqu’un document contient plusieurs plages pouvant être liées, chaque plage est mappée à une seule feuille3.
Et si vous avez envie de vous amuser avec les fonctions expérimentales (à activer dansOutils &gt; Options &gt; LibreOffice &gt; Avancé), vous pouvez jouer avec la nouvelle de boite de dialogue « Gestion des macros ».
Pour finir
Cette dépêche a, bien, évidemment, été rédigée avec LibreOffice et, cette fois-ci dans un fichier enregistré en Markdown. Les seules balises que j’ai dû entrer à la main sont celles des images. Kate a l’air de modifier le fichier et, quand je réouvre le .md dans LibreOffice, il y a des styles qui ont sauté mais la mise en forme reste visuellement la même. Kate rajoute aussi des barres obliques devant les « &gt; », aux crochets [ ] et même à certains hyperliens (images). Il y a peut-être des éditeurs de texte plus adaptés ou des réglages à faire.
J’ai rédigé cette dépêche en même temps qu’un article sur LibreOffice 26.2 pour mon site. Si l’article n’est pas vraiment dupliqué, il n’est pas étonnant d’y trouver des morceaux ici. Que tout cela ne nous empêche d’adresser tous nos remerciements à celles et ceux qui font de LibreOffice une suite bureautique si agréable à utiliser et si performante.
Post-scriptum : si vous voulez savoir modifier les couleurs de l’interface comme sur les captures d’écran, ça peut s’envisager, demandez gentiment, avec un peu de chance.
The Document Foundation ou TDF est la fondation de droit allemand qui pilote le projet LibreOffice. Il y a deux formats OOXML différents et donc deux formats XLSX différents, la version 2007 et la version actuelle depuis 2010. S’il vous est vraiment nécessaire d’enregistrer au format XLSX, il faut utiliser la version de 2010. Notes de version.

### 1. `EN` [Show HN: SalaryScript – The FAANG Negotiation Playbook](data/articles/1ad7751ac2d66c261425aecb1cb24e71.html)
**Source:** Hacker News Show | **Keyword:** `Tech`
Hey HN,
I’m the founder of SalaryScript, and I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on for over a year: a comprehensive negotiation playbook tailored specifically for big tech roles.
I’ve navigated the FAANG hiring gauntlet multiple times myself, with stints at FAANG companies, so I know firsthand how opaque and high-stakes these negotiations can be. I wrote SalaryScript based on my experience, insights from a dozen FAANG-alumni colleagues, and lessons from recruiters I’ve worked with over the years. We’ve pooled perspectives from engineers, PMs, and execs who’ve collectively negotiated millions in total compensation.
Think of it as a “golden rule” book for tech negotiations. It covers everything from decoding offer letters and leveraging competing offers to scripting responses for common recruiter tactics, handling equity cliffs, and navigating relocation packages. No fluff — just battle-tested scripts, templates, and strategies that have helped people increase their total comp by 30–50% on average.
One contributor, a former Meta engineering manager, shared how he turned a $300K offer into $550K by reframing the RSU vesting conversation. Another, an ex-Apple product lead, broke down the psychology of why “total comp” framing often beats focusing on base salary alone.
Since launching last year at an introductory price of $19, we’ve crossed 1,000+ downloads and sales. Demand has been strong, and as word has spread, we’ve gradually raised the price.
If you’re prepping for interviews or staring at an offer right now, this might be the edge you need.
If you’re interested, you can check it out at salaryscript.com.
Would love your thoughts, war stories, or questions like what’s the biggest negotiation win (or fail) you’ve had in tech?

**Source:** Hacker News Show | **Keyword:** `Tech`
I wanted a fast way to turn Markdown files into good-looking PDFs from the terminal. Pandoc + LaTeX is powerful but heavy. Browser-based tools break my workflow. So I built mdxport: one binary, no dependencies, pipe in Markdown, get a PDF.
Under the hood it parses Markdown with comrak, converts to Typst, and compiles to PDF in-process. No LaTeX installation, no network calls, no temp files flying around.
What it handles: LaTeX math ($E=mc^2$, display blocks), GFM tables, fenced code blocks, YAML frontmatter (title/author/lang/toc), and two built-in templates. You can also pass your own .typ template.
CJK support was a pain point I wanted to solve properly. mdxport fonts install downloads Noto CJK fonts, and the converter auto-detects CJK characters and warns if fonts are missing. Chinese/Japanese/Korean documents just work.
Watch mode (mdxport input.md -w) recompiles on save. Stdin works too: cat notes.md | mdxport -o notes.pdf.
Install: npm install -g @mdxport/cli (ships platform-specific binaries, no Rust toolchain needed) or cargo install mdxport.

### 3. `EN` [Show HN: I maintain Valkey GLIDE – built a Node queue doing 48k jobs/s](data/articles/8c0887f73794301d515e2ce7e27497f6.html)
**Source:** Hacker News Show | **Keyword:** `Tech`
Hey HN,
I'm a maintainer of Valkey GLIDE (the official Valkey client) and work on the AWS ElastiCache team. Day job is deep in database client internals — which gives me a clear view of where Node.js job queues hit a ceiling at scale.
The problems with queues like BullMQ aren't subtle: 3+ round-trips per operation, Lua EVAL scripts that NOSCRIPT-error on restart, Lists/BRPOPLPUSH primitives that predate Streams, and complete blindness to cloud topology (cross-AZ bills sneak up on you).
So I built Glide-MQ. High-performance job queue for Node.js built on Valkey/Redis OSS Streams, powered by Valkey GLIDE — a Rust core exposed via native NAPI bindings.
Because I maintain the underlying client, I could go further than an external library ever could:
1-RTT per job — completeAndFetchNext folds completion + next fetch + activation into a single FCALL. No more chatty round-trips.
Server Functions over EVAL — one FUNCTION LOAD, persistent across restarts. NOSCRIPT errors gone entirely.
Streams + Consumer Groups from day one — replaced Lists/BRPOPLPUSH. The PEL gives at-least-once delivery with fewer moving parts.
Cluster-native, not cluster-bolted — hash-tagged keys from day one. No {braces} surprise when you scale out.
AZ-Affinity routing — reads go to same-AZ replicas. Up to 75% reduction in cross-AZ costs on ElastiCache.
Batch API pipelining — addBulk for 1,000 jobs: 228ms to 18ms (12.7x) via GLIDE's non-atomic pipeline.
IAM auth — native ElastiCache/MemoryDB auth with auto token refresh. No secrets in env vars.
Numbers (no-op processor, Valkey 8.0, single node):
- c=1: 4,376 jobs/s | c=10: 15,504 jobs/s | c=50: 48,077 jobs/s
- 15KB payload compressed to 331 bytes (98% savings)
Also included: transparent gzip (zero config), OpenTelemetry tracing, TestQueue/TestWorker in-memory backend for unit tests without running Valkey, and chain()/group()/chord() for job pipeline workflows.
Companion package: @glidemq/dashboard — drop createDashboard([q1, q2]) into any Express (or any other framework) app and get a live REST + SSE UI across all your queues (avifenesh/glidemq-dashboard on GitHub).
Would love brutal testing on it abilities — especially from anyone burned by queue scaling in production. URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47082516

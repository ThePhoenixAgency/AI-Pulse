Apple just can’t seem to get its new Siri off the ground. A new report from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg says that testing of the big Siri overhaul due in iOS 26.4 (soon to enter beta, with a release planned for March) will instead be spread out over the rest of the year. At this point, it’s hard to have confidence that important planned features won’t be delayed further.
Gurman’s sources tell him that testing has “run into snags in recent weeks” and that some of the features will be delayed to iOS 26.5 (due in May) or iOS 27 (due in September).
To recap the timeline:

Like its counterparts on the other Apple devices, in September 2026 macOS got a brand new look along with a new name. Because Apple is aligning the names of all the operating systems this year, the new version of macOS is called macOS 26 rather than macOS 16. It also takes the name Tahoe, inspired by the lake, beaches, and the ski resorts of that area of California. 
Along with a big redesign, macOS 26 brings new Continuity features to bring your iPad, iPhone, and Mac even closer together, a brand new Phone app, and more.

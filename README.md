### 1. [iPhone 17 Pro's Cosmic Orange Color Linked to 38% China Sales Jump](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/china-iphone-17-pro-sales-surge-cosmic-orange/)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
Apple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max have been runaway hits in China, but it has nothing to do with new AI or camera features – it's largely down to the color.


The Cosmic Orange finish made available exclusively on Apple's high-end Pro models has been widely dubbed "Hermès orange" by Chinese consumers who associate the vivid hue with the French luxury brand's signature color. 

Financial Times reports that videos showcasing the orange iPhones have gone viral on Chinese social media since the devices launched in September.

TL;DR: This lifetime Microsoft Office 2024 license works for Mac or PC, and it’s on sale for $99.97 for a limited time.
The main reason many people stick with Microsoft 365 is access to newer features, especially AI tools — but that advantage is gone. Microsoft Office 2024 Home and Business delivers the latest versions of Microsoft’s apps with modern AI integrations, without locking you into a subscription. Instead of paying at least $99.99 every year, you can pay $99.97 once for lifetime access (MSRP $249.99).

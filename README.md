Security teams are still catching malware. The problem is what they're not catching.
More attacks today don't arrive as files. They don't drop binaries. They don't trigger classic alerts. Instead, they run quietly through tools that already exist inside the environment — scripts, remote access, browsers, and developer workflows.
That shift is creating a blind spot.

Well it only took two years, but there’s finally an official YouTube app for Vision Pro. You could always just visit YouTube using the Vision Pro web browser, but that’s not the same thing. And the popular third-party app, Juno, was quickly taken down.
The official YouTube app is not quite an MVP (minimum viable product), but it’s close. It’s just a floating window that can play YouTube videos, including the relatively paltry selection of 3D 360-degree and VR 180-degree videos.

When automating your smart home, much of the attention centers on cameras and lights, but I believe HomeKit door sensors are arguably among the most critical devices to add to your setup. I’ve written about Onvis before, but the Smart Security Alarm Contact Sensor (CS2) takes the concept of a simple door sensor and turns it into a lot more. It supports Thread, but the really cool add-on here is a 120dB siren built right into the sensor. Let’s take a look at the Onvis CS2.

The Ugreen NASync DH4300 is a very easy-to-use NAS for beginners who need more capacity than your typical entry-level network storage appliance.


Ugreen NASync DH4300 Plus
We're getting to a point with cloud storage that in the long run, having a local cloud is a good idea. And, network attached storage (NAS) isn't just for networking experts anymore.
But, it's easy to underestimate needs. That local cloud basic user could go for entry-level options with two drives, which is fine for most, but when you start thinking about other stuff to do, simply isn't enough when data storage needs grow.

Apple's autocorrect on iPhone and iPad always aims to help when you're typing a message, but it's by no means perfect, and some of the replacements it continually spews out can be frustrating. Fortunately, Apple's software includes a feature called Text Replacement that allows you to specify what word or phrase replaces the specific text you type in. 


Even if you haven't set up Text Replacement, you can try it out with Apple's pre-set example: In any app that accepts text input, type "Omw" followed by a space, and it will change to "On my way!" automatically.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
Following reports of dwindling stocks of the iPhone 16e, there are now ones about the Mac Studio. While a new one is coming, in 2026 there are just too many external factors to use it as a reliable indicator of an imminent launch.


Two Mac Studios, stacked
It seems such an obvious thing — if Apple is running low on the Mac Studio, it's because a new one is coming. And it seems such an easy thing to spot, since the online Apple Store details how long the delivery time is for any item.

We absolutely love a good iPad deal, and it just so happens that Apple’s cheapest tablet has dropped to the best price we’ve yet to see this year. You can get this gorgeous 11-inch iPad for $300 at Amazon, a savings of $50 on its usual MSRP.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
Apple's autocorrect on iPhone and iPad always aims to help when you're typing a message, but it's by no means perfect, and some of the replacements it continually spews out can be frustrating. Fortunately, Apple's software includes a feature called Text Replacement that allows you to specify what word or phrase replaces the specific text you type in. 


Even if you haven't set up Text Replacement, you can try it out with Apple's pre-set example: In any app that accepts text input, type "Omw" followed by a space, and it will change to "On my way!" automatically.

The iPhone 17e, one of Apple’s most highly anticipated products for 2026, could arrive in less than a week. But the announcement is unlikely to hold many surprises, because the leaks are now coming thick and fast.
Take the tech specs. We’re reasonably confident that the 17e will feature most or all of the following: an A19 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of starting storage (up from 128GB), a C1X modem, the same single 48MP rear-facing camera as on the 16e (although the selfie camera could get an upgrade), a 60Hz 6.1-inch screen, support for MagSafe, and a starting price of $599.

For the past decade, my Apple Time Capsule has faithfully backed up my Mac. I’ve been through several upgrades over the past decade—my current machine is an M3 Max MacBook Pro—and I’ve never had an issue with my Time Capsule. It’s been one of the most reliable devices I’ve ever owned, and I’ve barely had to even think about it since I bought it in 2016.
Until recently, that is. I don’t know the exact date, but I installed macOS Tahoe 26.2 sometime near the end of 2025.

### 1. `EN` [Railway secures $100 million to challenge AWS with AI-native cloud infrastructure](data/articles/e670024b9a32e878ab282337aaddf6f9.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Railway, a San Francisco-based cloud platform that has quietly amassed two million developers without spending a dollar on marketing, announced Thursday that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, as surging demand for artificial intelligence applications exposes the limitations of legacy cloud infrastructure.
TQ Ventures led the round, with participation from FPV Ventures, Redpoint, and Unusual Ventures. The investment values Railway as one of the most significant infrastructure startups to emerge during the AI boom, capitalizing on developer frustration with the complexity and cost of traditional platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.
"As AI models get better at writing code, more and more people are asking the age-old question: where, and how, do I run my applications?" said Jake Cooper, Railway's 28-year-old founder and chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. "The last generation of cloud primitives were slow and outdated, and now with AI moving everything faster, teams simply can't keep up."
The funding is a dramatic acceleration for a company that has charted an unconventional path through the cloud computing industry. Railway raised just $24 million in total before this round, including a $20 million Series A from Redpoint in 2022. The company now processes more than 10 million deployments monthly and handles over one trillion requests through its edge network — metrics that rival far larger and better-funded competitors.
Why three-minute deploy times have become unacceptable in the age of AI coding assistants
Railway's pitch rests on a simple observation: the tools developers use to deploy and manage software were designed for a slower era. A standard build-and-deploy cycle using Terraform, the industry-standard infrastructure tool, takes two to three minutes. That delay, once tolerable, has become a critical bottleneck as AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor can generate working code in seconds.
"When godly intelligence is on tap and can solve any problem in three seconds, those amalgamations of systems become bottlenecks," Cooper told VentureBeat. "What was really cool for humans to deploy in 10 seconds or less is now table stakes for agents."
The company claims its platform delivers deployments in under one second — fast enough to keep pace with AI-generated code. Customers report a tenfold increase in developer velocity and up to 65 percent cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.
These numbers come directly from enterprise clients, not internal benchmarks. Daniel Lobaton, chief technology officer at G2X, a platform serving 100,000 federal contractors, measured deployment speed improvements of seven times faster and an 87 percent cost reduction after migrating to Railway. His infrastructure bill dropped from $15,000 per month to approximately $1,000.
"The work that used to take me a week on our previous infrastructure, I can do in Railway in like a day," Lobaton said. "If I want to spin up a new service and test different architectures, it would take so long on our old setup. In Railway I can launch six services in two minutes."
Inside the controversial decision to abandon Google Cloud and build data centers from scratch
What distinguishes Railway from competitors like Render and Fly.io is the depth of its vertical integration. In 2024, the company made the unusual decision to abandon Google Cloud entirely and build its own data centers, a move that echoes the famous Alan Kay maxim: "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware."
"We wanted to design hardware in a way where we could build a differentiated experience," Cooper said. "Having full control over the network, compute, and storage layers lets us do really fast build and deploy loops, the kind that allows us to move at 'agentic speed' while staying 100 percent the smoothest ride in town."
The approach paid dividends during recent widespread outages that affected major cloud providers — Railway remained online throughout.
This soup-to-nuts control enables pricing that undercuts the hyperscalers by roughly 50 percent and newer cloud startups by three to four times. Railway charges by the second for actual compute usage: $0.00000386 per gigabyte-second of memory, $0.00000772 per vCPU-second, and $0.00000006 per gigabyte-second of storage. There are no charges for idle virtual machines — a stark contrast to the traditional cloud model where customers pay for provisioned capacity whether they use it or not.
"The conventional wisdom is that the big guys have economies of scale to offer better pricing," Cooper noted. "But when they're charging for VMs that usually sit idle in the cloud, and we've purpose-built everything to fit much more density on these machines, you have a big opportunity."
How 30 employees built a platform generating tens of millions in annual revenue
Railway has achieved its scale with a team of just 30 employees generating tens of millions in annual revenue — a ratio of revenue per employee that would be exceptional even for established software companies. The company grew revenue 3.5 times last year and continues to expand at 15 percent month-over-month.
Cooper emphasized that the fundraise was strategic rather than necessary. "We're default alive; there's no reason for us to raise money," he said. "We raised because we see a massive opportunity to accelerate, not because we needed to survive."
The company hired its first salesperson only last year and employs just two solutions engineers. Nearly all of Railway's two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.
"We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come," Cooper recalled. "And to some degree, they came."
From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway's unlikely corporate expansion
Despite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.
Notable customers include Bilt, the loyalty program company; Intuit's GoCo subsidiary; TripAdvisor's Cruise Critic; and MGM Resorts. Kernel, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.
"At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS," said Rafael Garcia, Kernel's chief technology officer. "Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012."
For enterprise customers, Railway offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer's existing cloud environment through a "bring your own cloud" configuration.
Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).
The startup's bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivals
Railway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.
Cooper argues that Railway's competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.
"The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven't gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money," he observed. "They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don't really need to?"
Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. "We're not just containers; we've got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing," Cooper said. "And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster."
The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.
Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists today
Railway's fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.
"The amount of software that's going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we're talking a thousand times more software," Cooper predicted. "All of that has to run somewhere."
The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls "loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically." Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.
"The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes," Cooper said. "You don't have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity."
What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experience
Railway plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company's five-year history.
"One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business," Cooper explained. "We've built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what's been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage."
The company's investor roster reads like a who's who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Guillermo Rauch, chief executive of Vercel; Spencer Kimball, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; Olivier Pomel, chief executive of Datadog; and Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear.
The timing of Railway's expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper's telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.
Whether Railway can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at Wolfram Alpha, Bloomberg, and Uber before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.
"In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period," he said. "Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That's the prize worth playing for, and there's no bigger one on offer."
For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.

### 2. `EN` [Claude Code costs up to $200 a month. Goose does the same thing for free.](data/articles/1bd5d5f60cc30b30eee498627c185f8f.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
The artificial intelligence coding revolution comes with a catch: it's expensive.
Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-based AI agent that can write, debug, and deploy code autonomously, has captured the imagination of software developers worldwide. But its pricing — ranging from $20 to $200 per month depending on usage — has sparked a growing rebellion among the very programmers it aims to serve.
Now, a free alternative is gaining traction. Goose, an open-source AI agent developed by Block (the financial technology company formerly known as Square), offers nearly identical functionality to Claude Code but runs entirely on a user's local machine. No subscription fees. No cloud dependency. No rate limits that reset every five hours.
"Your data stays with you, period," said Parth Sareen, a software engineer who demonstrated the tool during a recent livestream. The captures the core appeal: Goose gives developers complete control over their AI-powered workflow, including the ability to work offline — even on an airplane.
The project has exploded in popularity. Goose now boasts more than 26,100 stars on GitHub, the code-sharing platform, with 362 contributors and 102 releases since its launch. The latest version, 1.20.1, shipped on January 19, 2026, reflecting a development pace that rivals commercial products.
For developers frustrated by Claude Code's pricing structure and usage caps, Goose represents something increasingly rare in the AI industry: a genuinely free, no-strings-attached option for serious work. Anthropic's new rate limits spark a developer revolt
To understand why Goose matters, you need to understand the Claude Code pricing controversy.
Anthropic, the San Francisco artificial intelligence company founded by former OpenAI executives, offers Claude Code as part of its subscription tiers. The free plan provides no access whatsoever. The Pro plan, at $17 per month with annual billing (or $20 monthly), limits users to just 10 to 40 prompts every five hours — a constraint that serious developers exhaust within minutes of intensive work.
The Max plans, at $100 and $200 per month, offer more headroom: 50 to 200 prompts and 200 to 800 prompts respectively, plus access to Anthropic's most powerful model, Claude 4.5 Opus. But even these premium tiers come with restrictions that have inflamed the developer community.
In late July, Anthropic announced new weekly rate limits. Under the system, Pro users receive 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 usage per week. Max users at the $200 tier get 240 to 480 hours of Sonnet 4, plus 24 to 40 hours of Opus 4. Nearly five months later, the frustration has not subsided.
The problem? Those "hours" are not actual hours. They represent token-based limits that vary wildly depending on codebase size, conversation length, and the complexity of the code being processed. Independent analysis suggests the actual per-session limits translate to roughly 44,000 tokens for Pro users and 220,000 tokens for the $200 Max plan.
"It's confusing and vague," one developer wrote in a widely shared analysis. "When they say '24-40 hours of Opus 4,' that doesn't really tell you anything useful about what you're actually getting."
The backlash on Reddit and developer forums has been fierce. Some users report hitting their daily limits within 30 minutes of intensive coding. Others have canceled their subscriptions entirely, calling the new restrictions "a joke" and "unusable for real work."
Anthropic has defended the changes, stating that the limits affect fewer than five percent of users and target people running Claude Code "continuously in the background, 24/7." But the company has not clarified whether that figure refers to five percent of Max subscribers or five percent of all users — a distinction that matters enormously.
How Block built a free AI coding agent that works offline
Goose takes a radically different approach to the same problem.
Built by Block, the payments company led by Jack Dorsey, Goose is what engineers call an "on-machine AI agent." Unlike Claude Code, which sends your queries to Anthropic's servers for processing, Goose can run entirely on your local computer using open-source language models that you download and control yourself.
The project's documentation describes it as going "beyond code suggestions" to "install, execute, edit, and test with any LLM." That last phrase — "any LLM" — is the key differentiator. Goose is model-agnostic by design.
You can connect Goose to Anthropic's Claude models if you have API access. You can use OpenAI's GPT-5 or Google's Gemini. You can route it through services like Groq or OpenRouter. Or — and this is where things get interesting — you can run it entirely locally using tools like Ollama, which let you download and execute open-source models on your own hardware.
The practical implications are significant. With a local setup, there are no subscription fees, no usage caps, no rate limits, and no concerns about your code being sent to external servers. Your conversations with the AI never leave your machine.
"I use Ollama all the time on planes — it's a lot of fun!" Sareen noted during a demonstration, highlighting how local models free developers from the constraints of internet connectivity.
What Goose can do that traditional code assistants can't
Goose operates as a command-line tool or desktop application that can autonomously perform complex development tasks. It can build entire projects from scratch, write and execute code, debug failures, orchestrate workflows across multiple files, and interact with external APIs — all without constant human oversight.
The architecture relies on what the AI industry calls "tool calling" or "function calling" — the ability for a language model to request specific actions from external systems. When you ask Goose to create a new file, run a test suite, or check the status of a GitHub pull request, it doesn't just generate text describing what should happen. It actually executes those operations.
This capability depends heavily on the underlying language model. Claude 4 models from Anthropic currently perform best at tool calling, according to the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, which ranks models on their ability to translate natural language requests into executable code and system commands.
But newer open-source models are catching up quickly. Goose's documentation highlights several options with strong tool-calling support: Meta's Llama series, Alibaba's Qwen models, Google's Gemma variants, and DeepSeek's reasoning-focused architectures.
The tool also integrates with the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, an emerging standard for connecting AI agents to external services. Through MCP, Goose can access databases, search engines, file systems, and third-party APIs — extending its capabilities far beyond what the base language model provides.
Setting Up Goose with a Local Model
For developers interested in a completely free, privacy-preserving setup, the process involves three main components: Goose itself, Ollama (a tool for running open-source models locally), and a compatible language model.
Step 1: Install Ollama
Ollama is an open-source project that dramatically simplifies the process of running large language models on personal hardware. It handles the complex work of downloading, optimizing, and serving models through a simple interface.
Download and install Ollama from ollama.com. Once installed, you can pull models with a single command. For coding tasks, Qwen 2.5 offers strong tool-calling support:
ollama run qwen2.5
The model downloads automatically and begins running on your machine.
Step 2: Install Goose
Goose is available as both a desktop application and a command-line interface. The desktop version provides a more visual experience, while the CLI appeals to developers who prefer working entirely in the terminal.
Installation instructions vary by operating system but generally involve downloading from Goose's GitHub releases page or using a package manager. Block provides pre-built binaries for macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux.
Step 3: Configure the Connection
In Goose Desktop, navigate to Settings, then Configure Provider, and select Ollama. Confirm that the API Host is set to http://localhost:11434 (Ollama's default port) and click Submit.
For the command-line version, run goose configure, select "Configure Providers," choose Ollama, and enter the model name when prompted.
That's it. Goose is now connected to a language model running entirely on your hardware, ready to execute complex coding tasks without any subscription fees or external dependencies.
The RAM, processing power, and trade-offs you should know about
The obvious question: what kind of computer do you need?
Running large language models locally requires substantially more computational resources than typical software. The key constraint is memory — specifically, RAM on most systems, or VRAM if using a dedicated graphics card for acceleration.
Block's documentation suggests that 32 gigabytes of RAM provides "a solid baseline for larger models and outputs." For Mac users, this means the computer's unified memory is the primary bottleneck. For Windows and Linux users with discrete NVIDIA graphics cards, GPU memory (VRAM) matters more for acceleration.
But you don't necessarily need expensive hardware to get started. Smaller models with fewer parameters run on much more modest systems. Qwen 2.5, for instance, comes in multiple sizes, and the smaller variants can operate effectively on machines with 16 gigabytes of RAM.
"You don't need to run the largest models to get excellent results," Sareen emphasized. The practical recommendation: start with a smaller model to test your workflow, then scale up as needed.
For context, Apple's entry-level MacBook Air with 8 gigabytes of RAM would struggle with most capable coding models. But a MacBook Pro with 32 gigabytes — increasingly common among professional developers — handles them comfortably.
Why keeping your code off the cloud matters more than ever
Goose with a local LLM is not a perfect substitute for Claude Code. The comparison involves real trade-offs that developers should understand.
Model Quality: Claude 4.5 Opus, Anthropic's flagship model, remains arguably the most capable AI for software engineering tasks. It excels at understanding complex codebases, following nuanced instructions, and producing high-quality code on the first attempt. Open-source models have improved dramatically, but a gap persists — particularly for the most challenging tasks.
One developer who switched to the $200 Claude Code plan described the difference bluntly: "When I say 'make this look modern,' Opus knows what I mean. Other models give me Bootstrap circa 2015."
Context Window: Claude Sonnet 4.5, accessible through the API, offers a massive one-million-token context window — enough to load entire large codebases without chunking or context management issues. Most local models are limited to 4,096 or 8,192 tokens by default, though many can be configured for longer contexts at the cost of increased memory usage and slower processing.
Speed: Cloud-based services like Claude Code run on dedicated server hardware optimized for AI inference. Local models, running on consumer laptops, typically process requests more slowly. The difference matters for iterative workflows where you're making rapid changes and waiting for AI feedback.
Tooling Maturity: Claude Code benefits from Anthropic's dedicated engineering resources. Features like prompt caching (which can reduce costs by up to 90 percent for repeated contexts) and structured outputs are polished and well-documented. Goose, while actively developed with 102 releases to date, relies on community contributions and may lack equivalent refinement in specific areas.
How Goose stacks up against Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and the paid AI coding market
Goose enters a crowded market of AI coding tools, but occupies a distinctive position.
Cursor, a popular AI-enhanced code editor, charges $20 per month for its Pro tier and $200 for Ultra—pricing that mirrors Claude Code's Max plans. Cursor provides approximately 4,500 Sonnet 4 requests per month at the Ultra level, a substantially different allocation model than Claude Code's hourly resets.
Cline, Roo Code, and similar open-source projects offer AI coding assistance but with varying levels of autonomy and tool integration. Many focus on code completion rather than the agentic task execution that defines Goose and Claude Code.
Amazon's CodeWhisperer, GitHub Copilot, and enterprise offerings from major cloud providers target large organizations with complex procurement processes and dedicated budgets. They are less relevant to individual developers and small teams seeking lightweight, flexible tools.
Goose's combination of genuine autonomy, model agnosticism, local operation, and zero cost creates a unique value proposition. The tool is not trying to compete with commercial offerings on polish or model quality. It's competing on freedom — both financial and architectural.
The $200-a-month era for AI coding tools may be ending

### 3. `EN` [Nous Research's NousCoder-14B is an open-source coding model landing right in the Claude Code moment](data/articles/b37d936464575171be4586234d600b41.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Nous Research, the open-source artificial intelligence startup backed by crypto venture firm Paradigm, released a new competitive programming model on Monday that it says matches or exceeds several larger proprietary systems — trained in just four days using 48 of Nvidia's latest B200 graphics processors.
The model, called NousCoder-14B, is another entry in a crowded field of AI coding assistants, but arrives at a particularly charged moment: Claude Code, the agentic programming tool from rival Anthropic, has dominated social media discussion since New Year's Day, with developers posting breathless testimonials about its capabilities. The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving — and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written.
type: embedded-entry-inline id: 74cSyrq6OUrp9SEQ5zOUSl
NousCoder-14B achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on LiveCodeBench v6, a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba's Qwen3-14B, according to Nous Research's technical report published alongside the release.
"I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour," wrote Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing — a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt.
The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic's Claude Code has captured imaginations with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap — and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability. How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicate
What distinguishes the NousCoder-14B release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the model weights but the complete reinforcement learning environment, benchmark suite, and training harness — built on the company's Atropos framework — enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to reproduce or extend the work.
"Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research," noted one observer on X, summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities.
The model was trained by Joe Li, a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li's technical report reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model's improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance.
Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B's improvemen t— from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 — mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days.
"Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience," Li wrote in the technical report.
But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners. Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problems
NousCoder-14B's training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.
The approach relies on what researchers call "verifiable rewards" — a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale.
Nous Research used Modal, a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints — 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively.
The training employed a technique called DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization), which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves "dynamic sampling" — discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning.
The researchers also adopted "iterative context extension," first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent.
Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification — as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters. The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progress
Buried in Li's technical report is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses "a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format."
In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data.
"The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude," Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. "This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data."
This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is "increasingly finite," as Li put it.
"It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures," he concluded.
The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn't — making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult.
Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. "Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction," he wrote. A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big Tech

**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup, Listen Labs, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million offers seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a billboard in San Francisco displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.
The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.
That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by Ribbit Capital with participation from Evantic and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Conviction, and Pear VC. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews. "When you obsess over customers, everything else follows," Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. "Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is."
Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it
Listen's AI researcher finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.
Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: "Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can't get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys." The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, "gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they're talking about. And the problem is you can't scale that."
The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.
What distinguishes Listen's approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. "In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options," Wahlforss said. "Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty."
The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraud
Listen finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called "one of the most shocking things that we've learned when we entered this industry"—rampant fraud.
"Essentially, there's a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players," he explained. "We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud."
The company built what it calls a "quality guard" that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: "People talk three times more. They're much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health."
Emeritus, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. "We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information," said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.
How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better products
The speed advantage has proven central to Listen's pitch. Traditional customer research at Microsoft could take four to six weeks to generate insights. "By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it," said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.
With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.
The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. "We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward," Patel said, "and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day." Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.
Simple Modern, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. "We went from 'Should we even have this product?' to 'How should we launch it?'" said Chris Hoyle, the company's Chief Marketing Officer.
Chubbies, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. "There's school, sports, dinner, and homework," explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. "I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules."
The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI "through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed." The redesigned product became "a blockbuster hit."
The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not less
Listen Labs is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly $140 billion annually, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption.
"There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing," Wahlforss said. "Why we're replacing them is that one, they're super costly. Two, they're kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with."
But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn't just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption.
"What I've noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don't need less of it. You want more of it," Wahlforss explained. "There's infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren't researchers before can now do that as part of their job."
Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toilet
Listen Labs traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. "We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day," Wahlforss recalled. "We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today."
The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss's co-founder "was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot." The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the International Olympiad in Informatics — the same competition that produced the founders of Cognition, the AI coding startup.
The Berghain billboard stunt generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.
"We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet," he said. "But now we fixed that situation."
The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.
Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building next
Wahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building "the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we've done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices."
Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. "Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?"
Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. "Obviously, as you said, there's kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop."
The company already handles sensitive data with care. "We don't train on any of the data," Wahlforss said. "We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that."
How AI could reshape the future of product development
Perhaps the most provocative implication of Listen's model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop.
"They're based in Australia, so they're coding during the day, and then in their night, they're releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate."
The vision extends Y Combinator's famous dictum — "write code, talk to users" — into an automated cycle. "Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you'll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously."
Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen's control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A 2024 MIT study found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos.
"I'm constantly have to emphasize like, let's make sure the quality is there and the details are right," he said.
But the company's growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft's Patel said Listen has "removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work." Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day.
"It's a total game changer," said Ali Romero, Sling Money's marketing manager.
Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he's building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website.
One of them: "Slow is fake."
It's an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution. But Listen Labs is betting that in the AI era, the companies that listen fastest will be the ones that win. The only question is whether customers will talk back.

### 5. `EN` [Salesforce rolls out new Slackbot AI agent as it battles Microsoft and Google in workplace AI](data/articles/db7ff708ed2fd3ffb22714bc4e846e1c.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Salesforce on Tuesday launched an entirely rebuilt version of Slackbot, the company's workplace assistant, transforming it from a simple notification tool into what executives describe as a fully powered AI agent capable of searching enterprise data, drafting documents, and taking action on behalf of employees.
The new Slackbot, now generally available to Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, is Salesforce's most aggressive move yet to position Slack at the center of the emerging "agentic AI" movement — where software agents work alongside humans to complete complex tasks. The launch comes as Salesforce attempts to convince investors that artificial intelligence will bolster its products rather than render them obsolete.
"Slackbot isn't just another copilot or AI assistant," said Parker Harris, Salesforce co-founder and Slack's chief technology officer, in an exclusive interview with Salesforce. "It's the front door to the agentic enterprise, powered by Salesforce."
From tricycle to Porsche: Salesforce rebuilt Slackbot from the ground up
Harris was blunt about what distinguishes the new Slackbot from its predecessor: "The old Slackbot was, you know, a little tricycle, and the new Slackbot is like, you know, a Porsche."
The original Slackbot, which has existed since Slack's early days, performed basic algorithmic tasks — reminding users to add colleagues to documents, suggesting channel archives, and delivering simple notifications. The new version runs on an entirely different architecture built around a large language model and sophisticated search capabilities that can access Salesforce records, Google Drive files, calendar data, and years of Slack conversations.
"It's two different things," Harris explained. "The old Slackbot was algorithmic and fairly simple. The new Slackbot is brand new — it's based around an LLM and a very robust search engine, and connections to third-party search engines, third-party enterprise data."
Salesforce chose to retain the Slackbot brand despite the fundamental technical overhaul. "People know what Slackbot is, and so we wanted to carry that forward," Harris said.
Why Anthropic's Claude powers the new Slackbot — and which AI models could come next
The new Slackbot runs on Claude, Anthropic's large language model, a choice driven partly by compliance requirements. Slack's commercial service operates under FedRAMP Moderate certification to serve U.S. federal government customers, and Harris said Anthropic was "the only provider that could give us a compliant LLM" when Slack began building the new system.
But that exclusivity won't last. "We are, this year, going to support additional providers," Harris said. "We have a great relationship with Google. Gemini is incredible — performance is great, cost is great. So we're going to use Gemini for some things." He added that OpenAI remains a possibility as well.
Harris echoed Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's view that large language models are becoming commoditized: "You've heard Marc talk about LLMs are commodities, that they're democratized. I call them CPUs."
On the sensitive question of training data, Harris was unequivocal: Salesforce does not train any models on customer data. "Models don't have any sort of security," he explained. "If we trained it on some confidential conversation that you and I have, I don't want Carolyn to know — if I train it into the LLM, there is no way for me to say you get to see the answer, but Carolyn doesn't."
Inside Salesforce's internal experiment: 80,000 employees tested Slackbot with striking results
Salesforce has been testing the new Slackbot internally for months, rolling it out to all 80,000 employees. According to Ryan Gavin, Slack's chief marketing officer, the results have been striking: "It's the fastest adopted product in Salesforce history."
Internal data shows that two-thirds of Salesforce employees have tried the new Slackbot, with 80% of those users continuing to use it regularly. Internal satisfaction rates reached 96% — the highest for any AI feature Slack has shipped. Employees report saving between two and 20 hours per week.
The adoption happened largely organically. "I think it was about five days, and a Canvas was developed by our employees called 'The Most Stealable Slackbot Prompts,'" Gavin said. "People just started adding to it organically. I think it's up to 250-plus prompts that are in this Canvas right now."
Kate Crotty, a principal UX researcher at Salesforce, found that 73% of internal adoption was driven by social sharing rather than top-down mandates. "Everybody is there to help each other learn and communicate hacks," she said.
How Slackbot transforms scattered enterprise data into executive-ready insights
During a product demonstration, Amy Bauer, Slack's product experience designer, showed how Slackbot can synthesize information across multiple sources. In one example, she asked Slackbot to analyze customer feedback from a pilot program, upload an image of a usage dashboard, and have Slackbot correlate the qualitative and quantitative data.
"This is where Slackbot really earns its keep for me," Bauer explained. "What it's doing is not just simply reading the image — it's actually looking at the image and comparing it to the insight it just generated for me."
Slackbot can then query Salesforce to find enterprise accounts with open deals that might be good candidates for early access, creating what Bauer called "a really great justification and plan to move forward." Finally, it can synthesize all that information into a Canvas — Slack's collaborative document format — and find calendar availability among stakeholders to schedule a review meeting.
"Up until this point, we have been working in a one-to-one capacity with Slackbot," Bauer said. "But one of the benefits that I can do now is take this insight and have it generate this into a Canvas, a shared workspace where I can iterate on it, refine it with Slackbot, or share it out with my team."
Rob Seaman, Slack's chief product officer, said the Canvas creation demonstrates where the product is heading: "This is making a tool call internally to Slack Canvas to actually write, effectively, a shared document. But it signals where we're going with Slackbot — we're eventually going to be adding in additional third-party tool calls."
MrBeast's company became a Slackbot guinea pig—and employees say they're saving 90 minutes a day
Among Salesforce's pilot customers is Beast Industries, the parent company of YouTube star MrBeast. Luis Madrigal, the company's chief information officer, joined the launch announcement to describe his experience.
"As somebody who has rolled out enterprise technologies for over two decades now, this was practically one of the easiest," Madrigal said. "The plumbing is there. Slack as an implementation, Enterprise Tools — being able to turn on the Slackbot and the Slack AI functionality was as simple as having my team go in, review, do a quick security review."
Madrigal said his security team signed off "rather quickly" — unusual for enterprise AI deployments — because Slackbot accesses only the information each individual user already has permission to view. "Given all the guardrails you guys have put into place for Slackbot to be unique and customized to only the information that each individual user has, only the conversations and the Slack rooms and Slack channels that they're part of—that made my security team sign off rather quickly."
One Beast Industries employee, Sinan, the head of Beast Games marketing, reported saving "at bare minimum, 90 minutes a day." Another employee, Spencer, a creative supervisor, described it as "an assistant who's paying attention when I'm not."
Other pilot customers include Slalom, reMarkable, Xero, Mercari, and Engine. Mollie Bodensteiner, SVP of Operations at Engine, called Slackbot "an absolute 'chaos tamer' for our team," estimating it saves her about 30 minutes daily "just by eliminating context switching."

### 6. `EN` [Anthropic launches Cowork, a Claude Desktop agent that works in your files — no coding required](data/articles/a102a18a5efc083299a9baaa1b4a8378.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Anthropic released Cowork on Monday, a new AI agent capability that extends the power of its wildly successful Claude Code tool to non-technical users — and according to company insiders, the team built the entire feature in approximately a week and a half, largely using Claude Code itself.
The launch marks a major inflection point in the race to deliver practical AI agents to mainstream users, positioning Anthropic to compete not just with OpenAI and Google in conversational AI, but with Microsoft's Copilot in the burgeoning market for AI-powered productivity tools.
"Cowork lets you complete non-technical tasks much like how developers use Claude Code," the company announced via its official Claude account on X. The feature arrives as a research preview available exclusively to Claude Max subscribers — Anthropic's power-user tier priced between $100 and $200 per month — through the macOS desktop application.
For the past year, the industry narrative has focused on large language models that can write poetry or debug code. With Cowork, Anthropic is betting that the real enterprise value lies in an AI that can open a folder, read a messy pile of receipts, and generate a structured expense report without human hand-holding. How developers using a coding tool for vacation research inspired Anthropic's latest product
The genesis of Cowork lies in Anthropic's recent success with the developer community. In late 2024, the company released Claude Code, a terminal-based tool that allowed software engineers to automate rote programming tasks. The tool was a hit, but Anthropic noticed a peculiar trend: users were forcing the coding tool to perform non-coding labor.
According to Boris Cherny, an engineer at Anthropic, the company observed users deploying the developer tool for an unexpectedly diverse array of tasks. "Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven," Cherny wrote on X. "These use cases are diverse and surprising — the reason is that the underlying Claude Agent is the best agent, and Opus 4.5 is the best model."
Recognizing this shadow usage, Anthropic effectively stripped the command-line complexity from their developer tool to create a consumer-friendly interface. In its blog post announcing the feature, Anthropic explained that developers "quickly began using it for almost everything else," which "prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude in the very same way."
Inside the folder-based architecture that lets Claude read, edit, and create files on your computer
Unlike a standard chat interface where a user pastes text for analysis, Cowork requires a different level of trust and access. Users designate a specific folder on their local machine that Claude can access. Within that sandbox, the AI agent can read existing files, modify them, or create entirely new ones.
Anthropic offers several illustrative examples: reorganizing a cluttered downloads folder by sorting and intelligently renaming each file, generating a spreadsheet of expenses from a collection of receipt screenshots, or drafting a report from scattered notes across multiple documents.
"In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder," the company explained on X. "Try it to create a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft from scattered notes." The architecture relies on what is known as an "agentic loop." When a user assigns a task, the AI does not merely generate a text response. Instead, it formulates a plan, executes steps in parallel, checks its own work, and asks for clarification if it hits a roadblock. Users can queue multiple tasks and let Claude process them simultaneously — a workflow Anthropic describes as feeling "much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker."
The system is built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK, meaning it shares the same underlying architecture as Claude Code. Anthropic notes that Cowork "can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks."
The recursive loop where AI builds AI: Claude Code reportedly wrote much of Claude Cowork
Perhaps the most remarkable detail surrounding Cowork's launch is the speed at which the tool was reportedly built — highlighting a recursive feedback loop where AI tools are being used to build better AI tools.
During a livestream hosted by Dan Shipper, Felix Rieseberg, an Anthropic employee, confirmed that the team built Cowork in approximately a week and a half.
Alex Volkov, who covers AI developments, expressed surprise at the timeline: "Holy shit Anthropic built 'Cowork' in the last... week and a half?!" This prompted immediate speculation about how much of Cowork was itself built by Claude Code. Simon Smith, EVP of Generative AI at Klick Health, put it bluntly on X: "Claude Code wrote all of Claude Cowork. Can we all agree that we're in at least somewhat of a recursive improvement loop here?"
The implication is profound: Anthropic's AI coding agent may have substantially contributed to building its own non-technical sibling product. If true, this is one of the most visible examples yet of AI systems being used to accelerate their own development and expansion — a strategy that could widen the gap between AI labs that successfully deploy their own agents internally and those that do not.
Connectors, browser automation, and skills extend Cowork's reach beyond the local file system
Cowork doesn't operate in isolation. The feature integrates with Anthropic's existing ecosystem of connectors — tools that link Claude to external information sources and services such as Asana, Notion, PayPal, and other supported partners. Users who have configured these connections in the standard Claude interface can leverage them within Cowork sessions.
Additionally, Cowork can pair with Claude in Chrome, Anthropic's browser extension, to execute tasks requiring web access. This combination allows the agent to navigate websites, click buttons, fill forms, and extract information from the internet — all while operating from the desktop application.
"Cowork includes a number of novel UX and safety features that we think make the product really special," Cherny explained, highlighting "a built-in VM [virtual machine] for isolation, out of the box support for browser automation, support for all your claude.ai data connectors, asking you for clarification when it's unsure."
Anthropic has also introduced an initial set of "skills" specifically designed for Cowork that enhance Claude's ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. These build on the Skills for Claude framework the company announced in October, which provides specialized instruction sets Claude can load for particular types of tasks.
Why Anthropic is warning users that its own AI agent could delete their files
The transition from a chatbot that suggests edits to an agent that makes edits introduces significant risk. An AI that can organize files can, theoretically, delete them.
In a notable display of transparency, Anthropic devoted considerable space in its announcement to warning users about Cowork's potential dangers — an unusual approach for a product launch.
The company explicitly acknowledges that Claude "can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it's instructed to." Because Claude might occasionally misinterpret instructions, Anthropic urges users to provide "very clear guidance" about sensitive operations.
More concerning is the risk of prompt injection attacks — a technique where malicious actors embed hidden instructions in content Claude might encounter online, potentially causing the agent to bypass safeguards or take harmful actions.
"We've built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections," Anthropic wrote, "but agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude's real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry."
The company characterized these risks as inherent to the current state of AI agent technology rather than unique to Cowork. "These risks aren't new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you're using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation," the announcement notes.
Anthropic's desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft Copilot
The launch of Cowork places Anthropic in direct competition with Microsoft, which has spent years attempting to integrate its Copilot AI into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.
However, Anthropic's approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application.
What distinguishes Anthropic's approach is its bottom-up evolution. Rather than designing an AI assistant and retrofitting agent capabilities, Anthropic built a powerful coding agent first — Claude Code — and is now abstracting its capabilities for broader audiences. This technical lineage may give Cowork more robust agentic behavior from the start.
Claude Code has generated significant enthusiasm among developers since its initial launch as a command-line tool in late 2024. The company expanded access with a web interface in October 2025, followed by a Slack integration in December. Cowork is the next logical step: bringing the same agentic architecture to users who may never touch a terminal.
Who can access Cowork now, and what's coming next for Windows and other platforms
For now, Cowork remains exclusive to Claude Max subscribers using the macOS desktop application. Users on other subscription tiers — Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise — can join a waitlist for future access.
Anthropic has signaled clear intentions to expand the feature's reach. The blog post explicitly mentions plans to add cross-device sync and bring Cowork to Windows as the company learns from the research preview.
Cherny set expectations appropriately, describing the product as "early and raw, similar to what Claude Code felt like when it first launched."
To access Cowork, Max subscribers can download or update the Claude macOS app and click on "Cowork" in the sidebar.
The real question facing enterprise AI adoption
For technical decision-makers, the implications of Cowork extend beyond any single product launch. The bottleneck for AI adoption is shifting — no longer is model intelligence the limiting factor, but rather workflow integration and user trust.
Anthropic's goal, as the company puts it, is to make working with Claude feel less like operating a tool and more like delegating to a colleague. Whether mainstream users are ready to hand over folder access to an AI that might misinterpret their instructions remains an open question.
But the speed of Cowork's development — a major feature built in ten days, possibly by the company's own AI — previews a future where the capabilities of these systems compound faster than organizations can evaluate them. The chatbot has learned to use a file manager. What it learns to use next is anyone's guess.

Back to Articles Intel and Hugging Face collaborated to demonstrate the real-world value of upgrading to Google’s latest C4 Virtual Machine (VM) running on Intel Xeon 6 processors (codenamed Granite Rapids (GNR)). We specifically wanted to benchmark improvements in the text generation performance of OpenAI GPT OSS Large Language Model(LLM). The results are in, and they are impressive, demonstrating a 1.7x improvement in Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) over the previous-generation Google C3 VM instances. The Google Cloud C4 VM instance further resulted in: 1.4x to 1.7x TPOT throughput/vCPU/dollar
Lower price per hour over C3 VM Introduction GPT OSS is a common name for an open-source Mixture of Experts (MoE) model released by OpenAI. An MoE model is a deep neural network architecture that uses specialized “expert” sub-networks and a “gating network” to decide which experts to use for a given input. MoE models allow you to scale your model capacity efficiently without linearly scaling compute costs. They also allow for specialization, where different “experts” learn different skills, allowing them to adapt to diverse data distributions.
Even with very large parameters, only a small subset of experts is activated per token, making CPU inference viable.

### 16. `EN` [The creator of Claude Code just revealed his workflow, and developers are losing their minds](data/articles/c2e433d6dc0060138f55b9de14c8a605.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
When the creator of the world's most advanced coding agent speaks, Silicon Valley doesn't just listen — it takes notes.
For the past week, the engineering community has been dissecting a thread on X from Boris Cherny, the creator and head of Claude Code at Anthropic. What began as a casual sharing of his personal terminal setup has spiraled into a viral manifesto on the future of software development, with industry insiders calling it a watershed moment for the startup. "If you're not reading the Claude Code best practices straight from its creator, you're behind as a programmer," wrote Jeff Tang, a prominent voice in the developer community. Kyle McNease, another industry observer, went further, declaring that with Cherny's "game-changing updates," Anthropic is "on fire," potentially facing "their ChatGPT moment."
The excitement stems from a paradox: Cherny's workflow is surprisingly simple, yet it allows a single human to operate with the output capacity of a small engineering department. As one user noted on X after implementing Cherny's setup, the experience "feels more like Starcraft" than traditional coding — a shift from typing syntax to commanding autonomous units.
Here is an analysis of the workflow that is reshaping how software gets built, straight from the architect himself. How running five AI agents at once turns coding into a real-time strategy game
The most striking revelation from Cherny's disclosure is that he does not code in a linear fashion. In the traditional "inner loop" of development, a programmer writes a function, tests it, and moves to the next. Cherny, however, acts as a fleet commander.
"I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal," Cherny wrote. "I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input."
By utilizing iTerm2 system notifications, Cherny effectively manages five simultaneous work streams. While one agent runs a test suite, another refactors a legacy module, and a third drafts documentation. He also runs "5-10 Claudes on claude.ai" in his browser, using a "teleport" command to hand off sessions between the web and his local machine.
This validates the "do more with less" strategy articulated by Anthropic President Daniela Amodei earlier this week. While competitors like OpenAI pursue trillion-dollar infrastructure build-outs, Anthropic is proving that superior orchestration of existing models can yield exponential productivity gains.
The counterintuitive case for choosing the slowest, smartest model
In a surprising move for an industry obsessed with latency, Cherny revealed that he exclusively uses Anthropic's heaviest, slowest model: Opus 4.5.
"I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything," Cherny explained. "It's the best coding model I've ever used, and even though it's bigger &amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it's better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end."
For enterprise technology leaders, this is a critical insight. The bottleneck in modern AI development isn't the generation speed of the token; it is the human time spent correcting the AI's mistakes. Cherny's workflow suggests that paying the "compute tax" for a smarter model upfront eliminates the "correction tax" later.
One shared file turns every AI mistake into a permanent lesson
Cherny also detailed how his team solves the problem of AI amnesia. Standard large language models do not "remember" a company's specific coding style or architectural decisions from one session to the next.
To address this, Cherny's team maintains a single file named CLAUDE.md in their git repository. "Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time," he wrote.

Back to Articles It has become increasingly challenging to assess whether a model’s
reported improvements reflect genuine advances or variations in
evaluation conditions, dataset composition, or training data that
mirrors benchmark tasks. The NVIDIA Nemotron approach to openness
addresses this by publishing transparent and reproducible evaluation
recipes that make results independently verifiable.

with an explicitly open evaluation approach to make that distinction
clear. Alongside the model card, we are publishing the complete

analyze the outcomes independently.
We believe that open innovation is the foundation of AI progress. This
level of transparency matters because most model evaluations omit
critical details. Configs, prompts, harness versions, runtime settings,
and logs are often missing or underspecified, and even small differences
in these parameters can materially change results. Without a complete

We provide an example Space and accompanying code to start the ball rolling on the idea.
Realistic voice generation technology has gotten uncannily good in the past few years. In some situations, it’s possible to generate a synthetic voice that sounds almost exactly like the voice of a real person. And today, what once felt like science fiction is reality: Voice cloning. With just a few seconds of recorded speech, anyone’s voice can be made to say almost anything. Voice generation, and in particular the subtask of voice cloning, has notable risks and benefits. The risks of “deepfakes”, such as the cloned voice of former President Biden used in robocalls, can mislead people into thinking that people have said things that they haven’t said. On the other hand, voice cloning can be a powerful beneficial tool, helping people who’ve lost the ability to speak communicate in their own voice again, or assisting people in learning new languages and dialects.

Back to Articles Project History Acknowledgements Getting Started Today, we are announcing that Sentence Transformers is transitioning from Iryna Gurevych’s Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab at the TU Darmstadt to Hugging Face. Hugging Face's Tom Aarsen has already been maintaining the library since late 2023 and will continue to lead the project. At its new home, Sentence Transformers will benefit from Hugging Face's robust infrastructure, including continuous integration and testing, ensuring that it stays up-to-date with the latest advancements in Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing.
Sentence Transformers (a.k.a. SentenceBERT or SBERT) is a popular open-source library for generating high-quality embeddings that capture semantic meaning. Since its inception by Nils Reimers in 2019, Sentence Transformers has been widely adopted by researchers and practitioners for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including semantic search, semantic textual similarity, clustering, and paraphrase mining. After years of development and training by and for the community, over 16,000 Sentence Transformers models are publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub, serving more than a million monthly unique users.

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles The past year has been all about giving LLMs more tools and autonomy to solve more complex and open ended tasks. The goal of the Jupyter Agent is to give the model the ultimate tool: code execution. A natural way to display multi-step code execution together with reasoning is within a Jupyter Notebook, which consists of code and markdown cells. So we built Jupyter Agent to act as an agent that can execute code directly inside a Jupyter notebook and use this environment to solve data analysis and data science tasks. Think of it like Cursor, but living natively inside your data science workflow.We built a demo of this vision with Qwen-3 Coder, currently one of the strongest coding models. This is a follow-up to our earlier work on jupyter-agent (v1).
While large models are starting to show useful behavior, the key question is how we can continue improving them. To this end, we focus on strengthening smaller models to perform well on agentic data science tasks as they currently struggle to compete with the large models.
The goal of this project is to build a pipeline to first generate high-quality training data, then fine-tune an existing small model, and finally evaluate whether the model's performance improves on relevant benchmarks.

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles Future of AI Most current AI benchmarks focus on answering questions about the past, either by testing models on existing knowledge (in a static manner, such as HLE or GPQA, or augmented, like BrowseComp or GAIA) or previously solved problems (like PaperBench, DABStep, or most coding evaluations). However, we believe that more valuable AI, and ultimately AGI, will be distinguished by its ability to use this past to forecast interesting aspects of the future, rather than merely reciting old facts.
Forecasting future events is a complex and holistic task: it requires sophisticated reasoning, synthesis, weighing probabilities and genuine understanding, rather than pattern matching against or searching existing information. Evaluating models on their ability to predict future outcomes, whether in science, economics, geopolitics, or technology tests the kind of intelligence that creates real-world value.
Beyond its inherent importance, this forecasting-based approach also solves many methodological problems faced by current evaluations and benchmarks. Traditional benchmarks that measure accuracy on fixed test sets are inevitably affected by possible data contamination, and without access to the full reproduci

Gradio is compliant with the MCP server protocol and powers thousands of MCP servers hosted on Hugging Face Spaces. The Gradio team is betting big on Gradio and Spaces being the best way to build and host AI-powered MCP servers.
To that end, here are some of the big improvements we've added to Gradio MCP servers as of version 5.38.0. Seamless Local File Support If you've tried to use a remote Gradio MCP server that takes a file as input (image, video, audio), you've probably encountered this error:
This happens because the Gradio server is hosted on a different machine, meaning any input files must be accessible via a public URL so they can be downloaded remotely.
While many ways exist to host files online, they all add a manual step to your workflow. In the age of LLM agents, shouldn't we expect them to handle this for you?

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) extends traditional LLM training by optimizing not just a single-turn response, but an entire decision-making process learned through direct interaction with an environment during training. Unlike traditional single-turn reinforcement learning or offline preference-based methods that rely on static datasets, agentic RL trains policies by actively collecting on-policy data as the agent plans actions, invokes tools, observes outcomes, and adapts its behavior over multi-step trajectories in either simulated or real environments. This interaction-driven optimization assigns credit across long-horizon decisions, where intermediate choices such as query reformulation, tool selection, and execution order directly influence downstream success. Training follows an iterative closed loop in which the agent interacts with the environment to collect rollout trajectories, computes rewards over these trajectories, updates the policy based on observed outcomes, and then uses the updated policy to drive the next round of interaction and data collection such as GRPO or PPO algorithms..

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles The Real Agent Alignment Problem: Benchmarks or Reality? The Need for Interleaved Thinking True Generalization is About Perturbation What's Next? Getting Involved It's been fantastic to see the community dive into our new MiniMax M2, with many highlighting its impressive skills in complex agentic tasks. This is particularly exciting for me, as my work was centered on the agent alignment part of its post-training. In this post, I'd like to share some of the key insights and lessons we learned during that process. The Real Agent Alignment Problem: Benchmarks or Reality? If you've worked with LLM Agents, you've felt this pain: the same model can feel brilliant in one framework and useless in another. An agent might crush a tool-use leaderboard but fail spectacularly at a simple, real-world task. This gap between benchmark performance and practical usability is one of the biggest challenges in the field.
When we designed M2, we knew we had to tackle this problem head-on. This led us to two core, and sometimes conflicting, objectives: Excel on Open-Source Benchmarks. Benchmarks are essential for measuring "pure" capabilities. A benchmark like BrowseComp, for instance, tests for sophisticated search

Back to Articles The Problem The Solution The RFCs Use cases What’s Next With tools like TRL, TorchForge and verl, the open-source community has shown how to scale AI across complex compute infrastructure. But compute is only one side of the coin. The other side is the developer community; the people and tools that make agentic systems possible. That’s why Meta and Hugging Face are partnering to launch the OpenEnv Hub: a shared and open community hub for agentic environments.
Agentic environments define everything an agent needs to perform a task: the tools, APIs, credentials, execution context, and nothing else. They bring clarity, safety, and sandboxed control to agent behavior.
These environments can be used for both training and deployment, and serve as the foundation for scalable agentic development. The Problem Modern AI agents can act autonomously across thousands of tasks. However, a large language model isn’t enough to get those tasks to actually run — it needs access to the right tools. Exposing millions of tools directly to a model isn’t reasonable (or safe). Instead, we need agentic e

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles TL;DR – We’re excited to introduce the beta version of the Retrieval Embedding Benchmark (RTEB), a new benchmark designed to reliably evaluate the retrieval accuracy of embedding models for real-world applications. Existing benchmarks struggle to measure true generalization, while RTEB addresses this with a hybrid strategy of open and private datasets. Its goal is simple: to create a fair, transparent, and application-focused standard for measuring how models perform on data they haven’t seen before.
The performance of many AI applications, from RAG and agents to recommendation systems, is fundamentally limited by the quality of search and retrieval. As such, accurately measuring the retrieval quality of embedding models is a common pain point for developers. How do you really know how well a model will perform in the wild?
This is where things get tricky. The current standard for evaluation often relies on a model's "zero-shot" performance on public benchmarks. However, this is, at best, an approximation of a model's true generalization capabilities. When models are repeatedly evaluated against the same public datasets, a gap emerges between their reported scores and their actual performance on new, unseen data. Performance Di

Back to Articles Enter SyGra: One Framework for Every Data Challenge Why SyGra Matters SyGra Architecture Final Thoughts References When we think about building a model - be it a Large Language Model (LLM) or a Small Language Model (SLM) - the first thing we need is data. While a vast amount of open data is available, it rarely comes in the exact format required to train or align models.
In practice, we often face scenarios where the raw data isn't enough. We need data that is more structured, domain-specific, complex, or aligned with the task at hand. Let's look at some common situations: Complex Scenarios Missing You start with a simple dataset, but the model fails on advanced reasoning tasks.

Back to Articles Risk Rubric, a new Standardized Assessment of Risk for models What we found (as of September 2025) Conclusion Building trust in the open model ecosystem through standardized risk assessment
More than 500,000 models can be found on the Hugging Face hub, but it’s not always clear to users how to choose the best model for them, notably on the security aspects. Developers might find a model that perfectly fits their use case, but have no systematic way to evaluate its security posture, privacy implications, or potential failure modes. As models become more powerful and adoption accelerates, we need equally rapid progress in AI safety and security reporting. We're therefore excited to announce RiskRubric.ai, a novel initiative led by Cloud Security Alliance and Noma Security, with contributions by Haize Labs and Harmonic Security, for standardized and transparent risk assessment in the AI model ecosystem.

Many modern gamepads have adopted a modular design in recent years, from the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded to Hyperkin’s clamp-on X5 Alteron for the Nintendo Switch. However, few of them are quite as innovative as last year’s Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot, which is now on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for an all-time low of $99.99 ($40 off).
Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot Where to Buy: $139.99 $99.99 at Amazon $139.99 $99.99 at Best Buy $139.99 at Turtle Beach The defining feature of the Stealth Pivot doesn’t lie with its drift-free Hall effects sticks or its built-in social notifications — though, those are nice additions. The controller’s main selling factor is a pair of rotating modules, which, when depressed and swiveled, turn an otherwise traditional button and thumbstick layout into one better fit for tackling retro titles and fighting games. You also get a set of programmable back buttons, adjustable trigger stops for a more customized feel, a 3.5mm jack, and the ability to save up to five distinct profiles on the fly.
As for compatibility, the Stealth Pivot works wirelessly with PC using the included 2.4GHz wireless transmitter, or via Bluetooth, which also lets you connect it to mobile devices and select smart TVs. Battery life is limited to about 20 hours per charge, though you can also use it with Xbox consoles via a wired connection, making it even more versatile.

A new Internet-of-Things botnet called Kimwolf has spread to more than 2 million devices, forcing infected systems to participate in massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay other malicious and abusive Internet traffic. Kimwolf's ability to scan the local networks of compromised systems for other IoT devices to infect makes it a sobering threat to organizations, and new research reveals Kimwolf is surprisingly prevalent in government and corporate networks.

L’hiver le plus implacable du XXᵉ siècle Deux ans après le traumatisme de février 1954, la France replonge dans l’hiver le plus implacable du XXᵉ siècle. Février 1956 s’annonce d’une brutalité inédite. Tout commence le 30 janvier : en moins de quarante-huit heures, les températures s’effondrent de 20 à 25 °C. Le choc est violent, meurtrier. Une quarantaine de personnes perdent la vie dès les premiers jours. Le froid s’installe, s’étend, s’obstine. Il ne desserre son étau que le 28 février, après avoir paralysé l’ensemble du pays et une grande partie de l’Europe. À Paris, la température moyenne du mois chute à - 4,2 °C, un niveau digne d’un mois de février à Oslo. Jamais le XXᵉ siècle n’a connu pareil froid. Les sols, gorgés d’eau, durcissent comme du béton. Les cultures d’hiver — avoine, blé, colza — sont ravagées. Dans de nombreuses régions, les champs devront être entièrement réensemencés au printemps. Pour les agriculteurs, la facture est colossale. Des températures historiques dans le Sud Dans le sud, l’épisode prend une dimension historique. Février 1956 devient le mois le plus froid jamais observé depuis le début des relevés, peut-être même depuis les hivers mythiques de 1709 ou 1684. ` Le 2 février, l’air glacial s’engouffre dans la vallée du Rhône et déclenche un mistral d’une violence extrême : des rafales atteignent 180 km/h à Istres, 160 km/h à Orange avec un ressenti de -30, compte tenu des températures extrêmement basses au thermomètre . La presqu’île de Saint-Tropez se retrouve coupée du monde. La neige s’accumule, jusqu’à 60 centimètres, formant des congères de plus de trois mètres. Sur la Côte d’Azur, le décor est surréaliste. À Saint-Raphaël et Antibes, le poids de la neige écrase les serres, ruine les cultures florales et maraîchères. Les dégâts dépassent les 600 millions de francs. La neige tient jusqu’au 15 mars. Dans le sud de la vallée du Rhône, près de 800 000 oliviers sont détruits, certains gelés jusqu’à la racine. Les indemnisations, elles, se feront attendre pendant des années. L’aéroport de Nice ferme à plusieurs reprises. Winston Churchill, bloqué cinq heures sur place, finit par regagner Londres. Le Carnaval de Nice est interrompu par la neige. À Cannes, où l’on mesure jusqu’à 50 centimètres au sol, la fête des mimosas est annulée. Orangers et citronniers sont décimés, certaines plantations disparaissent à jamais, comme celles de la vallée du Loup, près de Grasse. Le littoral de la Côte d'Azur coupé du monde, après la tempête de neige du 1er février 1956 - archives meteo-paris.com Même le Rhône et certains ports gèlent partiellement !! Un léger redoux autour du 5 février laisse espérer une accalmie. Illusion. Dès le 7, le froid sibérien revient avec une intensité redoublée et ne lâche plus prise jusqu’à la fin du mois. La France vit alors au rythme d’un pays du Grand Nord. Les rivières gèlent, les ports se figent. À Tarascon, un bras du Rhône est pris par la glace sur trois kilomètres. Près de Marseille, l’étang de Berre se solidifie à son tour, tout comme un bassin du Vieux-Port à partir de la mi-février. À Paris, le lac du Bois de Boulogne devient une patinoire improvisée où l’on organise un match de hockey sur glace. À Saint-Fargeau, près de Melun, des centaines de curieux viennent chaque jour observer la Seine entièrement gelée. La Saône totalement gelée à 20 km au nord de Lyon en février 1956 - archives meteo-paris.com Jusqu'à -32°C à Sarreguemines ! Les records de froid tombent les uns après les autres : –12 °C à Saint-Raphaël, –17 °C à Marseille et Paris, –21 °C à Lyon, –25 °C à Nancy, jusqu’à –32 °C à Sarreguemines. À Strasbourg, 160 aiguillages ferroviaires gèlent, paralysant une grande partie du trafic. Températures minimales en février 1956 - carte meteo-villes.com 80 cm de neige dans les rues de Bordeaux ! Le 21 février, une tempête de neige isole l’Aquitaine. À Bordeaux, on mesure jusqu’à 80 centimètres dans les rues. L’armée est appelée en renfort. Usines, écoles, grands magasins ferment. La radio devient le principal lien avec l’extérieur. Le maire, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, bloqué à Paris, dirige la gestion de crise à distance pour assurer en priorité l’approvisionnement en pain et en lait. Les congères dépassent deux mètres dans certaines zones de Gironde, notamment vers Arcachon. Sur le littoral, le gel provoque un désastre. Les parcs ostréicoles d’Oléron sont détruits. La mer gèle sur près d’un kilomètre. À l’île de Ré, la misère s’installe : trois cents pêcheurs de pétoncles, venus de Noirmoutier, se retrouvent piégés, affamés, transis. Les enfants mangent des pommes de terre gelées. En Corse aussi, la neige bloque des villes du littoral. À Ajaccio, les denrées sont rationnées : cinquante kilos de pommes de terre par épicier. Les vignobles français, y compris en Alsace, enregistrent des pertes pouvant atteindre 50 %. Le centre de Bordeaux totalement bloqué sous 80 cm de neige... photo exclusive meteo-paris.com La vague de froid ne s’arrête pas aux frontières. Elle gagne l’Afrique du Nord. Les côtes hollandaises gèlent. Des pêcheurs restent prisonniers des glaces pendant quatre jours. À Hambourg, les cargos attendent des semaines avant de pouvoir quitter le port. La Baltique se transforme en barrière de glace, isolant la Suède. En Italie, la neige tombe sans discontinuer pendant cent heures sur certaines régions. Des centaines de villages sont coupés du monde. Près de Naples, 40 centimètres de neige recouvrent les rues, tandis que des chômeurs affamés manifestent dans le sud. À la fin du mois, les stocks de charbon sont au plus bas. Les États-Unis envoient en urgence 140 000 tonnes. Les services des ponts et chaussées redoutent désormais le dégel. Sur la Seine, d’énormes blocs de glace menacent les ouvrages. Le vieux pont de Sainte-Assise est condamné, incapable de résister aux « icebergs » charriés par le fleuve. D’autres ponts subissent le même sort. Le bilan est terrible : près de 12 000 morts en France. Et tandis que la presse commence à proposer des prévisions météorologiques de plus en plus détaillées, le pays accuse encore un retard sur l’Angleterre, où un bulletin météo complet est déjà accessible par téléphone… au prix d’un simple appel ordinaire.

La neige est très abondante à Val d'Isère en Savoie actuellement ! - Photographie : Station Val d'Isère Même si la neige reste timide en plaine depuis le début du mois de janvier sur la France, le constat est tout autre en montagne. Avec le temps très humide et perturbé de ces dernières semaines, la neige se montre en effet particulièrement abondante sur la majorité de nos massifs, notamment en moyenne montagne où l'épaisseur est parfois impressionnante, même pour une mi-février. Nous vous proposons donc un petit tour de nos massifs. Enneigement MOYEN par massif en bas et en haut des pistes au vendredi 13 février 2026 - relevés Météo-France Voici la liste des stations de sports d'hiver les plus enneigées en haut des pistes (source : Meteo-France) : Piau Engaly : 350 cm La Rosière 1850 : 300 cm Puy Saint-Vincent : 279 cm Saint-François-Longchamp : 265 cm Bonneval sur Arc : 262 cm Flaine : 260 cm Alpe d’Huez : 255 cm Praloup : 255 cm Arêches-Beaufort : 240 cm Chamrousse : 237 cm Les 2 Alpes : 235 cm Alpes C'est sur la partie nord du massif que les quantités de neige sont les plus importantes en station en cette mi-février 2026. On relève en effet en général entre 90 et 110 cm de neige en bas des pistes de la Haute-Savoie au Queyras en passant par l'Isère, parfois plus comme au Grand-Bornand (74) à 1430m d'altitude où on mesure 155 cm de neige ce 13 février. Les quantités sont en général comprises entre 200 et 300 cm en haut des pistes, là aussi des valeurs particulièrement élevées. L'enneigement est exceptionnel à La Rosière (Savoie), ce vendredi 13 février 2026 - cliché Alexandra Brochard via @MeteoExpress Attention toutefois, ces quantités de neige particulièrement importantes entraînent un risque d'avalanche très élevé en cette fin de semaine. Plusieurs avalanches notables ont d'ailleurs été observées ce jeudi 12 février sur le nord des Alpes. Le sud du massif n'est pas non plus en reste avec là aussi des quantités notables. On mesure en général entre 40 et 60 cm de neige en bas des pistes dans les stations des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence et des Alpes-Maritimes et jusqu'à 200 cm sur les sommets. La nivôse de Millefonts (06) mesure par exemple 147 cm de neige à 2430 m d'altitude, soit 86 cm de plus que l'année dernière à la même période ! Pyrénées Le massif pyrénéen est également particulièrement concerné par les chutes de neige ces dernières semaines. Que ce soit l'est ou l'ouest du massif, toutes les stations observent d'importantes quantités de neige en cette mi-février 2026. Certains secteurs des Pyrénées-Orientales ont même relevé des quantités de neige qui n'avaient plus été vues depuis près de 30 ans et d'autres ont atteint des records au début du mois de février ! Si les quantités restent raisonnables en bas des pistes (entre 20 et 40 cm en général) en raison de plusieurs redoux plus ou moins notables depuis le début du mois de février, on relève le plus souvent 200 à 250 cm de neige sur les sommets ! Corse Comme pour les Pyrénées et les Alpes, le temps agité et très humide de ces dernières semaines a apporté une couche de neige particulièrement importante sur les massifs de l'île de beauté. Celle-ci est même plus importante que dans certains massifs alpins avec en général entre 30 et 50 cm à moyenne altitude et jusqu'à 250 cm sur sommets de la région, localement plus ! On relève par exemple 277 cm à la nivôse de Maniccia (2360m), 157 cm de plus que l'année dernière à la même date et presque 2 m de plus qu'en février 2024 ! La station de Bastelica dans le Val d'Ese a même pu rouvrir ses portes au début du mois de février après 3 ans sans neige ! Les autres massifs français sont malheureusement un peu moins bien fournis en terme de neige car moins élevés. L'air globalement assez doux pour la période a en effet limité les chutes de neige abondante sur le Jura, les Vosges et le Massif Central ces dernières semaines en plus de quelques journées de pluie jusqu'aux sommets de ces massifs, entraînant un lessivage parfois notable. On ne relève en général pas plus de 20-25 cm sur les sommets de ces reliefs, ce qui est à contrario déficitaire. Encore et toujours des chutes de neige en vue ! D'autres chutes de neige abondantes sont prévues d'ici la fin du mois (et notamment d'ici le 24 février) à tel point qu'il pourrait encore tomber 1 m à 2,50 m supplémentaires en haut des pistes, notamment sur le nord des Alpes et l'Ouest des Pyrénées ! Les épaisseurs pourraient ainsi atteindre localement 5 m voire davantage...

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Une dépression très creuse va apporter des vents forts et de nouvelles pluies abondantes sur la France en milieu de semaine Vents forts et nouvelles pluies intenses sont attendues au passage d'une dépression bien creuse sur la France entre mercredi 18 et jeudi 19 février 2026. Le niveau de certains cours d'eau étant déjà très élevé, cette nouvelle tempête laisse craindre le pire. Un temps restant agité dans les prochains jours L’influence océanique perturbée persiste en cette mi-février. Sous l’effet d’un courant jet survolant la France, de nouvelles perturbations sont attendues dans les prochains jours, avec plusieurs zones dépressionnaires circulant sur l’ouest de l’Europe jusqu’au week-end. La situation nécessitera une vigilance particulière entre mercredi et jeudi. Une dépression secondaire devrait se former rapidement en marge d’une zone dépressionnaire au large de l’Irlande, se dirigeant vers la Bretagne puis vers l’Italie jeudi. Cette dépression assez creuse devrait entraîner un temps très agité sur le pays, marqué par des vents forts et de fortes précipitations. Vents parfois forts, en limite du niveau de tempête Alors qu’un creusement dépressionnaire notable se dirige vers notre pays, les vents vont se renforcer sur une partie ouest et sud de la France entre mercredi et jeudi. Les vents les plus forts devraient suivre une trajectoire similaire à celle de la tempête Nils, mais heureusement, ils ne devraient pas atteindre la même intensité. C'est donc notamment entre la façade Atlantique, le sud-ouest et les abords de la Méditerranée que les rafales les plus fortes sont attendues entre mercredi soir et jeudi avec parfois plus de 90-100 voire 140 km/h sur les secteurs les plus exposés. Ceci restera néanmoins à confirmer d'ici là. Rafales maximales de vent prévues d'ici vendredi matin, selon le modèle météo européen - via Meteociel Des pluies abondantes et une aggravation des inondations Outre les vents parfois forts, il conviendra également de surveiller le risque de nouvelles fortes précipitations au passage de cette dépression sur notre pays. En effet, entre les pluies parfois abondantes de ce lundi, surtout sur le sud et l'est de la France et le passage de la dépression PEDRO, les cumuls de précipitations s'annoncent de nouveau très importants entre mardi midi et jeudi soir, y compris dans le bassin de la Seine et de la Loire. Cumuls de précipitations attendus entre mardi matin et jeudi soir – Modèle européen via Meteociel Or, ces précipitations toucheront des secteurs déjà particulièrement durement touchées ces dernières semaines, secteurs où les inondations sont déjà nombreuses et parfois importantes depuis la semaine dernière. C'est notamment le cas d'une large partie ouest de la France où la quasi-totalité des cours d'eau sont en crue et où la Garonne, la Loire Saumuroise et les basses vallées angevines subissent une crue historique. Carte Vigicrues du 18 février 2026 à 09h56 Les précipitations de ce début de semaine, suivies du passage de la dépression entre mercredi et jeudi, risquent d’aggraver considérablement la situation actuelle dans ce secteur, laissant craindre des crues généralisées et potentiellement importantes. Un coefficient de marée et une forte houle aggravant la situation Et comme si cela ne suffisait pas, ces intempéries surviennent au plus mauvais moment. Bien qu’il ne s’agisse pas de marées d’équinoxe, les coefficients restent particulièrement élevés (96 et 97), et la houle générée par cette dépression profonde pourrait dépasser les 6 mètres de hauteur sur la façade Atlantique jeudi matin. Cette situation risque de freiner l’écoulement des cours d’eau et, par conséquent, d’aggraver encore davantage les inondations.

Crue majeure de la Garonne à Saint-Léger (47) le jeudi 12 février 2026 - photo Geoffrey Bigey &amp; carte de vigilance des cours d'eau en France au vendredi 13 février 2026 au soir Les crues et les inondations concernent déjà de nombreuses régions. Tous les regards sont tournés vers les nouvelles pluies copieuses attendues ces prochains jours, faisant redouter des crues encore plus importantes. Des dizaines de cours d'eau en crue ! La France vit son début d'année le plus pluvieux depuis 10 ans ! Sur les six premières semaines de l'année, le cumul moyen à échelle nationale atteint 152 mm, soit 64 mm de plus que la normale ! Il faut remonter au début de l'année 2016 pour retrouver des cumuls de précipitations plus importants. Ainsi, la situation s'est fortement dégradée au cours des derniers jours, marqués par des pluies très abondantes. Plusieurs dizaines de cours d'eau du sud et de l'ouest de la France sont actuellement en vigilance orange crue et la Garonne marmandaise et girondine est même en vigilance ROUGE ! C'est donc la Garonne qui subit la crue la plus exceptionnelle, sur deux tronçons situés dans les départements du Lot-et-Garonne (Garonne marmandaise) et de la Gironde (Garonne girondine), où l'alerte rouge est toujours en vigueur. Jeudi 12 février 2026, le niveau de la Garonne a franchi la barre des 9 mètres à Tonneins, où a été prise la photo ci-dessous. Le fleuve sort très loin en dehors de son lit et ses eaux recouvrent de vastes étendues de terre. Les pompiers ont précédé à des évacuations durant la journée de jeudi. Crue majeure de la Garonne à Tonneins (47) le jeudi 12 février 2026 - photo Luis Madeiras Le pire encore à venir ? La situation est particulièrement tendue puisque les sols sont actuellement saturés en eau sur une grande partie du territoire français. La carte ci-dessous représente l'indice d'humidité des sols en surface. Lorsque la couleur vire au bleu foncé, on arrive à la saturation. Si les couleurs virent au mauve, la saturation est totale, ce qui signifie que les sols ne sont plus en mesure d'absorber de nouvelles précipitations. C'est particulièrement le cas dans le sud et l'ouest de la France. Indice d'humidité des sols en surface au 10 février 2026 - Météo France Le problème étant que cette séquence fortement perturbée n'est pas terminée, bien au contraire. Dès ce vendredi 13 février 2026, de nouvelles pluies concerneront la France. On attend de nouvelles perturbations actives, notamment les dimanche 15 et lundi 16 février. Ce sont plusieurs dizaines de millimètres de pluie qui tomberont encore sur une grande partie de l'hexagone d'ici au début de la semaine prochaine avec des cumuls dépassant fréquemment les 50 mm dans le sud-ouest et pouvant atteindre les 100 mm sur les reliefs.

La neige fera son retour en Île-de-France ce dimanche 15 février, tout comme sur d'autres régions du nord et du nord-est de la France - Image d'illustration (vue depuis notre caméra meteo-paris.com) Des chutes de neige relativement éphémères auront lieu ce dimanche jusqu'en plaine entre les Hauts-de-France, tout le Bassin parisien et le nord-est du pays. D'autres épisodes pourraient avoir lieu la semaine prochaine. Retour très bref de la neige en plaine L'invasion polaire continentale qui a eu lieu samedi, fut de courte durée, rapidement remplacée par une poussée océanique plus douce. Si l’air froid persiste sur une grande partie de la France ce dimanche, un nouveau front pluvieux traverse rapidement le pays par l’Ouest. Ce front est accompagné d’un net redoux en altitude, mais la pluie est temporairement précédée de neige pendant quelques heures, là où la couche d’air froid sera suffisamment épaisse. Dimanche matin, la Normandie et l’Île-de-France ont connu des chutes de neige moins importantes que prévues, la perturbation s’étant scindée en deux. La neige a principalement touché un axe s’étendant du Limousin aux Pays de la Loire et au Centre, avant de se réactiver sur les Hauts-de-France, la Champagne-Ardenne et la Lorraine dans l’après-midi et la soirée. Évolution prévue des zones enneigées entre dimanche 8h et lundi 3h – (réactualisation de dimanche 6h - Modèle CEP via meteociel) Quelques centimètres, notamment sur les plateaux Ainsi, les cumul de neige ont été revus à la baisse de la Normandie à l'Île-de-France, mais pas forcément ailleurs. Paris n'a par exemple pas du tout été blanchie. Dimanche en fin de journée, les épaisseurs de neige pourraient dépasser 5 cm entre le nord du département de l'Aisne, ainsi que les Ardennes et le nord de la Lorraine. Épaisseurs de neige maximales prévue pour le dimanche 15 février 2026 (réactualisation de dimanche 6h) – Météo-Villes Une semaine à risque sur les régions du Nord et du nord-est Après le redoux de dimanche après-midi, l’air froid reprendra rapidement le dessus sur la moitié nord dès le début de la semaine. Une dépression, déviée vers le sud par l’air froid persistant au nord, devrait s’échouer sur la France entre mercredi soir et jeudi. Les précipitations, sous cet air froid, pourraient se transformer en neige. Il est cependant encore trop tôt pour déterminer précisément les régions concernées. Des chutes de neige significatives sont possibles, avec un risque accru entre la Normandie, l’Île-de-France et toutes les régions situées au nord de la Seine.

Le dernier mois réellement hivernal en France remonte à février 2018, marqué par deux épisodes importants de chutes de neige et par des températures particulièrement basses, atteignant des niveaux qui n’ont pas (encore) été observés cette année. Sur les 95 vagues de froid observées en France depuis 1900, seule une vague de froid a été observée après 2015 et aucune depuis 2020… La dernière, date donc de février 2018... Source : Serge Saka Une première vague de froid au début du mois Entre le 4 et le 9 février 2018, la France replonge en plein hiver. Un puissant épisode de froid et de neige concerne près des deux tiers du pays, paralysant temporairement plusieurs régions. Tout commence le 5 février, lorsqu’une perturbation venue de Méditerranée remonte vers le nord. La neige tombe jusqu’en plaine sur le Massif central, gagne la vallée du Rhône, la Bourgogne, puis atteint l’Île-de-France en fin de journée. Le 6 février, la situation se complique nettement. Un épisode neigeux majeur frappe l’Île-de-France et les Pays de la Loire. Les chutes deviennent soutenues et tiennent au sol, y compris dans la capitale. Les conséquences sont spectaculaires : un record de 739 kilomètres d’embouteillages est enregistré autour de Paris, piégeant de nombreux automobilistes. Au matin du 7 février, le paysage est est blanc sur les 2/3 du territoire avec une épaisseurs de neige remarquables dans le Bassin parisien. On mesure jusqu’à 25 cm de neige localement, notamment à Vendôme, Dreux ou Versailles, et 12 cm à Paris-Montsouris. Le 8 février, le ciel se dégage mais le froid s’intensifie. Sur des sols enneigés, les températures plongent entre –13°C et –14°C localement, et descendent autour de –6°C à –7°C dans les aéroports parisiens. Enfin, le 9 février, une nouvelle perturbation océanique traverse l’air froid et apporte de nouvelles chutes de neige du Massif central vers l’Île-de-France et le nord du pays, prolongeant cet épisode hivernal marquant. La neige des 6 et 7 février 2018 à Paris où il tombe 12 cm - meteo-paris.com et Alexandre Slowik Une seconde vague de froid, intense, à la fin du mois Du lundi 26 février au jeudi 1er mars 2018, un puissant flux d’air glacial venu de l’est, surnommé le “Moscou-Paris”, envahit une grande partie de l’Europe continentale. Il provoque en France une vague de froid courte mais intense, d’abord sèche, puis accompagnée de neige. Un premier épisode neigeux concerne l’extrême Sud-Est entre le 26 et le 27 février, lié à une instabilité débordant d’Italie. La neige tombe jusqu’en plaine et même sur le littoral entre le Var, les Alpes-Maritimes et l’est des Bouches-du-Rhône. Elle atteint Nice, Menton et surtout Ajaccio, qui se réveille le 27 février sous 15 cm de neige. La nuit des 27-28 février est glaciale sur l’ensemble du pays, avec des températures descendant sous –10°C sur près de la moitié de la France, y compris en Île-de-France, dans le Nord et le Centre. On relève notamment –14,3°C à Luxeuil-les-Bains, –13,4°C à Clermont-Ferrand et Nancy, –11°C à Creil, –10,3°C à Orléans et –10°C à Lyon-Bron. La vague de froid se termine entre le mercredi 28 février au matin et le jeudi 1er mars dans l’après-midi par un épisode neigeux plus généralisé, progressant du Sud-Ouest vers le Nord et le Nord-Ouest. Le Mardi 27 février 2018 au matin, Ajaccio, s'est réveillée sous 15 cm, la plus importante épaisseur de neige dans la ville depuis les 25 cm du 10 février 1986 - source twitter et meteo-paris.com A lire également : &gt;&gt;&gt; La neige à Paris et en Ile de France : toute une histoire &gt;&gt;&gt; Vraie vague de froid venue de Sibérie à partir de lundi &gt;&gt;&gt; Retour de la neige annonçant la fin de la vague de froid &gt;&gt;&gt; Chronique météo du début de l'année 2018 &gt;&gt;&gt; La neige clôt la vague de froid et précède le redoux Auteur : Guillaume Séchet

### 7. `FR` [Vers le retour du beau temps (et la fin des inondations) ??](data/articles/42c33b147843878761bcaee76543c20f.html)

Bientôt le retour d'un temps plus calme ? Depuis plusieurs semaines, la France subit l’influence d’un courant océanique humide et perturbé, engendrant des précipitations fréquentes, des vents parfois tempétueux et un temps durablement instable. Jusqu'à présent, il était devenu rare d’enchaîner plusieurs jours de temps anticyclonique sur la France. Les hautes pressions ne parvenaient jamais à s’installer durablement, et le courant océanique reprenait rapidement le dessus. Cependant, une amélioration semble se profiler. Bien que le temps reste perturbé dans les prochains jours, les prévisions météorologiques annoncent le retour de conditions anticycloniques pour la fin de semaine sur la France et une partie de l’ouest de l’Europe. En effet, le courant-jet devrait circuler plus au nord de l’Europe en fin de semaine, permettant aux hautes pressions (anticyclone des Açores) de s’étendre à nouveau vers l’ouest du continent, et donc vers la France pour le week-end. Cela devrait assurer le retour d’un temps plus sec et calme durant au moins 4 jours. Prévision de l'évolution des anticyclones et dépressions sur l'Europe du jeudi 16 au lundi 23 février 2026 – Modèle européen via Meteociel Un temps calme s'imposant enfin plus durablement ? Il est difficile de prédire avec certitude. Si les modélisations de ces derniers jours suggéraient une tendance anticyclonique plus durable sur notre pays, les dernières simulations remettent en question cette hypothèse. Le courant océanique pourrait reprendre de la vigueur dès mercredi 25 février à la fin du mois. Prévision de l'évolution des anticyclones et dépressions sur l'Europe du lundi 23 février au lundi 2 mars 2026 – Modèle européen Cependant, certains scénarios envisagent une inversion de la situation et l'arrêt de ce courant perturbé océanique au début du mois de mars avec la formation d'un vaste anticyclone entre les Açores et la partie nord de l'Europe. Ceci annoncerait potentiellement le début d'une nouvelle accalmie beaucoup plus prolongée sur la France, mais il faudra attendre que la dépression qui viendra peut-être s'isoler sur le sud du pays disparaisse. Les tendances pour le mois de mars indiquent même un temps durablement sec. Bien que nous restions prudents, une telle évolution serait un contraste saisissant avec les conditions météorologiques récentes et une excellente nouvelle pour la gestion des crues et inondations. Si la majorité des modèles convergent vers cette prévision, il est essentiel de suivre l’évolution des prévisions dans les prochains jours, car les tendances peuvent changer à une échéance aussi lointaine.

Après plusieurs journées aux allures de printemps, marquées par une douceur exceptionnelle — jusqu’à 18 °C à Paris le 18 février 1958 — la situation bascule brutalement. Une masse d’air polaire déferle par le nord et le thermomètre s’effondre de 12 °C en seulement quelques heures. Tout le Nord-Pas-de-Calais paralysé après une nuit de cauchemar Dans la nuit du 25 au 26 février 1958, une violente tempête de neige frappe toute la moitié nord de la France, et particulièrement le Nord-Pas-de-Calais. En quelques heures, 10 à 15 cm de neige tombent, balayés par des rafales proches de 120 km/h. D’immenses congères se forment, bloquant routes et autoroutes. Des centaines d’automobilistes se retrouvent piégés dans leur véhicule, incapables d’avancer ou de faire demi-tour. En pleine nuit, des milliers de voitures sont abandonnées en rase campagne. Le bilan est dramatique : quatre personnes perdent la vie. Robert Lamoureux, Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle pris dans la tempête de neige Parmi les conducteurs pris au piège figure le fantaisiste Robert Lamoureux. En route de Bruxelles vers Paris au volant de sa voiture américaine, il se heurte à un véritable mur de neige près de Baisieux. Alors qu’il tente de se dégager, son véhicule s’embrase. Il réussit à s’extraire à temps, échappant de justesse à la catastrophe. Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle vivent eux aussi une nuit éprouvante. Après s’être rendus à Lille pour présenter le film « Ascenseur pour l’échafaud », dont elle est la vedette et lui le réalisateur, ils prennent la direction de Thumeries, au sud de Lille, où réside la famille de Louis Malle. Leur voiture est immobilisée par la neige près de Seclin. Ils ne seront secourus que le lendemain matin, vers 8 heures, par un camionneur, transis de froid. La DS ensevelie par la neige et dans laquelle Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle ont été pris au piège durant une nuit, transis de froid - archives meteo-paris.com Cet épisode marque également un tournant médiatique. À la suite de cette tempête, Paul Douchy, prévisionniste à la Météorologie nationale, commence à présenter la météo quotidiennement à la télévision. Jusqu’alors, depuis le 17 décembre 1946, ce rendez-vous n’était proposé qu’une fois par semaine. Une évolution emblématique d’une télévision française en plein essor, désormais présente dans près d’un million de foyers. Une neige abondante également entre Paris et les régions de l'Est Paris n’est pas épargnée : près de 10 cm de neige recouvrent la capitale, sous des rafales dépassant 115 km/h. Les fortes chutes concernent également l’est du pays — notamment l’Ain, le Doubs et le Jura — où l’épaisseur du manteau neigeux atteint localement 50 à 60 cm. 20 jours plus tôt (le 7 février 1958) l'Alsace connaissant également une tempête de neige particulièrement marquée - archives meteo-paris.com A lire également : &gt;&gt;&gt; Chronique météo de l'année 1958 &gt;&gt;&gt; Notre almanach météo &gt;&gt;&gt; Compte X @Meteovilles Auteur : Guillaume Séchet

Le flux basculera temporairement au nord ce week-end avec un refroidissement permettant le retour de la neige jusqu'en plaine. Notre article fait le point sur les régions qui devraient voir tomber les flocons samedi et dimanche. Bref refroidissement ce week-end Dans le sillon de la tempête Nils, un autre minimum dépressionnaire se creusera vers les Baléares durant la journée du vendredi 13 février 2026, se décalant ensuite vers la Corse puis l'Italie durant ce week-end des 14 et 15 février. À l'arrière de cette dépression, la France basculera en flux de secteur nord dès la journée du samedi 14 février. L'air froid actuellement présent sur la Mer du Nord va donc s'engouffrer sur l'hexagone durant la Saint-Valentin. La douceur cèdera sa place à une ambiance plus hivernale. Température de la masse d'air à 850 hPa (vers 1500m) le dimanche 15 février 2026 à minuit - wxcharts.com Malgré tout, il ne s'agira absolument pas d'une offensive hivernale majeure - et encore moins durable. En effet, une nouvelle dépression gagnera le nord-ouest des Îles Britanniques dès le dimanche 15 février 2026 avec une nouvelle accélération du flux d'ouest sur le proche-Atlantique, gagnant déjà l'ouest de la France avec un air océanique plus doux dès la journée de dimanche. Où va-t-il neiger samedi et dimanche ? La bascule en flux de nord causera le décalage d'un front vers l'est de la France et les Pyrénées le samedi 14 février 2026. En plaine, la masse d'air ne sera pas encore assez froide pour que la neige vienne blanchir les sols. Quelques flocons pourront tomber jusqu'aux altitudes les plus basses en fin de front dans l'est, mais sans conséquence. En revanche, il tombera plusieurs centimètres dès la basse montagne. On peut s'attendre à des sols blanchis dès 400m sur les Vosges, 600-700 mètres pour le Jura, le Massif Central et les Alpes avec souvent 5 cm dans les stations. Il neigera plus abondamment dans les Pyrénées où on attend 15 à 25 cm dans les stations et des sols blanchis dès 800 mètres. Risque de neige pour le samedi 14 février 2026 - Météo Villes La journée la plus intéressante à suivre sera celle du dimanche 15 février 2026. Une perturbation arrivera par les régions océaniques avec pluie et douceur. En arrivant sur l'air froid, elle pourrait être précédée de chutes de neige en seconde partie de nuit et matinée du Limousin à la Normandie et jusqu'au bassin parisien. Selon les dernières modélisations, une petite couche est possible avec 1 à 3 cm (tenue plus aisée sur les hauteurs). Le front perdrait en activité en gagnant la Champagne et la Bourgogne mais pourrait se réactiver le soir sur les régions frontalières du nord-est, où la neige pourrait aussi blanchir temporairement les sols, avant que la pluie ne prenne le relais. Risque de neige pour le dimanche 15 février 2026 - Météo Villes Pour l'heure, il existe encore des incertitudes sur les régions qui seront concernées par la neige et sur l'activité de la perturbation. Dans tous les cas, les flocons seront éphémères et la pluie prendra rapidement le relais avec le retour de la douceur dès le lundi 16 février 2026.

La tempête Nils s'apprête à frapper la France. Elle débutera par l'arc atlantique durant la nuit du mercredi 11 au jeudi 12 février 2026 avant de s'enfoncer en Méditerranée. Dans certains secteurs, les rafales pourront atteindre les 150 km/h ! Tempête de l'Atlantique à la Méditerranée Associée à un vaste zone dépressionnaire, la tempête Nils se présentera sous la forme d'un minimum dépressionnaire qui se creusera au large de nos côtes atlantiques ce mercredi 11 février 2026. Ce dernier s'enfoncera en Manche durant la nuit du mercredi 11 au jeudi 12 février avec un cœur centré autour de 975 hPa. La dépression se décalera ensuite vers le nord de l'Italie. Les vents les plus forts frapperont d'abord l'arc atlantique avant de s'enfoncer sur le sud-ouest de la France puis le bassin méditerranéen. Position de la tempête Nils durant la nuit du mercredi 11 au jeudi 12 février 2026 - meteoblue Ainsi, les rafales tempétueuses débuteront en nuit du mercredi 11 au jeudi 12 février 2026 sur l'arc atlantique avec 100 à 120 km/h, parfois 130 km/h voire très ponctuellement 140 km/h sur le littoral aquitain ! Ces vents tempétueux vont s'enfoncer sur le sud-ouest avec des pointes de 100-110 km/h au sud de la Garonne jusqu'à jeudi matin. C'est dans le domaine de la tramontane et sur l'ouest des Cévennes que la tempête sera la plus violente avec des rafales de 120 à 140 km/h voire 150-160 km/h sur les sommets jusqu'à jeudi après-midi ! Des rafales du même d'ordre frapperont ensuite la montagne corse et les extrémités de l'île. Notons que dans toutes les régions de l'ouest et du centre de la France, des pointes de 80 à 90 km/h (voire localement 100 km/h) pourront être enregistrées. Rafales maximales générées par la tempête Nils en nuit et journée du jeudi 12 février 2026 - Météo Villes Vigilance rouge dans l'Aude ! Ainsi, les services de Météo France ont placé 17 départements allant de la Vendée à la Corse en vigilance orange tempête, débutant en fin de soirée du mercredi 11 février 2026 et se prolongeant jusqu'en fin de journée du jeudi 12 février. L'Aude a été placée en vigilance ROUGE, ce jeudi 6h à 14h avec des pointes de 150 km/h prévues sur la plaine ! Par ailleurs, de très nombreux départements sont en vigilance orange crues. La Garonne marmandaise a même été placée en vigilance ROUGE crue ! Haute-Savoie, Savoie, Isère et Hautes-Alpes sont en vigilance orange avalanches. Carte de vigilance valable ces mercredi 11 et jeudi 12 février 2026 (tempête Nils) - Météo France Avec de telles rafales de vent, il faut s'attendre à des dégâts, en particulier des côtes atlantiques vers le domaine de la tramontane. De plus, cette tempête interviendra dans un contexte très compliqué. En effet, les précipitations abondantes rendent les sols saturés en eau et donc particulièrement meubles. Ainsi, les racines sont moins bien ancrées dans le sol et le vent peut déraciner plus facilement les arbres. Il faut donc s'attendre à de nombreuses chutes d'arbres au passage de cette tempête Nils. Les sols gorgés en eau sont plus meubles et favorisent le déracinement des arbres par le vent À lire également : &gt;&gt;&gt; En pleine guerre, l'Ukraine souffre d'un hiver très froid &gt;&gt;&gt; Le retour de la neige en plaine en fin de semaine ? &gt;&gt;&gt; Les tempêtes mémorables de février 1990 &gt;&gt;&gt; L'épisode de pluies verglaçantes de la mi-février 1978 &gt;&gt;&gt; Notre bulletin météo réactualisé quotidiennement &gt;&gt;&gt; Notre compte Twitter très suivi et référence dans tous les médias !

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
La pluie n'en finit plus de tomber sur la France, causant des crues majeures dans la moitié ouest. expliquer qu'il pleut autant depuis le début de l'année et cette situation est-elle exceptionnelle ? Notre article vous explique. Une circulation atmosphérique atypique Depuis le début de l'année 2026, le courant jet circule à des latitudes plus basses qu'en temps normal. Il a longuement ondulé de la côte est des États-Unis vers les Açores avant de passer par la péninsule ibérique et la Méditerranée. Ainsi, il a permis aux dépressions de s'enchaîner sur la péninsule ibérique et la Méditerranée avec des pluies affectant une grande partie de la France. En remontant quelque peu, ce jet passe désormais au dessus de la France et maintient l'agitation. De plus, ajoutons que les vagues de froid nord-américaines ont dynamisé l'activité dépressionnaire sur l'Atlantique. En arrivant au dessus de l'océan, l'air polaire favorise le creusement des dépressions, qui traversent ensuite l'Atlantique vers l'Europe. Schéma montrant la circulation basse en latitude du courant jet fin janvier et début février 2026 - Météo Villes Ainsi, cela fait maintenant plusieurs semaines que l'activité dépressionnaire est particulièrement marquée sur notre pays et globalement sur tout l'ouest de l'Europe. Sur la période du 1er janvier au 15 février 2026, l'anomalie de pression atteint -19 hPa par rapport à la normale au large de la Bretagne ! Un tel déficit sur une période de 45 jours est spectaculaire et témoigne de l'activité dépressionnaire hors norme qu'a subi la France. Si vous consultez régulièrement votre baromètre, vous avez surement remarqué que la pression est souvent très basse depuis le début de l'année 2026. Anomalie de pression du 1er janvier au 15 février 2026 - keraunos.org Des cumuls de pluie vraiment remarquables Sur les 45 premiers jours de l'année, 39 ont enregistré au moins 1 mm de pluie en moyenne nationale ! Cela signifie que 87% des jours ont été pluvieux en France depuis le début 2026, un chiffre remarquable ! Non seulement la pluie a été anormalement fréquente mais elle est aussi anormalement abondante. La Bretagne symbolise cet excès de pluie avec des cumuls tout bonnement remarquables. Au 18 février, il est déjà tombé 566 mm de pluie à Quimper depuis le début de l'année ! Cela représente 260% du cumul normal, c'est à dire qu'il est tombé 2,6 fois plus de pluie que lors d'un début d'année moyen ! Jamais de telles pluies n'avaient été observées depuis le début des mesures. Sur le graphique ci-dessous, on note l'absence d'accalmie avec des courbes qui croissent presque continuellement. Cumuls de pluie sur plusieurs villes bretonnes depuis le début de l'année 2026 - Le Parisien Autre indicateur qui permet de montrer que ce début d'année 2026 est véritablement exceptionnel : l'indice d'humidité des sols atteint des records. En effet, en date du 17 février 2026, l'indice moyenné à échelle nationale est à son plus haut niveau depuis le début des mesures pour cette époque de l'année. D'ailleurs, il arrive même sur le podium des situations où les sols ont été les plus humides en France, toutes dates confondues. Seuls décembre 1982 et janvier 1994, théâtres de graves inondations, avaient connu une humidité moyenne légèrement supérieure à la situation actuelle. Indice d'humidité des sols en moyenne nationale du 18 février 2025 au 17 février 2026 - Météo France En résumé : la situation actuelle est véritablement remarquable avec des crues spectaculaires générées par des pluies parfois records, elles-mêmes liées à une séquence remarquablement dépressionnaire, tant par son intensité que sa durée.

Alors que la guerre se poursuit, l'Ukraine fait face à un hiver très rigoureux. Le thermomètre chute jusqu'à -20°C à Kiev où les coupures d'électricité répétée empêchent les habitants de se chauffer et mettent la population à rude épreuve. Image améliorée par IA. L'Ukraine plongée dans un froid mordant depuis Noël Alors que les trois premières semaines du mois de décembre 2025 avaient été douces et clémentes, le froid est arrivé brutalement sur l'Ukraine lors des fêtes de Noël. Depuis, il n'y a eu aucun redoux. À Kiev, la température la plus élevée mesurée entre Noël et ce 10 février 2026 fut de +1°C. Au mois de janvier 2026, la capitale ukrainienne a enregistré une température moyenne de -10°C le matin et -5°C l'après-midi. 18 nuits ont franchi le seuil des -10°C, alors que la normale est de -5°C. Avec un déficit de -4°C sur 31 jours, Kiev a connu son mois de janvier le plus froid depuis 2010 !

Les 10 premiers jours du mois ont été particulièrement froids à Kiev avec une moyenne de -14°C durant les nuits et de -7°C les après-midi ! 5 des 10 premières nuits du mois ont enregistré des températures inférieures à -15°C ! D'ailleurs, cette nuit du 10 février 2026 fut bien souvent la plus froide de l'hiver. Kiev a franchi la barre des -20°C pour la première fois avec une minimale de -20,2°C !

Toutefois, l'ensemble de la population est affectée. Comme la Russie attaque les infrastructures énergétiques, les coupures d'électricité sont très nombreuses. Actuellement, la capitale Kiev ne profite que d'environ deux heures d'électricité par jour. Autant dire que le chauffage ne peut pas être utilisé efficacement et que le froid pénètre dans les habitations, plongées dans le noir durant de nombreuses heures la nuit.

Ces dernières semaines, toutes les infrastructures énergétiques d'Ukraine ont été attaquées afin de mettre à mal l'accès à l'électricité dans le pays. L'objectif étant d'épuiser la population en la surexposant aux températures excessivement basses. En ce mois de février 2026, les autorités indiquent que les prochains jours resteront très difficiles en raison du déficit électrique très important, lié à l'arrêt de nombreuses centrales ayant été endommagées.

### 13. `FR` [Vigilance neige pour dimanche, et pas seulement](data/articles/4456f69aadf69276bd5fdd6e788750d6.html)
**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
La neige du mardi 6 février 2018 au soir à Paris 9e (square Montholon) - archives meteo-paris.com Nous avons choisi de vous présenter des cartes précises d’épaisseur de neige prévue d’ici la fin du mois de février, non pas par démagogie (car nous sommes conscients que ces scénarios évolueront dans les prochains jours), mais pour illustrer la tendance qui se dessine pour la fin du mois. En effet, tous les modèles météorologiques prévoient au moins deux ou trois épisodes de neige en plaine, bien que les timings, les épaisseurs et les régions concernées varient d’un modèle à l’autre. Nous avons opté pour le scénario du modèle météorologique européen, car il sert de référence aux prévisions nationales, même s’il est loin d’être parfait. Neige de dimanche : éphémère avec des différences selon les prévisions Les chutes de neige de dimanche toucheront principalement les régions du Nord au Massif central, en matinée, avant de se décaler vers le nord-est l’après-midi. Depuis quelques heures la plupart des scénarios indiquent des épaisseurs plus importantes et suivent le modèle météo européen qui a toujours été plus neigeux que les autres. Les fourchettes basses des météo arpège, européen et Icône indiquent des épaisseurs comprises entre 0 et 3 cm. Simulation de l'épaisseur de neige prévue pour dimanche 15 février par le modèles météo ARPÈGE (français) - Meteociel En revanche, les fourchette hautes du modèle météo arôme indiquent 1 à 10/12 cm : presque rien dans les vallées (et peut-être seulement une neige ne tenant pas au sol dans Paris) et jusqu'à 10 cm sur certains plateaux. Cette possible grande différence sera liée à la température au moment où auront lieu les précipitations, car il fera entre 0 et +1°C. Il suffira donc de sortir de l'îlot de chaleur des agglomérations et de monter sur les plateaux à plus de 100 à 150 m d'altitude pour passer d'un paysage sans neige à un paysage très enneigé. Simulation de l'épaisseur de neige prévue pour dimanche 15 février par les modèles météo ARÔME (français) et européen - Meteociel Nouvelles possibilités de neige la semaine prochaine Cet épisode neigeux sera suivi d’un puissant redoux, mais temporaire. La semaine prochaine, la France se trouvera entre l’air doux au sud et l’air plus froid au nord, au cœur d’un puissant courant hésitant entre une influence océanique polaire et une influence océanique des Açores. Une nouvelle chute de neige pourrait avoir lieu au nord de la Seine mercredi matin, car une dépression pourrait circuler sur ces régions, apportant de la neige au nord de son centre. Samedi 21 ou dimanche 22, une descente froide pourrait également se produire, accompagnée d’une forte instabilité et de possibles averses de neige jusqu’en plaine, notamment entre le Massif central et les régions du nord-est. Plusieurs possibilité également pour la fin du mois Enfin, en milieu de semaine suivante (aux alentours de mercredi 25 ou jeudi 26 février), le courant océanique pourrait être particulièrement vigoureux, mais l’air froid resterait sur le nord de la France, avec des scénarios très neigeux au nord de la Seine. Selon le modèle météo Européen, les deux tiers de la France seraient sous la neige sur cette carte. Il s'agit ici d'un scénario assez isolé, mais qui mérite d'être signalé.

Voiture écrasée par un arbre à Perpignan au passage de la tempête Nils ce jeudi 12 février 2026 - photo Arpy Cod La tempête Nils a frappé encore plus durement que prévu dans le sud-ouest de la France et jusqu'en Méditerranée. On a mesuré jusqu'à 180 km/h dans les Pyrénées-Orientales et une personne a perdu la vie dans les Landes. Jusqu'à 180 km/h : Nils encore plus forte que prévu ! Les services de Météo France avait anticipé la virulente de la tempête Nils, plaçant la Vendée et de nombreux départements du sud-ouest de la France ainsi que la Corse en vigilance orange tempête. Le département de l'Aude avait été placé en vigilance ROUGE dès mercredi après-midi. À la vue des rafales de vent encore plus importantes que prévu, l'alerte rouge a été étendue aux départements des Pyrénées-Orientales jeudi matin. Carte de vigilance en vigueur le matin du jeudi 12 février 2026 - Météo France Et pour cause, les rafales de vent enregistrées au passage de la tempête Nils ont dépassé la prévision ! Dans la nuit, le sud-ouest a subi des rafales remarquables avec 157 km/h au Cap Ferret sur le littoral aquitain ! Ces vents très violents ne se sont pas limités à la côte. Dans les terres, on a mesuré 132 km/h à Toulouse, 134 km/h à Tarbes, 136 km/h à Mont-de-Marsan et 145 km/h à Pau ! Le matin, Aude et Pyrénées-Orientales ont subi des vents remarquables avec 149 km/h à Perpignan, 158 km/h à Leucate et même jusqu'à 180 km/h à Caixas ! Bien souvent, il s'agit de la plus forte tempête dans ces régions depuis Klaus en 2009 ! La Corse fut aussi fortement affectée jusqu'à 185 km/h à Cagnano dans le Cap Corse ! Rafales maximales de la tempête Nils le jeudi 12 février 2026 - keraunos.org 1 victime et de gros dégâts Les vents particulièrement puissants ont causé de très nombreuses chutes d'arbres dans tout le sud-ouest de la France et près de la Méditerranée. De plus, les sols gorgés en eau ont rendu le déracinement des arbres plus aisé. En matinée du jeudi 12 février 2026, la circulation a été fortement perturbée sur de nombreux axes routiers, y compris sur l'A9 où plusieurs pins sont tombés sur les voies. Un poids lourd a percuté l'un d'eux, blessant légèrement son chauffeur. Plus tôt dans la nuit, un routier de 55 ans a perdu la vie dans les Landes, touché par la chute d'un arbre traversant son pare-brise.

Graves inondations dans le sud-ouest durant le mois de mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Le mois de mars 1930 est resté gravé dans les annales pour sa pluviométrie exceptionnelle dans le sud-ouest de la France, où des inondations d'ampleur historique avaient coûté la vie à plusieurs centaines de personnes ! Des crues d'ampleur dramatique Si les crues observées en ce mois de février 2026 sont majeures, celles survenues il y a un peu moins d'un siècle étaient encore plus spectaculaires. En effet, la fin de l'année 1929 se déroule sous un courant océanique persistant avec de nombreuses précipitations et cette tendance se poursuit au début de l'année 1930. Ainsi, les crues se multiplient sur le pays et atteignent leur apogée au mois de mars 1930, notamment dans les régions du sud-ouest. Les cours d'eau atteignent des niveaux records et les vastes plaines sont recouvertes par l'eau à perte de vue ! Ampleur remarquable des inondations dans le sud-ouest en mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Parmi les crues les plus remarquables, celle du Tarn marque véritablement les esprits. Du 1er au 4 mars 1930, le Tarn et ses affluents atteignent des niveaux et des débits historiques, se transformant en de véritables torrents ! Les communes traversées par ces cours d'eau subissent des crues d'ampleur exceptionnelle et la puissance du courant provoquer l'effondrement de nombreux bâtiments. Le village de Reyniès, sur la photo ci-dessous, est littéralement ravagé par la crue du Tarn ! Le village de Reyniès (82) ravagé par la crue du Tarn en mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Lourds dégâts et plus de 300 victimes ! Lorsque vient la décrue, on découvre des villes et villages ravagés par la puissance de cours d'eau devenus des torrents en furie. Dans le Tarn, la commune de Moissac a subi de lourds dégâts. De nombreux bâtiments qui bordaient le cours d'eau se sont effondrés. En plus des dégâts matériels considérables, le bilan humain est très lourd.

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Après l’épisode neigeux de dimanche (qui a finalement été moins important que prévu), la douceur est revenue rapidement. Cependant, de nouvelles chutes de neige pourraient se produire en limite de l’air froid mercredi matin. Un conflit avec l'air froid sur le nord de la France Dès mardi soir, de l’air froid en provenance de Scandinavie descendra vers l’Allemagne et la Belgique, et pourrait toucher toutes les régions situées au nord de la Seine. Dans cette zone, les températures seront négatives, tandis qu’au sud de la Loire, il fera facilement plus de 10°C. Les régions autour de la Seine seront donc au cœur d’un conflit avec des températures autour de 0 à 1°C et des précipitations causées par une dépression en Manche. Ces précipitations pourraient se transformer en neige, notamment en raison de l’isothermie engendrée par l’intensité et la persistance de ces dernières. Dans ce type de situation, tout est possible, car la formation de la neige dépend de la température et de l’intensité des précipitations. L'étendue et la localisation des chutes de neige régions dépendront également de la position de la dépression. Position des masses d'air à 850 hPa prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO européen pour mercredi matin - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Une zone de neige possible au niveau de la Seine ou au nord Depuis trois ou quatre jours, le modèle météo européen prévoit des chutes de neige au nord de la Seine, sur une bande d'environ 150 km de large. Ce secteur est souvent le théâtre de confrontations hivernales entre l’air froid scandinave et la douceur océanique, ce qui peut entraîner d’importantes chutes de neige. Les exemples ne manquent pas… Évolution des épaisseurs de neige prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO américain entre mercredi 00h et jeudi 7h - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Selon les cartes de prévision des épaisseurs de neige du modèle météo européen pour mercredi matin, il pourrait tomber entre 1 et 10 cm de neige dans cette zone. Cependant, cette carte pourrait exagérer les chutes de neige, comme ce fut le cas lors de l’épisode de dimanche matin. Ces prévisions dépendent évidemment du conflit, mais surtout des températures. Il est donc possible que seuls les plateaux situés à plus de 100 m d’altitude soient blanchis. Dans ce type de situation, les vallées connaissent généralement des températures trop élevées pour que la neige tienne réellement au sol. Épaisseurs de neige prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO européen pour mercredi matin - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Le modèle américain envisage de la neige un peu plus au nord Le modèle météo européen n’est pas le seul à prévoir de la neige ce mercredi matin. Le modèle américain, quant à lui, anticipe un conflit à peu près calé sur la même zone, mais avec des épaisseurs qui semblent plus réalistes. Soyons honnêtes, certains modèles ne prévoient aucune neige, car les températures seraient trop élevées pour sa formation. Dans ces situations « limites », les prévisions météo sont délicates, même à quelques heures d’échéance.

### 17. `FR` [Le retour de la neige en plaine en fin de semaine ?](data/articles/203038773fbbd3b8c106341391cf058c.html)
**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Image d’archive meteo-paris.com de la neige du 7 février 2018 Un retour temporaire du froid en fin de semaine Si le froid est récurrent et parfois marqué depuis maintenant plusieurs semaines sur le nord et l'est de l'Europe, la France est au contraire soumise à une influence océanique très perturbée mais globalement douce depuis les environs de la mi-janvier. Ce type de temps très humide mais plutôt doux persiste cette semaine, toujours lié à cette influence océanique perturbée avec un défilé de perturbations sous un air globalement doux pour la saison venu de l'océan Atlantique. Toutefois, la situation va évoluer en fin de semaine. En effet, une vaste zone dépressionnaire située entre les îles britanniques et le nord de la France va peu à peu glisser vers l'Italie, ce qui permettra au flux de basculer au nord/nord-ouest sur notre pays avec l'arrivée d'air polaire maritime. Animation des températures à 850 hPa sur l’Europe du 9 au 16 février 2026 – Modèle GFS via meteociel Ce retour du froid devrait toutefois rester très temporaire. Comme visible sur l'animation précédente, le flux océanique reprendrait le dessus dès le début de semaine prochaine avec des températures repartant rapidement à la hausse et le retour de pluies parfois abondantes sur la majorité du pays. Un risque de neige jusqu'en plaine ? Si le retour du froid s'annonce temporaire, celui-ci ne devrait pas passer inaperçu pour autant. En effet, celui-ci s'accompagnera d'un risque de neige jusqu'en plaine sur notre pays durant le week-end. À l'arrière de la zone dépressionnaire, alors que l'air froid s'engouffrera rapidement sur la France entre vendredi et samedi, le temps devrait rester instable sur une partie du pays et la neige pourrait s'inviter jusqu'en plaine à l'arrière du front principal en journée de samedi, notamment sur l'est et le nord du pays comme souvent dans ce type de situation. Risque de neige jusqu'en plaine en France pour le samedi 14 février 2026 – Modèle ECMWF via meteociel Bien entendu, la situation pourra encore évoluer d'ici là et ceci ne représente qu'un scénario parmi tant d'autres. Néanmoins, on note un certain consensus des principaux modèles de prévisions ce lundi pour le retour de possible de la neige jusqu'en plaine sur notre pays. Ce risque de neige pourrait de plus persister tout le week-end. En effet, on surveillera aussi un risque d'épisode de neige de redoux à la toute fin du week-end avec l'arrivée d'un nouveau front par l'océan, accompagné d'un redoux en altitude mais arrivant sur l'air froid encore présent sur le nord et l'est de la France, ce qui pourrait signifier un risque de neige de redoux/pluies verglaçantes sur certaines régions. Risque de neige de redoux en France pour le dimanche 15 février 2026 – Modèle ECMWF via meteociel La situation conviendra d'être confirmée d'ici le week-end, celle-ci pouvant encore bien évoluer à une telle échéance en fonction du placement exact des centres d'action dans les prochains jours. En effet, le moindre décalage pourrait annihiler ce risque de neige en plaine sur notre pays. Toutefois, à la vue des modélisations en ce début de semaine, le nord et l'est de la France seraient les plus exposés à ce retour temporaire de l'hiver sur notre pays.

D'importantes avalanches se déclenchent, coupant parfois les routes d'accès aux stations. Sur place, les images sont impressionnantes ! Parfois 3 mètres dans les stations ! Les quantités de neige sont actuellement remarquables dans la plupart des massifs alpins, notamment entre les Hautes-Alpes, l'Isère, la Savoie et la Haute-Savoie. De nombreuses stations mesurent des quantités inédites depuis de nombreuses années, du fait de la succession d'épisodes perturbés depuis plusieurs semaines. La couche au sol atteint fréquemment entre 2 et 3 mètres vers 2000 mètres dans les stations, comme l'illustre le cliché ci-dessous pris à La Rosière en Savoie. La station de La Rosière ensevelie sous plusieurs mètres de neige le mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Météo Tarentaise Dans les stations, la vie est perturbée par ces quantités de neige remarquables.

### 19. `FR` [Et si le mois de mars était très sec ?](data/articles/aac5a19ab7024e4cd2ddde78be4240dc.html)
**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Encore un peu de patience : cette longue séquence agitée et pluvieuse avec des inondations touche probablement à sa fin. Après une période transitoire d'environ une à deux semaines, il semble que le mois de mars sera beaucoup plus sec. Vers le retour d’un temps plus calme ? Depuis plusieurs semaines, la France est soumise à un flux océanique humide et perturbé. Résultat : des pluies fréquentes, des épisodes venteux parfois soutenus et une instabilité persistante. Les périodes anticycloniques durables se sont faites rares, les hautes pressions peinant à s’installer avant d’être rapidement balayées par le retour des perturbations atlantiques. Une évolution plus favorable semble toutefois se dessiner à moyen et long terme. A partir de ce week-end, les modèles météo envisagent le retour de conditions anticycloniques sur la moitié Sud de la France et le courant-jet remontera vers le nord du continent. Cette configuration apportera un temps plus sec et plus calme pendant au moins quatre jours, et surtout sur les régions de l'Ouest et du Sud-ouest, durement éprouvées par les inondations. Le grand retour de l'anticyclone des Açores sur le sud-ouest de l'Europe ce week-end ! Carte de prévisions ECMWF pour samedi 21 février 2026 Une accalmie durable en perspective ? La prudence reste néanmoins de mise. Si les simulations précédentes suggéraient une installation prolongée des hautes pressions, les dernières tendances sont plus nuancées. Le flux océanique pourrait se remettre en place dès le mercredi 25 février jusqu'en fin de mois. Certains scénarios envisagent cependant un changement plus marqué au début du mois de mars, avec l’établissement d’un vaste anticyclone entre les Açores et le nord de l’Europe. Une telle configuration pourrait bloquer durablement les perturbations atlantiques et favoriser une période sèche prolongée sur la France. Il resterait toutefois à surveiller l’éventuelle formation d’une dépression isolée sur le sud du pays, susceptible de retarder cette stabilisation. Les tendances mensuelles pour mars vont même dans le sens d’un temps globalement plus sec. Si cette évolution se confirmait, elle trancherait nettement avec les conditions agitées récentes et constituerait une bonne nouvelle pour la gestion des crues et des inondations. Néanmoins, à cette échéance, les projections restent susceptibles d’évoluer. Il conviendra donc de suivre attentivement les prochaines mises à jour des modèles météorologiques.

**Source:** IoT Business News | **Keyword:** `Business`
Key Insights (AI-assisted):
Tightening integration between intrinsically safe hardware and modern connectivity is shifting hazardous-area IoT from niche pilots to scalable deployments. As ATEX smartphones gain full cellular, GNSS, and sensor stacks, the bottleneck moves from device capability to interoperability with SCADA, MDM, and line-of-business applications. This forces OT and IT teams to converge architectures and security models, particularly on private LTE/5G. The trend reflects a broader move toward real-time, worker-centric IoT in brownfield industrial environments with stringent safety and regulatory constraints. Sensors, standards, and operational constraints in hazardous zones
A technician in a chemical plant needs to log temperature readings, check equipment vibration, and photograph a valve assembly. Standard procedure, but in a Zone 2 hazardous area, standard electronics won’t do. The risk isn’t the device itself – it’s what happens if a component fails and creates a spark, or if a surface gets hot enough to ignite surrounding gases.
Industrial IoT in petrochemical, mining, and pharmaceutical facilities comes down to collecting sensor data while ensuring equipment remains intrinsically safe.

### 1. `EN` [Apple’s budget MacBook coming soon: What to expect](data/articles/d95e9934296ec3d2ee791238f40014c0.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple’s MacBook lineup could be in for a major shakeup. The company is reportedly planning on releasing a new, low-cost laptop that can compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops in the budget market. Such a laptop could bring the Mac to a whole new class of users.
The new MacBook may feature an aluminum design in playful colors, an A19 Pro chip, Ultra Retina XDR OLED display, fewer ports, and Apple’s C2 modem. This new, low-cost MacBook could be a very popular one, which means you’ll want to keep track of its developments. Well, look no further. This article will keep track of the rumors and reports of this upcoming product, as well as offer our perspective on the device, so keep an eye on this page for the latest. New A19 MacBook: Release date
March 4, 2026 – possible Apple is scheduled to host three “Apple Special Experiences” on March 4 in the U.S., U.K., and China. These sessions, which are expected to offer media hands-on time with new products, could provide the ideal setting for the budget MacBook’s debut.
Apple’s low-cost MacBook has been rumored for some time, with Apple leaker Jon Prosser describing a new colorful MacBook Air back in May 2021, that never materialised, but over the past year rumors have remerged suggesting that Apple does have something different coming. In June 2025, credible analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, indicated (in Chinese) that Apple would start production of the new low-cost MacBook at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025 or in the early stage of the first quarter of 2026. It’s worth emphasising that those dates refer to the manufacturing process rather than the announcement or shipping timeframe. If production began in October 2025 then it’s plausible that the budget MacBook will arrive in early 2026, potentially unveiled at a spring event, or in the run up to Apple’s March 4 ‘Experience’. In November, 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning to release a “low-cost laptop to rival Chromebooks and Windows PCs” in the first half of 2026. He said it was currently in testing at Apple and “in early production with overseas suppliers.”
On February 8, 2026, Gurman reported that the low-cost MacBook will be available “in the first half of the year.” He did not offer any specifics. And then, on February 15, he wrote that Apple’s long-rumored low-cost MacBook is expected to arrive “as early as March,” with a design that defies its price tag. What will the new MacBook be called? MacBook (probably)
No reports have been made about the official name of the laptop, but you can assume it won’t be part of the MacBook Air line. It’s being referred to as the A18 or A19 Pro MacBook, based on the chip it could have. Apple could simply call it “MacBook,” reviving the name of the discontinued 12-inch MacBook that was targeted at a similar market. Apple last updated the MacBook in 2017.
Foundry New A19 MacBook: Design
Playful colors
Aluminum chassis (not plastic) According to Mark Gurman (in February 2026), Apple’s low-cost MacBook will have a design that defies its price tag. Apple’s goal with this laptop is to make it affordable compared to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, and one way to cut costs is to make a plastic case instead of an aluminum one. However, since Apple is working to make its products carbon-neutral, it’s doubtful that it would use plastic, preferring to use aluminum or some other recyclable or carbon-free material. Therefore, it is no surprise that the new MacBook, according to Gurman, will have an aluminum chassis. There will be a new manufacturing process “designed to be both faster and more cost-effective than the one used with Apple’s current laptops,” according to Gurman. Along with the aluminum shell, Gurman reports that the new MacBook will be available in “playful colors.”
The following colours are indicated: yellow, light green, blue, silver, dark gray, and pink. Which, in the case of yellow, green and blue, does seem to match the logo Apple designed for the invites to the special events on March 4. Apple Back in June 2023 analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested the following colors: silver, blue, pink, and yellow. A19 Pro MacBook: Display
12.9-inch display – rumored
Apple currently uses a Liquid Retina (LED-backlit display with IPS technology) display in the MacBook Air, an upgrade over the original Retina displays Apple last used with the 13-inch MacBook Pro in 2022. It’s possible Apple could revert to a Retina display with squared-off corners for the A19 Pro MacBook, though it’s more likely that Apple shaves cost by using a smaller display.
On August 11, DigiTimes reported that the laptop will have a 12.9-inch display, slightly smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air. New A19 MacBook: Processor
iPhone chip: A19 Pro or A18 Pro – expected
Another way to meet the pricing goals for this new MacBook is to use a chip that isn’t as robust as the chips used in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. When Kuo first discussed the budget MacBook in his June 2025 report, he stated that Apple will use an A18 Pro, the same chip that was in the iPhone 16 Pro. Now that the A19 arrived with the iPhone 17 this is probably the more likely chip. about what the iPhone 17 can tell us about the MacBook that could use the same chip in: Is Apple’s rumored cheap MacBook hiding in plain sight? The A-series chips are used in iPhones, while M-series chips are in Macs. Both chip families are based on the same general architecture, but the M chips generally offer more processing power.
An A19 Pro (and A18 Pro) can technically do everything an M-series chip can, but it will be slower. When comparing Geekbench 6 benchmarks, the A18 Pro offered single-core performance that’s on par with the M3. However, because the A18 Pro has only 6 CPU cores, its multi-core performance is slightly behind the M1, which has 8 CPU cores. If Apple keeps everything the same, an A18 Pro MacBook will perform like an M1 MacBook Air, which, for a lot of people, has more than enough processing power. Should Apple use an A19 Pro we can expect something even better. It will draw comparison with the iPad models that are powered by Mac chips, though. MacRumors reported, in December 2025, that references to an A18 Pro MacBook appeared in a set of leaked Apple files.
New A19 MacBook: Connectivity
Apple is using its own wireless networking chip, the N1 in the iPhone 17, bringing Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 7, and Thread. It’s likely the same chips will make their way into the A19 Pro MacBook. There’s also a chance this new Mac will have cellular connectivity using Apple’s C1, C1X or yet to launch C2 modem. The C2 is likely to support mmWave. Aside from this, it’s rumored that the budget MacBook will have fewer USB ports than the MacBook Air (which has two USB-C and a magsafe charging port). This low-cost MacBook may not support Thunderbolt. New A19 MacBook: Camera
No camera?
It’s also possible that Apple opts not to include a built-in camera. Over the past several years, Apple has promoted the Mac’s Continuity Camera feature that lets you use an iPhone as a Mac webcam, as well as the upcoming macOS Tahoe Magnifier app. Apple could promote this as a webcam solution. This would be a drastic change, since it’s been a long time since Apple shipped a laptop without a camera, but it could be a possibility in order to meet the company’s price goal. New A19 MacBook: Performance Results are expressed as Geekbench scores. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. We don’t yet have the benchmarks for the A19 Pro, but the A18 Pro has 8GB of RAM, which Apple has said is the bare minimum required to run Apple Intelligence features. So, this new laptop will have at least 8GB of RAM and possibly 16GB, like the other MacBook models. Since the iPhone doesn’t offer RAM upgrades, we don’t know what Apple could charge for extra memory.
As for graphics performance, the A18 Pro has a 6-core GPU, and its Metal score in Geekbench 6’s Compute benchmark is similar to that of the M1 found in the MacBook Air. It’s not a cutting-edge performer, but it’ll handle everyday tasks without any issues. Since Apple’s other MacBooks all start at 256GB of storage, it’s nearly certain this model will come with 256GB of storage as well. New A19 MacBook: Price
The cheapest laptop Apple sells is the $999 MacBook Air. However, Walmart still sells the M1 MacBook Air with a 256GB SSD for $649 and as low as $599. The A19 Pro MacBook has been thought of as a replacement for this Walmart model, though it’s hard to believe it would be that cheap. A price that falls between $729 and $849 seems like it would fit into the MacBook lineup.
There are claims that the low-cost MacBook could start at $599, which could allow Apple to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops. Gurman reports that the new laptop will cost “well under $1,000.”
Our estimation would be around the middle of those two figures, around $749. @macworld.com A cheap MacBook…or something else. A rumor says that Apple is going to release a cheap laptop, but what if it’s actually the long-rumored iPad/Mac hybrid we’ve heard about?

### 2. `EN` [No, Apple won’t drop USB-C from the iPhone 18](data/articles/35940d125bc3496954dcdb09c3e96172.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Most iPhone fans are currently focused on the imminent launch of the iPhone 17e, which could be here in a matter of days. But one dubious rumor doing the rounds on social media right now concerns a flagship phone from the next generation. It’s just a shame that it’s almost certainly wrong.
This TikTok video, which at the time of writing has been viewed more than 17 million times, purports to show the charging port of the iPhone 18. (Or “iPhone18,” as it’s labelled by the clearly knowledgeable maker.) But rather than the USB-C port, which has been used on all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 15 in 2023, the animation shows something more akin to the MagSafe connector that appears on newer MacBooks. This video might look cool, but it’s not going to happen. TikTok The charging cable, which has a rather nice black braided cord, attaches via a magnetic connection. When it’s in place a green LED lights up on the charger head, and a small green lightning bolt is shown at the bottom of the previously blank phone screen. (Never mind that iPhones don’t behave like this; it’s the least of our worries.) It looks very similar to the MagSafe cable on my 2021 MacBook Pro, except with three pins instead of five and a chunkier body.
Now, the video doesn’t list its sources; we don’t get the usual “supply-chain sources” or “people with knowledge of the matter.” It’s just an animation. So in some ways it’s quite difficult to refute: where did this information come from? Who said this was likely? Is this simply a concept that an illustrator dreamed up, like this animation from the same channel showing possible iPhone 18 Pro colors?
Whatever the video’s intention, it’s getting major traction from viewers who think it’s real. A quick browse through a handful of the 9,700-odd reveals viewer after viewer complaining about Apple’s foolishness in doing this, or the impracticality of the design. A few appear to be Android fans mocking iPhone users for their misfortune. I couldn’t find any pointing out that this is extraordinarily unlikely to happen.
Because, as several commenters argue, it wouldn’t be a practical solution. It would disconnect very easily, and unlike on the MacBook, disconnecting easily isn’t necessary to protect it from a specific type of accident. It would annoy customers and accessories makers. And it could create problems with the EU, who mandated USB-C connectors on all smartphones sold in its territory.
What may have happened is that someone has got confused between MagSafe on the iPhone and MagSafe on the Mac. They’re both charging standards that use a magnetic connection to keep the charging points in place, but in most other respects they’re totally different. (For example, the phone’s magnetic connection is stronger so that it remains connected if you nudge the device, whereas the laptop is designed to detach if you trip on the wire.) The iPhone 17 already has the phone version of MagSafe, and the iPhone 18 will too, but that doesn’t mean it will have the Mac version as well. If nothing else, it would be enormously confusing.
Whereas the iPhone 17e is expected to be here in time for Apple’s “experience” on March 4, the first 18-series iPhones won’t arrive until September. And the actual iPhone 18, the cheaper baseline model, might not turn up until the following spring. So bookmark our iPhone 18 superguide to keep up with all the latest news and rumors.

### 5. `EN` [Apple Watch: 15 Tips Every Owner Needs to Know](data/articles/f9893fd9ed2b294e46101c866f494fc7.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple Watch is now eleven generations in, and packed with useful features that are easy to miss at first glance. To help you get more out of your new device, we've rounded up 15 practical tips you might not have discovered yet, including a few that long-time users often overlook. Bounce Between Two Apps On your Apple Watch, double-press the Digital Crown to see a deck of all currently open apps, and turn it to scroll through them. From this view, you can jump back to the last app you were using. Simply tap on an app screen to switch to it, or swipe left on its card and tap the red X button to quit it. Switch App Views If the app grid feels messy, switch to List View. Open the Watch app on iPhone, tap App View, and choose List View. From then on, pressing the Digital Crown will show your apps in a simple, scrollable list. Rearrange Apps You can rearrange your apps so that the ones you use most are closer to hand. Simply press and hold on any app in the grid view, then drag it where you want. Alternatively, open the Watch app on your iPhone, go to App View ➝ Arrangement, and move things around there instead. Ping Your iPhone If you've misplaced your iPhone but you're sure it's nearby, open Control Center with a press of the Side button, then tap the phone icon to make it ping. Press and hold that icon and the iPhone's camera flash will blink too, which can help if it's hidden under something. Skip the Countdown If you're eager to start a workout, the three-second countdown before it starts can be skipped. Just tap the screen when the countdown begins and your workout will start immediately. If you find yourself doing this regularly, consider turning on Precision Start in Settings ➝ Workout. Customize Vibration Strength If you keep missing notifications, go to Settings ➝ Sounds &amp; Haptics ➝ and change from Default to Prominent. This adds an extra tap pattern before alerts so they're harder to ignore. Perform Precision Timing The Chronograph Pro watch face transforms into an actual chronograph. Tap the outer edge surrounding the main 12-hour dial on this watch face to record time on scales of 60, 30, 6, or 3 seconds. Alternatively, select the tachymeter timescale to measure speed based on time travel over a fixed distance. Jump to the Top If you've scrolled way down in an app and want to jump back to the top, just tap the time in the top corner of the screen. It works in most apps and saves a lot of scrolling. Remove Apps Clearing out apps you don't use on your Apple Watch is easy. In the List or Grid View, press and hold on the screen until the apps jiggle, then tap the small x in the corner of the app icon to delete it. This works for most system apps and all third-party apps. Customize Control Center By default, Control Center (accessed via the Side button) gives you quick access to things like Wi-Fi, battery, and Do Not Disturb. But it's worth seeing what else you can add to it that you'd like quick access to. Tap the Edit button at the bottom, then tap the + icon in the top-left corner of the screen. System options such as New Note and Lights are particularly handy, and you might see some third-party options listed too, depending on your installed apps. Speak the Time Out Loud If you're using the Mickey or Minnie watch face, tap on the character and they'll speak the time out loud. Just make sure your sound is turned on. In fact, you can also have Siri read the time on any watch face by tapping and holding with two fingers on the display. Again though, sound needs to be enabled. Customize Smart Replies Smart Replies are handy when you want to reply with just a few words. In the Watch app on iPhone, go to Messages and tap Default Replies to customise what shows up. Then when a message comes in, simply swipe down to pick one of your preset replies. Pause Activity Rings Feeling unwell but hoping to keep your streak intact? In the Activity app, select your rings to access the option to suspend them for the day, or set a pause that lasts until a chosen date up to 90 days ahead. Create a Note In the new Notes app in watchOS 26, you can't modify existing notes on Apple Watch, but you can create a new one by tapping the compose control in the bottom-right corner and speaking your text. Because Notes sync through iCloud, you can refine or reorganize everything later on a device with a physical or on-screen keyboard.

### 6. `EN` [Apple's C1X Modem Faces First Reported Failure in iPhone Air](data/articles/a6f77cdad23f940cd3064110cdb2318e.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
A reported hardware failure affecting Apple's new in-house C1X 5G modem in the iPhone Air has surfaced online, marking the first known real-world incident involving the company's own baseband technology. The ‌iPhone Air‌ is the first iPhone model to ship with the Apple's internally designed C1X 5G modem, replacing Qualcomm's X75 modem used across the iPhone 16 lineup. The transition to Apple-designed modems follows years of development after Apple acquired Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019 and began building its own baseband engineering teams and intellectual property portfolio with the goal of reducing reliance on Qualcomm and increasing efficiency. support thread on Reddit spotted by Wccftech, where the user "itstheskylion" described waking up to find the device had completely lost cellular reception. According to the user, the phone displayed no signal bars and diagnostics indicated a hardware-level cellular problem. The device had reportedly been kept in a case since purchase and showed no signs of physical damage. The user said that multiple troubleshooting steps were attempted, including restarting the device, performing a soft reset, and resetting network settings, but none restored cellular connectivity. The user also reported using a dual-SIM configuration with two different carriers, with neither connection functioning, which suggests the issue was not related to a carrier outage or network-specific disruption. Baseband hardware failures are uncommon in modern smartphones due to extensive factory testing and validation processes, but large-scale production inevitably includes a small percentage of defective units. Apple has historically replaced and collected devices that exhibit unusual behavior for internal analysis, particularly when new technologies are involved. At present, there is no evidence that the issue is widespread or indicative of a broader reliability concern. iPhone 18 Pro, ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max, and foldable ‌iPhone‌ are rumored to feature Apple's next-generation C2 modem.

### 7. `EN` [Apple iPhone 17e: Release date, specs, features &amp; price – what to expect](data/articles/e59ae439dc0a05fff88cf6d10774b5ca.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple launched a new series of iPhones at the end of 2025: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, as well as a brand new iPhone Air, but there was no new iPhone 17e for those hoping for an update to the budget iPhone.
This wasn’t a surprise: Apple released the iPhone 16e in February 2025 to replace the iPhone SE, so an update to the iPhone “e” series phones wasn’t expected to arrive until early 2026.
If you’re considering buying an iPhone 17e, this is the place to keep up to date on its development. We’ll keep track of the latest reports and provide our analysis to help you decide if the iPhone 17e is the right phone for you.
What’s new since the last update to this article: It’s a year since the iPhone 16e launch on February 19 2025, will the iPhone 17e arrive today? Probably not, but it’s likely to arrive before, or on, March 4. At a glance: iPhone 17e vs iPhone 16e Specification / FeatureiPhone 16eiPhone 17e Launch / ReleaseFebruary 2025March 4 (Possible)

Charging SpeedsStandard Qi wireless (~7.5 W)Faster MagSafe (~20-25 W) (probably) Like the iPhone 16e and the iPhone Air, the iPhone 17e will likely have a single back camera. Foundry | Alex Walker-Todd iPhone 17e: Release date
March 4 launch – possible The iPhone 16e arrived on February 19, 2025, so there was some hope that Apple could introduce its replacement on February 19 a year later… With that date now here it’s looking unlikely. However, there is an “Apple Special Experience” coming up on March 4, 2026, with media being invited to meet Apple execs in at least three global locations. It’s generally thought these meetings will tie to new Apple product launches. There are a number of other new product launches expected including a refreshed iPad Air, new entry-level iPad, M5 MacBook Air, M5 Pro/MaxMacBook Pro, and a brand new low cost MacBook.
An event on March 4 – even if Apple isn’t referring to it as an event – is good timing for Apple to launch the new iPhone 17e because it is right in the middle of the Mobile World Congress. According to various reports, the iPhone 17e has entered test production runs to prepare it for a spring 2026 release.
A rumor in early January said the iPhone 17e will go into production following CES (which ended January 9). This is unsurprising, as it follows the same pattern as the iPhone 16e. iPhone 17e: Specs: What’s new for the iPhone 17e
A19 with one fewer GPU than iPhone 17 – likely
MagSafe support – likely
C1X modem – possible
256GB SSD – possible
Apple’s decision to introduce the iPhone 16e in February 2025 represented a significant shift in its product strategy, moving away from the sporadic release cycle of the iPhone SE toward a more predictable, annual “e-series” lineup. This transition was driven by several strategic imperatives, ranging from the necessity of supporting new AI technologies to the desire to test in-house hardware components in a lower-risk environment. To maintain a starting price of $599 while including the high-end A18 chip, Apple made several calculated omissions that differentiate the 16e from the standard iPhone 16. The iPhone 17e is expected to address some of the shortcomings of the iPhone 16e with a few key design refinements (a Dynamic Island is rumored), more storage at the entry-level, MagSafe support and an updated processor (the A19).
Processor: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and others have reported that the iPhone 17e will have an A19 chip, which is no real surprise. If this is the case, it may be a slightly less powerful than the A19 chip used by the iPhone 17. Apple uses binned chips in the “e” series, so Tte A18 in the iPhone 16e has one fewer GPU core than the A18 in the standard iPhone 16; and the A19 in the iPhone 17e will likely have one fewer GPU core than the iPhone 17.
MagSafe: A December 2025 report in The Information claimed that Apple will add MagSafe support to the iPhone 17e, one of the features that is notably missing from the 16e. When we reviewed the 16e, the lack of MagSafe was one of its major shortcomings. A Macworld source in February 2026 claimed that the iPhone 17e will feature 25W MagSafe wireless charging.
Modem: Apple’s C1 modem first appeared in the iPhone 16e, and rumors suggest the iPhone 17e will use the same modem. However, it could take the newer C1X modem as found in the iPhone 17 series, which is apparently two times faster than the C1 while using 30% less energy.
Storage: There are suggestions that the iPhone 17e could follow the iPhone 17 with 256GB at the starting point, up from 128GB. However, in February 2026 Apple leaker, John Prosser said he expects the baseline storage to stay at 128GB. iPhone 17e: How the iPhone 17e display will be different
Dynamic Island instead of notch – possible Notch vs Dynamic Island.
David Price / Foundry Screen size: The iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch screen, which is larger than that of the iPhone 16 (6.1-inch). The iPhone 17e is not expected to get a bigger screen. It will likely sport a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate, the same as the iPhone 16e. Dynamic Island: Digital Chat Station reported in August 2025 that the display will have a Dynamic Island – a change from the notch on the iPhone 16e.
OLED: In December 2025, Korean website, The Elec reported that BOE will provide OLED displays to Apple for the iPhone 17e. BOE also provided OLEDs for the iPhone 16e. Samsung Display and LG Display are expected to also provide 17e displays. Bezels: The display, according to The Elec, will have thinner bezels than the 16e. iPhone 17e: Cameras
18MP front camera with square sensor – likely
The iPhone 17e will likely continue to have a single 48MP camera on the back but the 12MP camera on the front (as seen on the iPhone 16e) could get an update in line with the iPhone 17 series). The front-facing cameras across the iPhone 17 range have all been updated to 18MP, so it is possible that the iPhone 17e will see the same update to the selfie camera. If so, it will also include a square sensor capable of taking photos in any orientation without requiring the user to rotate the phone. The notch may be replaced by the Dynamic Island in the iPhone 17e. Foundry | Alex Walker-Todd iPhone 17e: Design &amp; Colors
Digital Island likely to be only visible external change
Colors: There have been no reports relating to the iPhone 17e’s colors. The iPhone 16e is available in black or white, and we expect the same for the iPhone 17e.
Design: No changes are expected for the design, although, as mentioned above, the new iPhone 17e could have a Digital Island instead of the notch at the top of the screen. There is a possibility that the there could be thinner bezels than the 16e, according to The Elec. iPhone 17e: Price
Starting at $599
A January 2026 report on Wccftech suggests that Apple has been able to reduce costs for the new iPhone 17e, so that the price won’t increase. This is thanks to lower costs for the OLED panels Apple is using. The iPhone 16e starts at $599/£599, and Apple is expected to price the iPhone 17e at $599 as well, though no reports have been made so far. Tariffs and production cost increases may affect the price, but since the “e” series is considered Apple’s lowest-priced iPhone, the price would not exceed that of the iPhone 17, which starts at $799, and the iPhone 16, whose price has been reduced to start at $699.

### 8. `EN` [Report: Meta Revives Smartwatch Plans to Take On Apple Watch](data/articles/7ad34972812c858dde7d3ba14348e393.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Meta is set to release its first smartwatch this year featuring health-tracking and built-in Meta AI, reports The Information. The smartwatch, which would compete directly with Apple Watch and other brands, is the result of a revived project that Meta canceled in 2022 amid broader spending cuts at its Reality Labs hardware division. The original project involved plans to release three different camera-equipped watch models, but it doesn't sound like they will be part of the company's future product lineup. The new watch is code-named "Malibu 2." include facial recognition – and it sounds like they will almost definitely appear before a pair of mixed reality glasses that the company has also been developing. Internally code-named "Pheonix," the MR glasses are said to have been delayed until 2027. Meta executives are said to have grown concerned that launching too many devices in quick succession could confuse customers, hence the delay. Last year, the Facebook parent company launched its Ray-Ban Display AR glasses, which apparently proved so popular that Meta had to delay an international rollout. Those glasses use a neural wristband for its gestural interface, so it's possible the new smartwatch could potentially take over those controls. Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is developing rival smart glasses, an AI pin, and AirPods with cameras, all of which will connect to the iPhone and will interface with the smarter version of Siri that's in the works.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld According to rumors, 2026 is shaping up to be a huge year for the Mac, starting in just a couple of weeks with Apple’s first event (or “experience”) of the year. Along with the usual faster chips, Apple reportedly has new tricks up its sleeve in 2026, with several new features that will have Mac users everywhere saying, “Finally!” Here are four major overdue announcements we expect to arrive this year.
A budget MacBook
iPhone fans have long pined for a truly affordable MacBook priced below the $999 MacBook Air that isn’t just an older model with a cut-rate price. That dream machine may finally arrive in just two short weeks. On March 4, Apple will hold a series of “experiences” in New York, London, and Shanghai, and the star is expected to be the first-ever low-cost MacBook. After tackling the mid-range market with the MacBook Air, Apple reportedly wants to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops, with a new laptop that could be as cheap as $599. Apple will reportedly use an A18 Pro or A19 Pro iPhone chip, and it will likely have a smaller screen than the Air and possibly fewer USB ports. But it will be powerful enough for everyday tasks and light work. For a lot of users, that’s all that’s needed.
MacBooks with OLED displays

### 10. `EN` [Could Apple Demo Immersive F1 on Vision Pro at Its March 4 Event?](data/articles/b15eaab55da86f0c3ee9fb5d11f5e314.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple's upcoming March 4 media event could include a demo of immersive Formula 1 content on Apple Vision Pro, Daring Fireball's John Gruber has suggested. The timing appears to be what's sparked the idea. The 2026 F1 season kicks off in Australia on March 8, just four days after the "Apple Experience" set to be held in New York, London, and Shanghai. last October, and the company has already been experimenting with live immersive sports on Vision Pro with a limited slate of Los Angeles Lakers games this season. If Apple has plans to stream F1 races live on Vision Pro with some level of immersion, March 4 would likely be a great opportunity to show it off to the press. To be clear, there are no little birdies tweeting into Gruber's ear on this one – he's quick to acknowledge this is pure speculation shared with him by a reader. "Could just be a total coincidence that the Formula 1 season is starting the weekend after this event," he says. "But it seems worth noting." Apple has said that further details on production and "new ways to enjoy F1 content" across its products will be shared in the coming months. March 4 could fit that timeline nicely, or it could of course be nothing at all. Apple is widely expected to unveil several new products in the near future, including the iPhone 17e, MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, an eighth-generation iPad Air, and a 12th-generation iPad. A refreshed Studio Display and an all-new low-cost MacBook powered by the A18 chip are also possible, alongside updates to the Apple TV and HomePod mini. Tag: John Gruber

iPhone Gift Guide: iPhone power banks
Hands up if your iPhone has never run out of juice during the day when you are far from a convenient power socket. Yeah, right.
Apple used to make a special Smart Battery Case for the iPhone but stopped selling these when it added MagSafe magnetic wireless charging to the iPhone 12 and later. It then sold its own MagSafe Battery Case but stopped making these when it launched the iPhone 15. But fear not, as there are some great MagSafe power banks out there that clamp onto the back of your iPhone (12/13/14/15/16/17) and can recharge the phone for long enough that you can reach a power source.
Of course, Macworld has tested many of them and picked the best MagSafe power banks, but here are a few of our favorites. Pros
Huge 10000mAh battery capacity
Built-in USB-C cable
Wireless or 30W wired charging Retailer Price View Deal Product Price The Anker Zolo Magnetic Power Bank is available in four colors—black, blue, pink or white—and uses MagSafe to magnetically stick to the back of your iPhone when you need a power boost. In our tests, it recharged an iPhone twice over with its 10000mAh battery capacity. Better still, it features its own built-in USB-C cable for charging up the battery pack or wired-charging the iPhone 15/16/17 families that have a USB-C port rather than Lightning. Using the cable rather than MagSafe will charge an iPhone 15/16/17 at an impressive 30W. MagSafe wireless charging is slower at 7.5W but it will still rescue a fading iPhone 12 or later—or you can supply your own Lightning cable (or USB-C for iPhone 15 users) and connect with a wire. It also features a handy kickstand. Anker If you have an older (pre-15) iPhone, then you need a Lightning cable but the non-magnetic Anker Zolo Power Bank has both, meaning it will still be relevant when you upgrade to a USB-C iPhone. And of course you can use the USB-C cable to charge the power bank itself. If you have a family with both USB-C (15/16/17) and Lightning (14 and earlier) iPhones this will suit all models. There’s a handy digital battery-level display, too. This version of the Zolo doesn’t feature wireless charging. Anker With no built-in cable but a fast 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging pad, a third option is the Anker MagGo 10K Slim Power Bank (above), which is the slimmest 10K high-capacity wireless power bank we have tested—perfect for carrying with you in a bag for emergencies when your iPhone starts to fade and you are miles from a power socket or have forgotten your charger and cable. Pros
5000mAh battery capacity
Color options

A simple charger sounds like a boring present but we think any iPhone users would be delighted to receive one of these beauties now that Apple no longer includes one in the box with new iPhones. And which iPhone users couldn’t do with at least one more spare charger at home or in the office—or a special one for travel?
An iPhone charger should be rated at least 20W, and we’d recommend 30W or better as newer iPhones can accept higher wattages than even Apple admits. A 30W charger can handle an iPad Pro and has just enough to power up even a 13-inch MacBook Air.
For more details and options, read our Best Picks roundup of the best iPhone chargers. Further down we recommend some multi-device chargers that might make more of an impact come unwrapping day. Pros

Its 30W power is enough to fast charge even the biggest iPhone. You’ll need a USB-C to USB-C cable to charge an iPhone 15/16/17 and USB-C to Lightning cable for older iPhones.

Using both ports, one will give 25W and the other 20W—enough for a reasonably fast charge. It’s a great compact choice for homes with a couple of devices in need of a power boost. iPhone Gift Guide: MagSafe chargers
While charging using a USB-C cable (USB-C to Lightning for older iPhones, and USB-C to USB-C for the iPhone 15 and later) from your charger is the fastest way to charge an iPhone, more convenient is wireless charging. Since the iPhone 12, wireless charging has become more efficient and therefore faster with Apple’s MagSafe technology that magnetically clamps the iPhone more securely to the wireless charger.
You can buy a simple USB-C to MagSafe charging pad, like Apple’s $39/£39 MagSafe Charger or a third-party alternative, or a multi-device charger that includes a MagSafe charger for iPhone plus a charger for AirPods or Apple Watch.

If you thought that chargers might be a boring gift, I hope we’ve persuaded you otherwise. But how would you feel unwrapping a charging cable? Me? I’d be delighted as you can’t own enough charging cables, can you? They are always handy. Sure, it’s not a pony or a new TV but it’s easier to wrap.
Older iPhones will need a USB-C to Lightning cable; check out our roundup of the best Lightning cables. Pair one of these with a USB-C charger, see above, for the fastest charging. An older USB-A to Lightning cable doesn’t support iPhone fast charging.
The iPhone 15, 16 and 17 families now have a USB-C rather than Lightning port so you can use the same cable as you have for your MacBook. We have tested the best USB-C cables for iPhones and can recommend these as great little gifts. Pros

You can buy it in black, white, purple or blue and is rated to support 100W so it can be used to charge your MacBook, too.

With iOS 26.4, CarPlay users will be able to use third-party chatbots with ‌CarPlay‌. AI services like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT will be accessible through the ‌CarPlay‌ system for the first time. Apple's ‌CarPlay‌ Developer Guide [PDF] lists voice-based conversational apps as a supported app type starting with iOS 26.4. Apple is implementing a new voice control screen that will let apps provide visual feedback for voice-based conversational apps. AI apps that integrate ‌CarPlay‌ will need to add support for the voice control screen while voice-based services are active. There is a specific entitlement for voice-based conversational apps, and companies that make chatbots will need to update their apps to add ‌CarPlay‌ support. Siri voice controls while in the vehicle. iPhone functions. There also won't be a wake word option to activate a third-party app, so users will still need to open the app to use the chatbot. After an app is launched, the customizable voice control screen will give users vehicle-optimized chatbot experiences. Related Roundups: iOS 26, iPadOS 26

### 13. `EN` [iOS 26.4's New CarPlay Video Feature Shown in Action](data/articles/fd3b527df676acf28f2c69cf2cb6c911.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Back at WWDC 2025, Apple revealed that it was planning to allow CarPlay users to watch video via AirPlay in their vehicles while they are not driving, and the first beta of iOS 26.4 suggests the feature may be nearing availability. There are several new references to CarPlay video streaming functionality within the iOS 26.4 beta's source code. The feature is not yet visible to users, but software developer Thomas Dye managed to get it working to some extent in Xcode's CarPlay simulator on the Mac, and he showed it off in a recent YouTube video (via 9to5Mac). On an iPhone connected to CarPlay, it appears that videos in any AirPlay-supported app can be played on the car's display. In the Dynamic Island, there is a button that allows you to show the video on the iPhone instead, when you want to. The demo also reveals that an Apple TV app will be available on CarPlay, allowing you to access shows and movies from the Apple TV streaming service and your own library. There is also a tab for accessing MLS Season Pass. However, it is not entirely clear if the Apple TV app will actually be this fully featured on the real version of CarPlay. The simulator provides an early albeit fairly clunky look at CarPlay's video streaming in action. The feature will likely be available by time iOS 26.4 is released to the general public in late March or early April, but there is a chance it will get held back until iOS 26.5 or later if Apple needs more time to wrap up development. indicates that automakers will need to implement support for the CarPlay video functionality, due to the safety requirement that the vehicle be parked, so it may take some time for the feature to widely roll out.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
New trade-in data indicates that Apple's iPhone 17 Pro Max has rapidly become the single most traded-in smartphone. According to a new report from SellCell, Apple's latest flagship iPhone has quickly risen to the top of the independent trade-in market, accounting for 11.5% of all devices appearing in the top-20 trade-in rankings just months after release. The analysis is based on SellCell internal trade-in data and secondary market pricing trends gathered from 40 independent ‌iPhone‌ buyers. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max's share of the top-20 trade-in rankings increased from about 5.1% in late November to 11.5% by early February, more than doubling in approximately 12 weeks. 86% of traded-in units were categorized as being in mint or good condition, suggesting many owners are selling soon after purchase. iPhone 16 Pro Max and ‌iPhone‌ 13 sit at 7.2% of trade-ins each. The top-20 devices collectively represent around 47% of all trade-in activity. Trade-in rankings typically reflect a wide mix of devices at different points in their lifecycle, with older models often dominating resale volume due to large installed bases and the natural upgrade cycle. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max's rapid rise is therefore notable because the device only entered the market relatively recently yet has already become the most frequently traded-in model across the tracked channels. The ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max has apparently lost approximately 25.4% of its value since launch when measuring average resale prices for mint-condition devices over a 145-day period. Over an equivalent timeframe, the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max lost roughly 32.5% of its value. This represents more than 7% lower depreciation for the newer model and translates to as much as $95 in additional retained value compared with the previous generation over the same period.

### 15. `EN` [Low-Cost MacBook Expected on March 4 in These Colors](data/articles/f67e38ec21c08df032924b9c7d8ef9bd.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple will announce its rumored low-cost MacBook at its event on March 4, with the device coming in a selection of bold color options, according to a known leaker. Earlier this week, Apple announced a "special Apple Experience" for the media in New York, London, and Shanghai, taking place on March 4, 2026 at 9:00am ET. Instant Digital" said that the color scheme of the Apple logo graphic used for the upcoming "Apple Experience" should match the colors of the new entry-level Mac. The invite graphic shows a 3D Apple logo made up of transparent discs in yellow, green, and blue. The post effectively constitutes a claim that the device is set to arrive at the event. In June 2025, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the more-affordable MacBook could come in silver, blue, pink, and yellow finishes, which would match the entry-level iPad. In his latest newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple has tested a range of playful color options for its upcoming low-cost MacBook, going well beyond the muted tones available on its current laptop lineup. Gurman said the colors tested so far include light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray, although he added that it is unlikely all of them will ship. The color palette would make the budget MacBook the most colorful laptop Apple has offered since the iBook G3 era in the late 90s, which included Tangerine, Blueberry, Indigo, Graphite, and Key Lime. iPhone chip, likely the A18 Pro, rather than an M-series processor. It will likely retail for well below $1,000.

### 16. `EN` [10 Reasons to Wait for Apple's iPhone 18 Pro](data/articles/e28384c919c1fb419b4a06e38475b882.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models at the same time, which is why we often get rumored features months ahead of launch. The iPhone 18 series is no different, and we already have a good idea of what to expect for the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max. One thing worth noting is that Apple is reportedly planning a major change to its iPhone release cycle this year, adopting a two-phase rollout starting with the iPhone 18 series. That means the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and iPhone Fold will be released in September 2026, followed by the iPhone 18 and iPhone 18e in spring 2027. Overall Design iPhone 17 Pro Style Rumors suggest the iPhone 18 Pro lineup will largely retain the same design as the iPhone 17 Pro models. The rear camera system will look identical to the current generation, featuring a raised "plateau" with three lenses arranged in a triangle. Display sizes are also expected to remain unchanged, with the iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max continuing to use 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch panels, respectively – the same dimensions introduced with the iPhone 16 Pro series. iPhone 18 Pro models could drop the current two-tone look of the rear casing found on the iPhone 17 Pro in favor of a more seamless aesthetic. For the next-generation models, Apple has apparently updated the back-glass "replacement process" to minimize the color difference between the Ceramic Shield 2 glass and the aluminum frame, resulting in a more unified appearance. Next-Level Battery Life Thicker Chassis The iPhone 18 Pro Max will feature a bigger battery for continued best-in-class battery life, claims a Chinese leaker. The Weibo user known as "Digital Chat Station" said that the ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max will have a battery capacity of 5,100 to 5,200 mAh. (The iPhone 17 Pro Max has the biggest ‌iPhone‌ battery to date at 5,088 mAh. Apple says it has a battery life of up to 39 hours.) According to another rumor, the body of the iPhone 18 Pro Max will be slightly thicker than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, raising the device's weight to around 243 grams. That would make the iPhone 18 Pro Max approximately 3 grams more than the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which is currently the heaviest model Apple has produced. A larger battery is the most likely cause. Smaller Dynamic Island Under-Screen Face ID? Rumors continue to circulate about whether the iPhone 18 Pro models will introduce under-display Face ID, but reports remain divided on when the technology will actually arrive. The feature would move the TrueDepth camera system beneath the display, eliminating the need for the current Dynamic Island cutout. Wayne Ma of The Information, Apple is targeting a design without a Dynamic Island, replacing it with a single pinhole camera in the upper-left corner of the screen. However, other sources dispute that claim. Display analyst Ross Young believes under-display Face ID is possible for the iPhone 18 Pro, but says a smaller Dynamic Island will still be present. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has echoed this view, reporting that the new models will feature a slimmed-down Dynamic Island rather than removing it entirely. Apple is also said to be testing new camera miniaturization technology to reduce the size of the front-facing camera currently located within the Dynamic Island. claimed the Dynamic Island cutout on the iPhone 18 Pro models will be approximately 35% narrower than it is on the iPhone 17 Pro models. Specifically, they said it will have a width of around 13.5mm, down from around 20.7mm Instant Digital has offered yet another version of events, saying the Dynamic Island will shrink in size, but that under-display Face ID and camera technology won't debut this year. Overall, the consensus suggests Apple may be refining the Dynamic Island before fully transitioning to an all-screen design in future generations. A20 Pro Chip 2nm Process The iPhone 18 Pro models will use Apple's A20 chip, based on TSMC's 2nm process for power and efficiency improvements. A move to 2nm fabrication increases transistor density, which will enable higher performance. The A20 series is expected to deliver roughly a 15 percent speed gain and about 30 percent better efficiency compared with the A19 series used in Apple's iPhone 17 models. Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module (WMCM) technology, suggesting at least some A20 chips will have RAM integrated directly onto the same wafer as the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine, rather than sitting adjacent to the chip and connected via a silicon interposer. This could contribute to faster performance for both overall tasks and Apple Intelligence, and longer battery life from improved power efficiency. C2 Modem Replacing Qualcomm Apple plans to include its next-generation C2 modem in the iPhone 18 Pro models, according to supply chain analyst Jeff Pu. The chip will succeed the C1 modem, which debuted in the lower-cost iPhone 16e as Apple's first in-house cellular modem, and the C1X modem chip in the iPhone Air, which Apple says is up to 2× faster than the C1. The C2 is expected to bring faster speeds, improved power efficiency, and support for mmWave 5G in the United States – a feature missing from the C1 and C1X. Apple's modem roadmap is part of a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on Qualcomm, which currently supplies 5G modems for the rest of the iPhone lineup. The company has been working on developing its own cellular chips for years, aiming for deeper integration and greater control over power management and performance. New Camera Sensor Samsung-Made Samsung is working on a new three-layer stacked image sensor, reportedly intended for the iPhone 18. The sensor, referred to as PD-TR-Logic, integrates three layers of circuitry, which would improve camera responsiveness, reduce noise, and increase dynamic range. The leak comes from a source known as "Jukanlosreve," who claims the sensor is being developed specifically for Apple's 2026 iPhone lineup. Sony has long been Apple's sole image sensor supplier, so Samsung's entry would be a big shift in the iPhone's camera supply chain. Variable Aperture DSLR-Style Apple intends to equip this year's iPhone 18 Pro models with a variable aperture lens, according to reports. Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station claims the main rear camera – what Apple calls the 48-megapixel Fusion camera – on both iPhone 18 Pro models will offer variable aperture, which would be a first for the iPhone. A variable-aperture system physically adjusts the lens opening, letting more light in for low-light shots or narrowing the opening for brighter scenes and deeper depth of field. November 2024 that Apple's iPhone 18 Pro models will get the feature. 5G Satellite Internet Non-Terrestrial Data According to a report by The Information, Apple plans to add support for 5G networks that operate via satellites rather than Earth-based towers as early as next year. This advancement would allow future iPhones to gain full internet connectivity through satellite, not just limited emergency features. If Apple meets the 2026 target, the first devices to feature 5G satellite internet would likely be the iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max, and the long-rumored foldable iPhone. Apple partners with Globalstar for its iPhone satellite features, but there is currently no service that delivers full 5G satellite internet directly to a smartphone, and the report did not specify who would supply it. Simplified Camera Control New Design Apple is reportedly working to simplify the Camera Control button's design on iPhone 18 models in order to reduce costs. The current Camera Control button on iPhone 17 models uses both capacitive and pressure sensors beneath a sapphire crystal surface. The capacitive layer detects touch gestures, while the force sensor recognizes different pressure levels for taps, presses, and swipes. remove the capacitive sensing layer and retain only pressure sensing recognition in the second iteration to achieve all Camera Control functions on the iPhone 18. The simplified version is not about reducing functionality in the button, but about saving money. The current solution is said to be very expensive for Apple and is generating costly after-sales repairs. New Colors Three in Testing Apple is rumored to be testing three new color options for the iPhone 18 Pro models: burgundy, brown, and purple. A burgundy finish would mark the first time the Pro and Pro Max models have been offered in any shade of red, apart from the lighter (PRODUCT)RED used on earlier devices. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max were previously available in Deep Purple, and Apple has never released an iPhone in a genuinely brown color.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Code references in the latest version of iOS point to what might sound like a surprising new feature in CarPlay: the ability to play movies and TV shows in your car.
iOS 26.4, which has just launched in beta form, contains two giveaway strings, both of which mention an important safety measure. “When you’re not driving,” reads the first, “open Apple TV on iPhone and review the privacy information.” While the second reads: “When you’re not driving, sign in to Apple TV on iPhone.”
These code strings were spotted by the MacRumors analyst Aaron Perris, who posted his discovery to Twitter/X. The Apple news site 9to5Mac further spotted five references that contain the words “CarPlayVideoPlayback,” juxtaposed with terms such as “ClimateControls” and “Notifications.”
It’s worth noting that while these snippets point to the feature approaching launch, the concept is not a total surprise. “Video in the car” was originally announced as part of the iOS 26 update last year, and is still mentioned in the CarPlay section of Apple’s developer site.
“AirPlay video in the car enables people to watch their favorite videos from iPhone right on their CarPlay display when they aren’t driving,” the page explains. “Integrate support for CarPlay with AirPlay video to enable this feature in your car.”
That’s the key: it was left up to automakers to authorise and integrate the feature. And up to now, no automaker has chosen to do that, or announced that it intends to do so in the future. But this latest discovery hints that progress is finally being made.

### 18. `EN` [Best laptop power banks for Apple MacBook 2026](data/articles/2944d303396b843aca0d5e717169e4ff.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Many of us are quite used to carrying around a handy power bank to top up our iPhone batteries during a long day away from a power socket, but these pocketable battery packs are usually not powerful enough to keep an unplugged and energy-hungry MacBook going all day.
We’ve rounded up the best portable laptop power banks with battery capacities high enough to recharge a fading Apple MacBook if you won’t be able to plug it into an electrical outlet for some time.
Despite new laptops boasting improved battery life duration, it’s easy for your trusty MacBook to lose power after a day of intense meetings and PowerPoint presentations. No one wants to see the Mac’s “Your battery is running low” warning, especially when halfway through watching a downloaded Netflix series on a long-haul flight.
We looked at seven main factors for recommending laptop power banks: battery capacity, charging speed, total power output, power input, USB ports, portability and safety. For more details on each see below this list of the best MacBook power banks.
Power vs portability
As a rule, the higher the battery capacity, the larger and heavier the power bank. We have included size and weight so you can determine if each power bank suits your traveling needs. Some laptop power banks are built to last in the great outdoors so will feature more rugged IP-rated shells; read on for our reviews below.
There are much smaller, lighter and more portable power banks for phones—check out our recommendations of the best power banks for iPhone. You could use some of these to recharge a laptop but we recommend the power banks tested and reviewed here for the best results when powering up a laptop.
There are some giant power banks, usually called portable power stations, that can keep a family going all weekend, but they are way too large to carry with you on your travels. We have tested the most MacBook-friendly models in our roundup of the best portable power stations.
Macworld Test Score
We test each power bank’s real-world charging prowess by recharging a spent 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro from 0% to 100% (or as far as it gets) and then repeat, adding the two percentages together to create a comparable Test Score.
Which power bank is best for your MacBook in 2026?
We have indicated which models of MacBook we think each power bank is best suited to, but that doesn’t mean you can’t pair any with different MacBooks. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W so owners of that model should look for a PD 3.1 power bank. But even a 13-inch MacBook Air will work well with the higher-capacity power banks. They might not charge any faster, but they will be recharged more times if you pick a high-capacity battery pack. Pros

The Anker Prime 26K Power Bank (300W) is one of the most powerful laptop power banks that you can match with your MacBook. It is a great fit with the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has a battery rated at around the same watt hours (99.6WH) as this power bank (99.75Wh).
There are three USB ports. Each of the two USB-C ports can be used to power at 140W. Attach Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable or the included 240W USB-C cable to the power back and you can utilize one of the 140W PD 3.1 ports to fast-charge the 16-inch Pro. Indeed, with its 300W total output at your disposal you could fast-charge two of the top-end MacBooks at the same time and still have enough juice to fast-charge your iPhone!
Anker claims that you can fast-charge that top-end MacBook Pro up to 50% in 27 minutes. In our tests, we charged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to full power with enough left over to power it back to 25% on the second recharge.
You can recharge the power bank itself to 50% in under 150 minutes using the two USB-C ports at the same time at an impressive 250W.
This is a sophisticated power bank with some tricks of its own. It can be controlled by an app, which gives real-time charging stats (Remaining Charging Time and Input and Output power indicators) and can be optimized to help extend the battery life of the devices being charged as well as its own. You can even use the app’s Find Device feature to activate a sound alert from the power bank when you need to locate it.
Anker also sells a 27K Prime Power Bank, available in either black or gold colors. We prefer the 26K model as it’s a little smaller, performed better in our tests, and out guns the 27K model in total output (300W vs 250W) and input (250W vs 170W).
Who should buy the Anker Prime 26K 300W Power Bank?
Powerful enough to charge two 16-inch MacBooks at the same time, this power bank is a great travelling companion for any of Apple’s laptops. Both its 300W total output and 250W input are top-end for a truly portable power bank.

Although a little larger and heavier than the Anker Prime 26K 300W Power Bank, reviewed above, the EcoFlow RAPID Pro 27K Power Bank (300W) has a hidden weapon in its battle for the best MacBook power bank: a built-in retractable USB-C cable tucked away in its base—saving you from carrying a spare cable around with you and keeping your travel bag neat and tidy.
Like the Anker Prime 26K, this power bank can fast-charge two 16-inch MacBook Pros at full pelt. It boasts the same 200W total output, and has two more USB-C ports—both at a potential 65W—but no legacy USB-A port. If you need a USB-A port, look to the Anker Prime instead. USB-A aside, it can recharge up to four devices at the same time, although. With three devices it can output at 140W, 95W and 65W—enough for three MacBooks at the same time. And using all four charging points, still allows for two MacBooks at 140W. with the remaining two USB-C ports sharing 20W.
In our tests it scored 120%—a little lower than the Anker Prime’s 125% but nothing substantial in comparison. It can be recharged itself at 280W, which is a little faster than its Anker rival.
Who should buy the EcoFlow RAPID Pro 27K 300W Power Bank?
As powerful as the Anker Prime 26K Power Bank and boasting a built-in USB-C cable plus an extra port, the EcoFlow RAPID Pro is a real rival for the crown. If you can take the (minimal) extra weight and don’t need a USB-A port, it is highly if only for the retractable cable.

The Ugreen 48000mAh 300W Portable Power Bank is the missing link between a laptop power bank and a full-blown power station. It has a huge battery capacity but is still portable, although you wouldn’t want to carry it around in your backpack all day, and it’s too powerful to take on a commercial flight.
It has a handle so is carriable, but the bulk and weight mean it is one to move around inside or carry in a car. It would be the perfect power companion on a camping trip. It’s not super-heavy, but it is noticeably larger than the other laptop power banks tested here.
Keep it powered up in case of power outages and it should keep your laptop and phone going for days. In our tests we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro 1.8 times, so you can expect to get maybe as many as two charges for a MacBook Air. The Pro charged from 5% to 90% in an hour, which impressed us.
There are five ports (three USB-C and two USB-A) with a maximum simultaneous power output of 300W. As it has a 140W PD 3.1 USB-C port, it can be used to fast charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro. At the same time, you could charge another top-end MacBook Pro at 100W, and use one of the USB-A ports at 22.5W.
The smart display shows the remaining battery, total input and output power.
Who should buy the Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank (300W)?
Portable but certainly not pocketable, this is the border between power banks and power stations and would be a great travel gadget if you have a vehicle to carry it in. It is also a mini-prepper’s safeguard against power outages at home.

Retractable cables are very in right now—although nicely tucked away when not in use—for power banks and chargers. This 20K Ugreen Nexode Power Bank has one 2.1-foot retractable 100W USB-C cable nestled and ready for action right next to another 100W USB-C port and a 33W USB-A port.
At under 19oz it’s a little lighter than the cable-friendly Anker 25K 165W power bank, reviewed below, and is half an inch shorter, too. Although it matches the Anker on 165W maximum power output and 100W ports it does have a smaller battery capacity—although is therefore $20 cheaper. In our tests the 25K Anker recharged a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 92% while this 20K Ugreen power bank reached a respectable 78%.
In the battle for power and cable convenience, these two power banks must be chosen on capacity, portability and price.
Who should buy the Ugreen Nexode 20K 165W Power Bank?
This mid-range laptop power bank is compact and lightweight with a handy retractable cable, and will get your MacBook back up to about three-quarters power on a single recharge. Ugreen Ugreen sells another 20K model with a built-in USB-C charging cable. The $79 Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh 130W (above) is shorter at 5.1 x 2.1 x 1.9 inches (12.9 x 5.3 x 4.8cm) and $20 cheaper with the same 20K capacity but a lower max power output of 130W vs 165W. It weighs fractionally less than the 165W Nexode. Buy the 130W model if all you need is to charge a MacBook at 100W and an iPhone at 30W—this stubbier cousin may be all you need. It’s integrated 5.4-inch USB-C cable—useful for MacBooks and later iPhones—is nowhere near as long as the 165W model’s 2.1ft retractable cable but it can double up as a carry handle. Buy the 165W model if you regularly charge two laptops at the same time: one at 100W and the other at 65W. On both 20K models, the USB-A output can be handy for legacy devices.

The performance is impressive—we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to a respectable 92%, not far off the 100% from its slightly higher-capacity sibling Anker 27650mAh power bank—but what we love about this laptop battery pack is its handy 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable USB-C cable that means you don’t have to carry one with you when you take the power bank walkies. There’s even a second built-in USB-C cable that doubles up as a carrying loop.
Each USB-C port can output and provide input at 100W.
The cable wraps neatly into a groove at the top of the power bank. There’s spare USB-C and USB-A ports on one side, so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Note that if you want to charge more than one device, they must share the maximum output of 165W between them. However, 165W can only be supplied by two devices; with three and four devices, the maximum output is limited to 133W, although that is likely enough for most needs.
It’s available in either Space Black or Silver.
With its integrated cables this is one of the the most travel friendly laptop power bank we’ve tested.
A cheaper alternative is the 65W Baseus Free2Pull Power Bank that features one retractable USB-C cable, which is available in the U.S. at Amazon or in the U.K. via AliExpress.
Who should buy the Anker Power Bank (25K, 165W) with Cables?
If you frequently recharge multiple devices at the same time, maybe one integrated USB-C cable won’t be enough for you. This power bank boasts two cables, and performed well in our tests.

The INIU P62-E1 20000mAh (65W) Power Bank may have a dull name but it stands out a mile with its colorful looks—it’s available in six bold colors—and dare-to-be-different compact shape.
Not just fun to look at and easy to hold, it performed excellently in our tests, recharging a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 87% from a flat start, outperforming our 20K power bank, the Ugreen Nexode 20000mAh Power Bank, reviewed higher up, by nearly 10%. That Ugreen power bank features an integrated retractable USB-C cable and is more powerful with 100W outputs and a maximum 165W power—beating the 65W INIU.
The INIU P62-E1 might not have a retractable cable but it does boast a removable USB-C cable that creates a handy carrying loop.
While 65W is a little lacking—but not unusable—for the Pro MacBooks it’s ample for the MacBook Air. Who should buy the INIU Cougar 20K (65W) Power Bank?
Stand out from the crowd with this cute and compact laptop power bank that offers impressive performance for MacBooks that don’t require top-end power output to fast charge. That said, even MacBook Pro owners may desire something as lovely as the Cougar.

The Anker Prime 20K Power Bank is a laptop power bank that is lighter and smaller than the top-end Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank, but boasts the same number of USB ports.
Anker has a couple of 20K laptop power banks that are worth considering. The latest model is the 3-port Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (220W), which boasts two 140W PD 3.1 fast-charging USB-C ports and a 22.5W USB-A. When charging with all three ports at the same time, it offers two 100W outputs and a 20W. With two it can output two USB-C at 110W or one at 140W and the USB-A at 22.5W.
The older but slightly cheaper Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (200W) doesn’t feature the 140W PD 3.1 USB-C ports, instead packing two 100W USB-C ports and a generous 65W USB-A port. That doesn’t rule it out as a battery pack for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it can’t fast-charge Apple’s largest laptop. Its maximum output of 200W is a little below the 220W model.
Both feature a clear display but only the 220W model works with the Anker app. While the 27650mAh Anker Prime can be charged itself at 200W, the two Anker 20K Power Banks can be charged at a lower, but still reasonable, 100W using just one of its USB-C ports.
The 200W model is noticeably shorter than the 220W, measuring 4.9 x 2.1 x 2 inches (12.7 x 5.5 x 5cm) compared to the 220W’s 5.8 x 2 x 1.7 inches (4.4 x 5.0 x 14.7cm), although the 220W is a little lighter at 1.1lbs (510g) compared to the 200W’s 1.17lbs (529g).
The 200W model is cheaper at $139 compared to the 220W model’s $179 price tag, but both appear quite expensive when compared to some rival 20K power banks; see the Ugreen 20K Power Bank reviewed below. The 200W model fared impressively in our recharge test.
Who should buy the Anker Prime 20K Power Bank (220W or 200W)?
Although priced at a premium, these are great options for the smaller MacBooks unless you need as much power in the bank as you can carry. If you don’t need the 140W outputs, the 200W model will save you some cash, or consider the lower-output Ugreen Nexode 20K Power Bank below..
Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Thomas Bergbold Ugreen’s equivalent to the Anker Prime 20K Power Banks is the much cheaper $89 Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh, pictured above. The battery capacities of both are identical, but the Ugreen is noticeably lighter (1lb or 480g) even though its dimensions are closely aligned: 5.1 x 2.1 x 2.0 inches (13.1 x 5.4 x 5.1cm). Each has a smart display that tells you more than enough about what’s going on between the power bank and the devices being charged.
The Ugreen Nexode is a more portable solution, but we still prefer the Anker Prime model for both its impressive USB ports. The Anker has two 100W USB-C ports, while the Ugreen’s USB-C ports are rated at 100W and 30W. As the Ugreen power bank has a maximum power output of 130W, this doesn’t matter, but the Anker can pump out up to 220W simultaneously, making its powerful ports more useful. Power input is also better on the Anker (100W) vs the Ugreen (65W).
However, we’ve seen the Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh priced a lot more competitively than the Anker Prime 20K, and that weight difference may be important to you. Also, for the lone traveller one port for the MacBook and another for fast-charging an iPhone or iPad might be all that’s required. Read our full Ugreen Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh 130W review.

The Cuktech 15 Air laptop power bank we tested might not perform to the same degree as more expensive rivals but offers great value for money, and is hand-grip portable. Its color smart display has all the charging info you should require: battery level, input and output power, and estimated recharge time.
Its 15K (15000mAh) battery managed to charge our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to 54% power. That’s not as impressive as the 20K power banks reviewed here but it’s one of the cheapest MacBook battery packs that we trust.
You can use it as a multiple-charge iPhone power bank, too: it should charge an iPhone 17 Pro Max around 1.6 times. With the three USB ports all in action, you can charge the MacBook at 65W and share the remaining 33W between the other USB-C and USB-A ports.

The Cuktech 15 laptop power bank we tested might not perform to the same degree as more expensive rivals but offers great value for money.

A little cheaper than the higher-capacity Cuktech 20, reviewed below, this slim laptop power bank can also fast-charge even the 16-inch MacBook Pro with its 140W output. The 20 looks the better buy in terms of capacity and at a similar price, but the 15 Ultra has a special feature known as Beast Mode.
While the 25000mAh battery of the Cuktech 20 is certainly worth the small extra investment on this 15 Ultra in terms of capacity, this 20000mAh power bank impresses with its super-speedy 165W input, which means you can recharge itself faster than most using Beast Mode where you use both the USB-C ports to recharge the power bank up to 70% in around 20 minutes.

Outdoor adventurers and in-the-field professionals need devices that are stronger than softy office desk jockeys and occasional airport travelers, and the Sandberg Survivor boasts a tough !P66 shell that is impervious to water and dust. As such it is bigger than most power banks but it would survive outdoors much longer and has a big enough battery to keep a bunch of devices charged up before being introduced to a wall charger again.
Behind a protective rubber flap there are three USB ports: two old-school USB-A and one USB-C. We would have preferred more USB-C, which is used on most modern devices, and that singular USB-C port is also where you will charge the power bank itself. The USB-C port outputs at up to 65W and receives power at 60W. Each of the USB-A ports can output at 18W. Total simultaneous power output is 65W. Uniquely, there is also a 24W DC 5525 port if your devices can be powered using this connection.
As it charges at a maximum 65W, it’s better suited to the lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro and 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air, rather than the more powerful versions of the 14- and 16-inch Pro MacBooks that prefer a 100W or higher charger. That said, if your 16-inch Pro is on an outdoors adventure, the Survivor will still charge it, just a little slower than a 100W or 140W power bank.
Who should buy the Sandberg Survivor Powerbank?

Built for travel, this combo 4-in-1 wall charger and 10K battery pack can charge a laptop at 45W as a power bank and at 65W when plugged directly into a wall power socket. It comes with international plug adapters for U.K., E.U. and AU/NZ that slip onto the built-in U.S. foldable prongs—great for travel or just use in your own region. It even has a fold-out rubber handle that you can use to attach it to your backpack while hiking.
Its 10000mAh battery capacity is certainly not the highest of the laptop power banks we have reviewed here, but it did recharge a completely faded 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro back up to 45%, which should get you an extra few hours charge when on the move, depending on your laptop’s battery health.
Its two USB-C and one USB-A ports make it a capable AC wall charger, and a magnetic side pad works as a 15W Qi2 wireless charger for the MagSafe-ready iPhone 12 to 16 families. If charging by wall, the USB-C port output is 65W. When operating as a power bank, the USB-C port outputs 45W, unless also wireless charging when the maximum out put is 30W (15W wireless plus 15W USB-C).
A smart displays shows the power bank’s remaining battery charge, remaining time to full charge, real time output/input, and temperature.

The Cuktech 20 Power Bank 25000mAh 140W PD 3.1 power bank looks a lot like the Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, in a tall format with an informative smart display.
As with the Anker, there are three USB ports, with one at the required 140W for fast-charging a 16-inch MacBook Pro. The other two ports aren’t as powerful as the Anker’s though: 45W vs 140W, and 30W vs 65W.
An M2 MacBook Air should be fully charged with a little power left over for your iPhone, AirPods or Apple Watch.
Power input is also not as great, but at 110W it’s impressive enough compared to most. Maximum simultaneous power output is 210W—again not as high as the Anker but still respectable. The Cuktech’s display gives more data than the Anker, which is informative for wattage junkies but probably overkill for most of us, who just need to know how much battery life remains in the power bank. Anker’s dedicated app is perhaps more useful. Again, this is a nice to have and the Cuktech power bank does the important stuff of recharging the laptop at a price point that is noticeably lower than Anker’s.

The Cuktech CP253L is a budget rival to the Anker 165W Power Bank and Baseus Free2Pull Power Bank, and indeed any of the 20K laptop power banks reviewed here. It wins points for its built-in USB-C cable, although at 6 inches (15cm) the cable not as long or handy as the 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable cable on the Baseus.
It is also a less powerful: 45W vs 60W via USB-C, and charges itself slower, too. It recharged our test MacBook Pro to 75%, again a little off the Baseus performance but probably enough for most users in need of a power boost. At 45W it’s fine for the MacBook Air but a little underpowered for the Pro MacBooks, which will charge a little slower.
(We’re only interested in Apple’s MacBook here but if you also own a Xiaomi laptop, its USB-C connectors can charge at 55W and the USB-A supports 33W UFCS charging for some Chinese phones.)
Who should buy the Cuktech CP253L 20K Power Bank?
The lower power input and output plus shorter cable, along with a slightly heavier weight, are compromises you may well overlook when you see the price. This is a great-looking—in either black or a cool white—and solidly performing portable battery pack for your laptop. It’s also available in the U.K. unlike the Baseus.

This is another column-shaped laptop power bank with a high-capacity. The three top-mounted USB ports support PD 3.1 so it is particularly useful for owners of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which can be fast-charged using one of this power bank’s 140W ports. As total power output is also 140W, you can’t charge another device at the same time as fast-charging that top-end MacBook. If you want to simultaneously charge more devices, look for a power bank with a higher maximum power output. The similarly designed Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, can use all three of its ports up to 250W. The Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank, also reviewed previously, is a larger unit but can reach 300W total power output.
The Alogic Ark has a smart display screen that shows you how fast devices are charging, remaining battery capacity, and how long it will keep charging at the current speed.

### 19. `EN` [Rumor: Apple to Announce Multiple New Products in First Week of March](data/articles/dea5e252e512d3cf47ef8258624a61c3.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple on Monday invited selected journalists and content creators to a "special Apple Experience" on Wednesday, March 4 in New York, London, and Shanghai. And now, rumors are surfacing about Apple's broader plans for that week. Daring Fireball's John Gruber today guessed that Apple will announce new products on a day-by-day basis from Monday, March 2 through Wednesday, March 4:
What strikes me is that March 4 — the "experience" day — is a Wednesday. So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the "experience" will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos.
In response to Gruber's post, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said product announcements on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of that week is indeed "exactly" what he is expecting, based on what he has heard from his sources. Gurman does not expect a typical Apple Event live stream for the new products, with the announcements likely to occur in the form of press releases on the Apple Newsroom website instead. However, there could still be a short video prepared for each new product, and the media would get hands-on time with the new products. Apple has announced new products on a Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday basis multiple times in the past, including in March 2019 (new iPad mini and iPad Air, iMac, and AirPods models) and in October 2024 (new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models). Lower-Cost MacBook: A18 Pro chip, 12.9-inch display, and fun color options. iPhone 17e: A spec-bumped successor to the iPhone 16e, with rumored upgrades including an A19 chip, MagSafe, and Apple's C1X and N1 wireless chips. The device will apparently have a notch despite earlier rumors mentioning a Dynamic Island, and pricing will continue to start at $599 in the United States. iPad Air: M3 chip → M4 chip. iPad: A16 chip → A18 chip or A19 chip. MacBook Air: M4 chip → M5 chip. MacBook Pro: M4 Pro and M4 Max chips → M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, and PCIe 5.0 support for faster SSD speeds. Mac Studio: M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips → M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips. Studio Display: 27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting, up to 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and either an A19 chip or A19 Pro chip. Home Hub: An all-new smart home hub featuring the more personalized version of Siri, a 6-inch to 7-inch square display, an A18 chip for Apple Intelligence, FaceTime, and more. Place it on a table or mount it on a wall. Security Camera: Apple-designed, HomeKit-enabled security camera accessory to be sold alongside the new smart home hub.
In addition, rumors about new Apple TV and HomePod mini models have been circulating for more than a year, but there is still no sign of them. In the end, we might only get three of these new products in the first week of March, with the most likely possibilities being the lower-cost MacBook with an iPhone chip, the iPhone 17e, and perhaps either an updated iPad Air or entry-level iPad. tested those three colors plus pink for the MacBook with an iPhone chip. MacRumors will be attending the "Apple Experience," so stay tuned for our coverage.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
There is a long list of new features in the iOS 26.4 beta, many of which we highlighted yesterday, but we've since discovered several other smaller changes that Apple made in the software. Health App iOS 26.4 includes a new Average Bedtime metric for the sleep section of the Health app, providing a better idea of how bedtime can impact sleep quality. iOS 26, there was a section for the blood oxygen level, but the graph did not include a blood oxygen measurement. Camera In the Settings section of the Camera app, there is a new "Audio Zoom" option. The feature causes recorded audio to focus on the subject when the camera is zoomed while recording a video. It can be turned on or off, depending on the audio settings you prefer. CarPlay We found mentions of Apple TV support for CarPlay, indicating that Apple will eventually allow users to watch Apple TV content through their car's dashboard when the vehicle is not in motion. would add support for AirPlaying video content to a CarPlay display, and it appears that feature could come in the near future. Apple Music A song can be added to multiple playlists at the same time in the Apple Music app. In the add to playlist interface, there is a list button, and tapping it allows you to select multiple playlists at the same time. Hotspot Data Apple moved the location of hotspot data usage. Rather than having data usage metrics tucked away under Cellular, you'll see how much data you've used right in the Personal Hotspot section. Live Captions Chinese (Taiwan) is a new language option for Live Captions in the Accessibility section. Passcode Settings In the Face ID and Passcode section of the Settings app, when you enter a passcode to access your options, the text is now center aligned instead of left aligned. Shortcuts Apple added a Set Charge Limit action to the Shortcuts app. It sets a battery charge limit for the iPhone. For more on all of the new features in iOS 26.4, we have a dedicated iOS 26.4 features guide.

It's not clear yet what this is for, but Apple is having an invite-only event not at Apple Park, but instead a joint event in New York City, London, and Shanghai on March 4. It might be time for all those M5 MacBook Pro, iPad, and iPhone 17e rumors to come true. Apple invite to New York City
We're curious what this is about. Apple doesn't typically have big product releases in New York City, let alone also in London and Shanghai simultaneously. They want to show something off, that's for sure.
That said, it may not necessarily be a major announcement. There is no sign of any streaming activity for the event, which reduces the chances of it being a big hardware release. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

### 25. `EN` [Apple Sued by West Virginia for Allegedly Allowing CSAM Distribution Through iCloud](data/articles/cd126986aa5d9f6fc2fa09bbc42f98ba.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
West Virginia's Attorney General JB McCuskey today announced a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of knowingly allowing iCloud to be used to distribute and store child sexual abuse material (CSAM). McCuskey says that Apple has opted to "do nothing about it" for years. "Preserving the privacy of child predators is absolutely inexcusable. And more importantly, it violates West Virginia law. Since Apple has so far refused to police themselves and do the morally right thing, I am filing this lawsuit to demand Apple follow the law, report these images, and stop re-victimizing children by allowing these images to be stored and shared," Attorney General JB McCuskey said. According to the lawsuit [PDF], Apple has described itself as the "greatest platform for distributing child porn" internally, but it submits far fewer reports about CSAM than peers like Google and Meta. new child safety features, including a system that would detect known CSAM in images stored in iCloud Photos. After backlash from customers, digital rights groups, child safety advocates, and security researchers, Apple decided to abandon its plans for CSAM detection in ‌iCloud Photos‌. "Children can be protected without companies combing through personal data, and we will continue working with governments, child advocates, and other companies to help protect young people, preserve their right to privacy, and make the internet a safer place for children and for us all," Apple said when announcing that it would not implement the feature. later explained that creating a tool for scanning private ‌iCloud‌ data would "create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit." West Virginia's Attorney General says that Apple has shirked its responsibility to protect children under the guise of user privacy, and that Apple's decision not to deploy detection technology is a choice, not passive oversight. The lawsuit suggests that since Apple has end-to-end control over hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure, it is not able to claim to be an "unknowing, passive conduit of CSAM." The lawsuit is seeking punitive damages and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection measures. Tag: Apple Lawsuits

### 26. `EN` [Full internet by satellite could come via an Apple-designed iPhone or iPad case](data/articles/c949d0bcc68ce83b90e38ab4d79deda8.html)
**Source:** AppleInsider | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple's iPhone satellite capabilities can grow, but physics are remorseless. There's still a limit on how much satellite internet can do and how fast it can do it — unless Apple produces a case that it has been researching that doubles as a big antenna.
When Apple first launched Emergency SOS via Satellite with the iPhone 14 back in 2022, it was remarkable idea that since then has saved many lives. Apple has improved it since, and has plans for much more in future, but there is always an issue over establishing the satellite contact.
Users have to point their iPhone in the direction of a satellite orbiting the Earth, and then keep pointing at it as the satellite moves relative to the sender. One single low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite will cross from horizon to horizon in seven minutes, but line-of-site connection time is less than that in real life, and depends on buildings, trees, and terrain.
The iPhone software helps locate and track the satellite. The iPhone antenna still has a small surface area, and isn't that high-powered. Only so much data can reliably be sent before the satellite has moved away.
Now in a newly-revealed patent application originally filed in 2024, Apple has shown how it has been researching a way around this. "Electronic Device and Case with Satellite Communication Capabilities" details ways of using a case to act as an antenna for the iPhone. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

Apple's February 9, 2026 update to the CarPlay Developer Guide introduces a new CarPlay entitlement category for voice-driven conversational apps. The move creates an official path for third-party AI assistants to operate inside CarPlay rather than relying solely on Siri.
The change arrives as generative AI becomes more embedded across Apple platforms. CarPlay is next, but Apple is setting clear boundaries. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

### 39. `EN` [Kill iPhone spam with these 10 tips](data/articles/28c7c6817b01eac58aa5448d3944446c.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld The iPhone has become an all-in-one device for communication, entertainment, productivity, and more. Naturally, as we install more apps, the number of unwanted notifications keeps growing. Spam is no longer limited to occasional emails, texts, and calls; many apps now use push notifications to deliver ads, irrelevant recommendations, and other distracting alerts. Fortunately, iOS includes a comprehensive set of tools that help you reduce all sorts of spam types and focus on what actually matters.
1. Good ol’ blocking
Blocking remains one of the simplest, most straightforward ways to shut down a consistent source of noise. If the same phone number keeps texting or calling you, you can easily head to the info card in Messages or the Phone app’s call log and hit the Block button. All relevant third-party communication apps offer a blocking functionality as well.
Similarly, if an app you installed has been abusing the push notification system, you can tweak or revoke the permission. In the Notifications section of the Settings app, you can decide how an app gets to notify you, if at all. For example, you could turn off the Sounds toggle to receive silent alerts or uncheck the Lock Screen option to stop seeing banners when your iPhone is idle.
Before revoking an app’s notification permission, it’s wise to scan the settings in the app itself. Many apps let you opt out of certain notification categories. This enables you to still receive updates about the things you care about, and nothing else.
2. Limit mirroring
The Apple ecosystem lets iPhone users mirror calls to nearby iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Apple Watches. That’s not to mention that, beyond calls, macOS and watchOS support third-party app notification mirroring, and AirPods can interrupt your music playback to announce incoming alerts. These integrations are welcome, but can make using our everyday devices overwhelming. Fortunately, you can choose what alerts get mirrored to other devices without completely blocking them on iOS.
In the Settings app, under Notifications, you can turn off (for individual or all apps) the Announce Notifications feature that reads out alerts when your AirPods are connected. Likewise, you can go to each app’s notification settings and disable the Show on Mac toggle to stop mirroring alerts to macOS. The Watch app offers a comparable section to manage the notifications iOS pushes to watchOS, too.
To prevent all of your devices from ringing every time someone calls you, you can head to the Phone app’s settings and turn off Calls on Other Devices.
3. AI notification handling
If you’re using a newer iPhone, the on-device AI can analyze the contents of your alerts and highlight the ones it deems important. Apple Intelligence can also summarize long or multiple texts to make grasping their content easier. To set these features up, go to the Prioritize Notifications and Summarize Notifications pages in the Settings app’s Notifications section. Foundry 4. Scheduled summaries
Scheduled Summary is yet another alert management tool that helps you avoid unnecessary distractions. When enabled in the Notifications settings page, the feature bundles unimportant alerts throughout the day and delivers them together at a time of your choosing. iOS will still notify you about time-sensitive updates, like calls and urgent notifications. Foundry 5. Focus modes
Focus is Apple’s advanced do-not-disturb system, letting you pick which apps and contacts can notify you across your devices. You can create multiple Focus modes with varying rules to match your different activities. The Focus mode dedicated to work, for example, would let alerts from your boss and collaborative apps through. You could also set in-app filters that hide content accordingly, like concealing non-work inboxes in the Mail app. To set it up, head to Focus in the Settings app. Foundry 6. Messaging controls
While blocking is effective for alerts coming from the same source, users often get spammed by random numbers. Luckily, the Messages app accommodates that, letting you silence all texts (or non-time-sensitive ones) from unknown numbers. It could also place them in a separate inbox to keep your main view clutter-free. Go to Messages settings, enable the Filter Spam and Screen Unknown Senders toggles, then customize how you want the feature to behave.
7. Call management
In Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Phone, you can enable similar filters for incoming calls. Under Screen Unknown Callers, you can choose if unsaved numbers are silenced or asked for the reason of calling automatically using on-device AI. The latter option will display a transcript in real time, so you can pick up and take over the call if it turns out to be relevant. Otherwise, enabling the Unknown Callers toggle under Call Filtering will move missed calls and voicemails from unsaved numbers to a separate list. Foundry 8. Third-party solutions
While call management tools have become reliable on iOS, you could still opt for third-party apps for added functionality. TrueCaller, for example, can warn you about known spam/scam numbers and look up the likely name of the person ringing you.
9. Mail filters
Like Messages and Phone, Apple’s Mail app offers automatic lists to help keep your inbox clean. You can enable the Categories toggle under the 3-dot menu in your inbox to reveal five main lists—Primary, Transactions, Updates, Promotions, and All Mail. The Mail app will scan every incoming email and place it in the respective list, reserving the Primary list for essential messages. Foundry 10. Calendars

### 42. `EN` [Apple’s March event might bring several days of surprises](data/articles/f01a38641286d1e271f18b452d9325cb.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld We now know the date of Apple’s next event-type thing: March 4. But as ever, we won’t know the precise details or the products the company plans to announce until it chooses to make that information public.
Unusually, however, there’s a good chance that Apple will tell us about the new products first and host the event (or, to use the company’s preferred terminology, the “experience”) after. Because one respected pundit has put forward the theory that Apple will announce new iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks via press release on Monday to Wednesday of that week, before journalists and influencers are gathered for a hands-on session with the hardware.
John Gruber, writing on his Daring Fireball blog, ponders the large number of Apple releases that are expected in the next few months. We’re waiting for the iPhone 17e, he notes, new versions of the entry-level iPad (with an A18 or A19 chip) and iPad Air (with an M4), M5 Pro and Max MacBook Pro, M5 MacBook Air, and the rumored low-cost MacBook with an A18 chip. That’s a lot to fit into a single event. Perhaps too much.
“What strikes me is that March 4—the ‘experience’ day—is a Wednesday,” Gruber writes. “So my spitball guess is that they announce all these products via Newsroom press releases, day-by-day. Like, say, the iPhone 17e on Monday, new iPad(s) on Tuesday, and new MacBooks on Wednesday. And then the ‘experience’ will be a hands-on thing with in-person demos.”
Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who is generally keyed into Apple’s product launches, responded on X, saying Gruber’s guess “is exactly what I am expecting based on what I’ve heard.” Gurman has previously reported that Apple had a product launch slated for March 2.
There is a precedent for this sort of serial press release strategy. At the end of October 2024, Apple sent out announcements on consecutive days for the M4 iMac (October 28), M4 Mac mini (October 29), and M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro (October 30). The company even called this an “exciting week of announcements,” even though it only lasted for three days and wasn’t especially exciting, focusing only on the Mac section of its product portfolio. A week of announcements covering the iPhone, iPad, and Mac might do a better job of qualifying for that adjective.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld In a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple has three wearable devices in the works that could establish Apple as a leader in AI hardware. Apple is “ramping up work” on smart glasses, a pendant, and AirPods with IR cameras. The three devices will not be stand-alone products and will require an iPhone connection. Apple smart glasses
Smart glasses appear to be the priority for Apple—don’t expect Apple glasses to be an augmented reality version of its Vision Pro headset. These glasses will be more like the Meta AI glasses, with a high-resolution camera capturing photos and video. The UI will depend on speakers, microphones, and a separate camera dedicated to “give the device environmental context.” Users will be able to make phone calls, use Siri, play music, and shoot photos. Also, the user will be able to “take actions based on surroundings.”
Gurman reports that Apple hopes its camera technology will separate it from Meta’s glasses. Apple is working on advanced features, such as the ability for the glasses to recognize text and convert it digitally, and the ability to create context-aware reminders, such as a prompt to tell you to pick up an item you are looking at that’s on your shopping list while in a grocery store. For navigational directions, Siri could provide landmarks instead of generic instructions. Apple also thinks it can offer superior build quality that differentiates it from Meta. The glasses will use “high-end materials, including acrylic elements intended to give the glasses a premium feel.” Different styles could be offered as the product matures over time. Apple had looked into partnering with a glasses maker, but decided against it.
Gurman stated that Apple made “significant progress” in the development of the glasses, and it could be ready for production by the end of the year, with a public release in early 2027. Apple AI pendant

On February 16, Instant Digital posted that Apple won't be redesigning the iPad Pro significantly for a while. The report indicates that Apple will stick to routine chip updates without making major changes to the device's design.
The post states that the iPad Pro won't receive a major upgrade for years. The leaker attributes the pause to the high cost of OLED panels and limited sales growth following the last redesign.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple has a new AirTag for sale, but you’re probably not rushing out to buy one since you can still get the old ones for cheaper. But this deal may change your mind: Costco is throwing in a free AirTag when you buy a 4-pack for $100, essentially giving you five new AirTags for the price of 4, a savings of $45 on the price of buying five AirTags individually. (Note: You don’t need to be a member to take advantage of this deal.)
Apple’s 2nd-gen of AirTags have the same size as the previous model, and they look virtually the same. However, they have a louder speaker, which will make them easier to find even if your keys somehow ended up between couch cushions. Apple also upgraded the Bluetooth chip inside the tracker, expanding the range at which items can be located.
Also new is the U2 Ultra Wideband chip, which will make it possible to more precisely locate lost items, something that will definitely be handy. We’ve already tested the new AirTag 2 and gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, finding it to be a simple and efficient Bluetooth tracker that’s also super easy to set up and fairly inexpensive.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Berkshire Hathaway reduced its Apple stake by 4% in the fourth quarter of 2025, but Apple remains the conglomerate's largest equity holding by a wide margin. Berkshire Hathaway trims its Apple investment
A February 17 regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows Berkshire trimmed its Apple position during the quarter ended December 31, 2025. Apple was still valued at roughly $62 billion within Berkshire's portfolio at year's end.
The filing also shows Berkshire sold 77% of its Amazon stake in the same quarter, a far more substantial reduction than the modest adjustment to Apple. The latest stock cut by Berkshire isn't a harbinger of doom but rather a routine portfolio adjustment. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple may return to its marketing playbook, delivering multiple press releases of big products in just a few days, then highlight them all at the international March 4 "experiences." Apple's experience logo has many layers. The announcement of a special event on March 4 has led to wild speculation of what Apple could introduce at the time. However, with so many oddities surrounding it all, it may not be as straightforward as people think.
On Tuesday, Daring Fireball's John Gruber proposed that Apple's reference of it as an "experience" day is unusual. The choice of holding the event on a Wednesday is also unexpected, especially when you factor in Apple's preference for Tuesday product announcements.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple has made a major announcement this week that could affect the software you use, especially if it’s an older app, and you are using an M-series Mac. In a support document, Apple wrote that it will start to phase out Rosetta functionality with macOS 28. That means in two years, apps that were written for Intel-based Macs will no longer run on M-series Macs, except for “certain older, unmaintained games.”
When Apple began its switch from Intel chips to its own M-series chips in 2020, it changed the architecture of the underlying workings of the Mac. To help navigate the transition, Apple created Rosetta, which acts as a translator of Intel-based apps so they can run on M-series Macs. Rosetta will be included in macOS 27, which is expected to be released this fall. After that, Apple will limit the Rosetta implementation in macOS 28.
It’s been over five years since the first M1 Macs debuted. By the time macOS 28 is released in the fall of 2027, it’ll be seven years–Apple has a history of deprecating products after such time.
Developers have had plenty of time to update their software to either support M-series Macs exclusively or run universally on either chip. You can check an app’s compatibility by selecting the app’s icon and pressing Command+I on the keyboard. This will open a software info window, and in the General section, look at the listing for Kind. This will show one of the following:
Application (Apple silicon): The app was written for Apple chips
Application (Universal): The app was written for both Apple and Intel chips

**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
AI company Perplexity is stepping away from advertising over concerns that it will erode user trust, despite moves by rivals to introduce ads as an alternative money-making strategy. Perplexity was one of the first AI services to embrace ads in 2024, after it ran tests where sponsored answers appeared under the chatbot's answers. That approach however was phased out last year, and executives at the company now say they don't plan to revisit it, according to the Financial Times. "A user needs to believe this is the best possible answer, to keep using the product and be willing to pay for it," a Perplexity executive told the publication. earlier this month to show ads to ChatGPT users who have a free account or a low-cost Go subscription. OpenAI has said ads will not influence the answers that ChatGPT provides, nor will it provide advertisers with content from ChatGPT conversations. mocked OpenAI for its decision to show ads to users and has said it has no plans to do the same. The company argues that including ads in Claude would not be in line with its mission of creating a helpful assistant for work and deep thinking, and that users should not need to second-guess whether an AI is being helpful or "subtly steering the conversation towards something monetizable." Google features advertising in AI mode and in its AI Overviews summaries on traditional search results. However, Google has not introduced ads into its Gemini chatbot so far. Tag: Perplexity

### 111. `EN` [Can Eddy Cue break Apple’s slump?](data/articles/c441c8389c57530302682891a91c1df3.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Earlier this month, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple had scaled back its plans to launch a new Health+ service and was revisiting its entire health and fitness strategy.
While this could be seen as being another sign of trouble at Apple, as the company is currently mired in an ongoing narrative about its inability to ship AI features it promised nearly two years ago, I choose to see this as the opposite: a promising early sign that Apple’s executives are recognizing that its headlong charge into chasing services revenue might be coming at too high a cost.
The unlikely hero in all this? Apple’s services chief himself, Eddy Cue.
This isn’t good enough
At the end of last year, with the departure of former Apple COO Jeff Williams, Cue took over Apple’s health division. Even though Cue has been at Apple for a very long time, he was new to this group, and it seems to have made a difference. A new leader comes in with no ego invested in the path the group has been walking down, which makes it easier to see things fresh and not be afraid to make changes.
What Cue saw was a team that was busily preparing a new service, Health+, that offered AI-powered coaching features using data from Apple Health. His response seems to have been that, even for the guy whose job it is to grow and maintain Apple’s services business, the service being built was not compelling enough to launch.
But I think it goes deeper than that: The App Store has several apps that mine Apple Health data to generate AI-enhanced health information. What might have felt like an add-on feature a few years ago feels more like table stakes for Apple’s own Health app these days. And, according to Gurman, Cue has asked that a bunch of the features being built for Health+ just be rolled into the Health app.
It’s not Sherlocking
Is it wrong for Apple to look at other apps in the app store, like Athlytic, and realize that its basic, fundamental device features are lacking? This is the classic “Sherlocking” argument, but I don’t agree with it. There is a base level of functionality that Apple should be providing with every device it sells.

gull, paulla, logiciels-libres, projets, futur, assemblée-générale [FR Paris] Soirée de contribution au libre – Le jeudi 12 février 2026 de 19h30 à 22h00.
Le but des soirées de contribution au libre est de proposer un espace de travail partagé aux personnes actives dans le libre en Île-de-France le temps d’une soirée, une fois par mois (le deuxième jeudi du mois plus précisément).
Dit plus court: c’est un lieu avec de l’électricité et une connexion internet. En avant les claviers !
Les soirées de contribution au libre sont faites pour vous si:
vous travaillez sur un projet libre et vous recherchez une atmosphère à la fois conviviale et studieuse pour aller de l’avant et, qui sait, créer des connexions avec d’autres projets libres, vous êtes un collectif autour du libre et vous cherchez un lieu pour vous retrouver physiquement et avancer avec efficacité sur vos chantiers. Si vous n’avez pas envie de contribuer à un projet libre, les soirées de contribution au libre ne sont sans doute pas faites pour vous. Pas de panique, Parinux organise d’autres évènements:
si vous voulez discuter autour du libre: l’Apéro du Libre (APL) est là pour ça ; c’est un rendez-vous fixé tous les 15 du mois ; venez-nous retrouver autour d’un verre pour papoter et refaire le monde (libre), si vous avez un problème informatique: c’est la vocation de Premiers Samedi du Libre (PSL) où vous pourrez trouver des oreilles attentives et compétentes à l’écoute de toutes vos questions. Nous nous réservons le droit de refuser l’entrée aux soirées de contribution au libre à tout personne qui n’en respecterait pas l’esprit. Et, bien sûr, les règles de bienséance habituelles s’appliquent pour que chacune et chacun se sente à l’aise dans un cadre bienveillant.
Si les soirées de contribution vous intéressent, le mieux est de contacter d’abord le CA de Parinux ca@parinux.org. Vous devrez de toute façon nous écrire pour obtenir le code de la porte cochère…

Rencontre mensuelle autour des logiciels libres, en toute simplicité.
Ces matinées seront ce que nous en ferons ensemble, selon vos attentes:
Découverte des logiciels libres dont Linux et de leur intérêt. Utilisation sur place.
Installations, sur votre machine (pensez à sauvegarder vos données avant de venir avec) ou sur des PC fournis pour apprendre ensemble sans risque. Parfois, on vous propose un ordinateur auquel Linux a redonné une seconde vie, avec lequel vous pouvez repartir…
Préparation d’une clé USB pour tester Linux chez vous, l’installer ou alors pour utiliser des logiciels libres sans installation sous Windows.
Entraide, suivi de votre expérience avec les logiciels libres.
Nous pourrons aussi nous intéresser aux outils en ligne, aux smartphones, ou nous amuser à redonner vie à de vieux PC un peu obsolètes, à reconditionner des ordinateurs pour des associations ou personnes avec peu de ressources, etc.
Pour tout projet qui risque de prendre un peu de temps, il est préférable de nous contacter avant.
Les débutant·e·s sont les bienvenu·e·s! Les autres aussi, bien évidemment !

Quand un développeur demande à Claude ou ChatGPT d’écrire du code, l’IA pioche dans des milliers de bibliothèques libres sans que l’humain ne lise jamais leur documentation. Résultat: les mainteneurs de ces projets open-source, qui vivent de la visibilité générée par les visites et les interactions, voient leur audience s’effondrer. Une étude économique chiffre ce paradoxe: l’IA qui accélère le développement logiciel asphyxie l’écosystème qui le rend possible.

### 4. `FR` [L’ANSSI révise sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre](data/articles/8a512e5cc7bbd13459cb5362176c6f21.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) vient de publier une mise à jour substantielle de sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre. L’agence confirme que le logiciel libre et la transparence sont essentiels à la sécurité des systèmes d’information. Elle assume sa contribution au libre et la publication de logiciels sous licence libre.
Cette posture très favorable au logiciel libre et open source est une belle avancée et un signal fort. Jusque-là, la posture de l’ANSSI était beaucoup plus floue et sa contribution à des projets libres et open source pouvait même apparaitre en contradiction avec sa doctrine. J’avais l’impression que les collaborateurs de l’ANSSI qui le faisaient reprenaient à leur compte le dicton « Pour vivre heureux, vivons cachés ».
La politique de l’agence est désormais claire : l’ANSSI contribue, l’ANSSI publie, l’ANSSI a une stratégie pragmatique qui peut l’amener à s’engager ou non sur le long terme en fonction de la finalité de l’outil et des motivations de l’ANSSI.
Détail qui a son importance, l’ANSSI indique privilégier, sauf exception justifiée, la licence Apache v2.0 pour les projets qu’elle publie. Je suis ravi de voir ce service privilégier une licence mondialement connue à une licence franco-française ou européenne (elles ont le don de doucher nombre de velléités d’utilisation et de contribution). lien nᵒ 1 : L’ANSSI met à jour sa politique open source (9 février 2026)

L’association Drupal France &amp; Francophonie organise la 13ème édition du Drupalcamp les 9, 10 et 11 avril 2026 au campus Universitaire Grenoble Alpes de Grenoble (France, Isère 38). Drupal est « un système de gestion de contenu (CMS) libre et open-source publié sous la licence publique générale GNU et écrit en PHP ».
Après Rennes en 2024, puis un Barcamp à Perpignan en 2025, cette année 2026 nous emmène au pied des montagnes à Grenoble pour un format de 3 jours de rencontres, soit deux journées de conférences les jeudi et vendredi. La journée du samedi est réservée à la contribution.
Des moments d’ateliers et micro-formation sont également au programme, pour faire de cet évènement une réussite d’un point de vue communauté autour du projet Open Source Drupal.
Le Drupalcamp Grenoble c’est la rencontre de la communauté francophone autour du logiciel libre Drupal. Ouvert à toutes et tous, les rencontres, conférences et ateliers permettent d’adresser à un public toujours plus large des sujets et thématiques diversifiées.
Notre objectif principal est de rendre la création de sites plus simple et la gestion des contenus plus intuitive pour tous. Comme de fédérer les utilisateurs et professionnels qui utilisent Drupal au quotidien.
Du simple curieux au développeur expert, tous ceux qui s’intéressent à Drupal et aux logiciels libres pourront participer à cette manifestation rythmée par :
des conférences (jeudi 9 et vendredi 10 avril), données par des professionnels reconnus et des membres de la communauté Drupal au cours desquels des thématiques nouvelles seront explorées,
des sessions de découverte étayées par des démonstrations à l’intention d’un public plus néophyte,
une journée de formation gratuite (Drupal in a Day) dédiée à l’initiation pour que les curieux puissent se lancer dans la création de leur premier site (sur inscription)
des moments de réseautage et de convivialité avec, notamment, la très attendue soirée communautaire !

Utilisateur de Canoprof depuis 2019, cet outil est devenu un des piliers de ma pratique d’enseignement en Physique-Chimie (4ᵉ, 5ᵉ, 3ᵉ) et en Sciences (6ᵉ). Je l’utilise pour concevoir l’ensemble de mes supports aussi bien papier que numériques, ce qui me permet de maintenir une cohérence didactique forte sur l’ensemble du cursus collège.
La force de Canoprof réside dans la séparation claire entre le contenu et la forme. En tant qu’enseignant, cela me permet de me concentrer sur le fond pédagogique et la structuration de mes séquences, sans perdre de temps dans les contraintes techniques de mise en page. La richesse de mon fond documentaire, construit depuis plus de six ans, évolue ainsi sereinement au fil des réformes et de mes retours d’expérience.
Canoprof m’aide à formaliser une progression spiralaire efficace tout en générant des supports propres, structurés et accessibles. C’est un gain de productivité précieux qui me permet de consacrer plus d’énergie à l’accompagnement de mes élèves en classe. Guillaume Marmin, enseignant de physique-chimie au Collège Isabelle Autissier. Modèle utilisé : Canoprof Rencontres Scenari 2026 à l’ENSAM Aix-en-Provence 22-26 juin Les Rencontres Scenari 2026 auront lieu du lundi 22 juin (midi) au vendredi 26 juin (midi) sous le soleil provençal à l'ENSAM Aix-en-Provence.
Bloque ces dates dès maintenant, les détails seront précisés bientôt. Tu peux parler de Scenari aux conférences éclair de l’April ? Lors de la prochaine assemblée générale de l’April (samedi 28 mars 2026 à Paris) il y aura un temps de conférences éclairs (6 minutes) de 10h à 12h qui s’enchaîneront sur des sujets variés, en lien avec le Libre, entendu au sens large.
Si tu utilises Scenari, c’est une bonne opportunité pour parler de tes usages auprès des adhérent⋅e⋅s de l’April. Date limite pour proposer : 15 mars. Envoyer un courriel à confseclairs@april.org.
Il n’est pas nécessaire d’être adhérent⋅e à l’April pour pouvoir proposer une conférence éclair.
Plus de détails sur l’annonce de l’April. Nouvel habillage web pour Optim 24 Un nouvel habillage graphique pour Optim 24 fait son apparition sur la plateforme de téléchargement.
Il existe pour tous les supports web des 3 modalités d’Optim : site normal, site web simple, site web en tuiles. Mise-à-jour de Myscenari MyScenari vient de passer en version 6.4.5 (corrections de bugs dans le cœur et dans les modèles en version 25). Attention : cette version est la dernière à contenir Dokiel 5 et 6, Opale 5 et 24, Optim 3 À partir de la prochaine mise à jour de MyScenari, nous n’aurons plus que Dokiel 25, Opale 25, Optim 24. Pense à migrer tes modèles (et skins) pour ne pas être pris⋅e au dépourvu au dernier moment. Nouvelles versions d’outils Scenari Opale, le modèle phare pour créer vos contenus pédagogiques, passe en version 25.1.1. Au menu, entre autres : corrections dans les outils d’accessibilité, et amélioration de l’intégration de MindMap dans la publication Diapo. Et Opale est maintenant disponible en allemand ! Parcours, pour concevoir des conducteurs pédagogiques, passe en version 25.0.2 (corrections mineures sur le skin, l’éditeur et les vidéos HLS) et est disponible maintenant en français et Anglais. Dokiel, le modèle pour la documentation technique et logicielle, passe en version 25.0.6. Cette version apporte entre autres des corrections dans la publication de relecture et l’écran de contrôle, et l’amélioration des écrans décrits dans les publications Web (maintenant responsive). Optim monte en version dans ses deux saveurs Optim 24.0.7 et OptimPlus 24.0.3 avec des corrections mineures sur les publications Web et Diaporama, et dans le styage. LTI-suite, le serveur pour exploiter des ressources SCORM dans des LMS via LTI, passe en version 2.0.3. Lexico, votre modèle pour créer des lexiques, glossaires, thesaurus, vocabulaires, monte en version 25.0.1 pour apporter des corrections mineures dans la publication Web. SCENARIchain-desktop est à présent disponible en français, en anglais et en espagnol. Le savais-tu ?

But anxious independent users have been working on open-source patches for wiring up HDMI 2.1 into the AMDGPU driver outside of the realm of AMD and the HDMI Forum's blessings...

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Physiocab est un logiciel libre de gestion de cabinet de kinésithérapie, développé sous licence Affero GPL 3.0 et hébergé sur Codeberg. Le projet est porté par la société Allium SAS, dans le cadre de la plateforme communautaire Kalinka, dédiée aux kinésithérapeutes francophones.
Le projet vient de passer en beta publique (v0.9) et cherche des testeurs et contributeurs.
Pourquoi un logiciel libre pour les kinés ? Le secteur de la santé libérale souffre d'une offre logicielle dominée par des solutions propriétaires onéreuses, souvent opaques sur le traitement des données de santé. Physiocab propose une alternative : un code auditable, des données stockées localement sous la responsabilité du praticien. lien nᵒ 1 : La page de présentation du projet
lien nᵒ 2 : Le dépôt codeberg
lien nᵒ 3 : PeerJs (MIT) Fonctionnalités
La beta couvre déjà un large périmètre fonctionnel :
Planning hebdomadaire en drag &amp; drop, avec export PDF et gestion des semaines exceptionnelles, particulièrement orienté vers les kinés intervenant en multi-établissements.
Bilans Diagnostiques Kinésithérapiques (BDK) avec tests standardisés (TUG, Tinetti, Handgrip, EVA, évaluation du risque de chute…), export de PDF et historique comparatif.
Suivi des séances avec de multiples exercices structurés (équilibre, force, endurance, mobilisation), chronométrage automatique et calcul de progression.
Application tablette en PWA : fonctionne hors connexion grâce à un Service Worker, s'installe sans passer par un store, interface optimisée tactile.
Stack technique
Backend : Python 3.10+
L'application est multi-plateforme côté client (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). La communication entre l'appli de bureau et l'appli PWA se fait de manière directe via PeerJs. Cette méthode ne nécessite pas de préparation contraignante comme l'ouverture de ports.
Les données sont stockées localement, ce qui implique que le praticien reste maître de ses sauvegardes et de sa conformité RGPD.
Le logiciel a été testé par un kinésithérapeute en situation réelle plusieurs jours d'affilée.
Modèle économique
L'utilisation est gratuite, sans limite dans le temps et sans frais cachés, la licence Affero GPL 3.0 en étant la garantie. Un support payant sur devis est proposé pour les praticiens souhaitant une installation assistée, une formation à distance, des développements sur mesure ou un audit de sécurité.

Various forms of tools, colloquially known as "AI", have been
rapidly pervading all aspects of open-source development. Many
developers are embracing LLM tools for code creation and review. Some project maintainers complain about suffering from a deluge of slop-laden pull
requests, as well as fabricated bug and security
reports. Too many projects are reeling from scraperbot attacks that
effectively DDoS important infrastructure. But an AI bot flaming an
open-source maintainer was not on our bingo card for 2026; that seemed
a bit too far-fetched. However, it appears that is just what happened
recently after a project rejected a bot-driven pull request.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
En février, il y a la corvée commerciale de la Saint-Valentin et les réjouissances intellectuelles consécutives à la sortie d’une nouvelle version de la suite bureautique LibreOffice. C’est, bien évidemment, sur LibreOffice 26.2 que l’on va se pencher. Au menu, du très visible, comme les boites de dialogues, du très attendu comme la prise en compte du Markdown ou du moins visible comme le travail sur l’accessibilité.
Il va de soi que les notes de version sont plus exhaustives et qu’il ne s’agit ici que d’une sélection. lien nᵒ 1 : Notes de version Sommaire
L’accessibilité
Support du Markdown
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Writer
Calc
En vrac
Pour finir
Avant de commencer : toutes les captures d’écran ont été faites, volontairement, sur une interface très personnalisée.
L’accessibilité
L’accessibilité de la suite bureautique est un important chantier pour lequel une personne a été recrutée en 2023 (en). Cette version-ci a fait l’objet d’améliorations sensibles. Parallèlement, Sophie Gautier, coordinatrice de The Document Foundation1 (Foundation coordinator) est en train de monter un groupe de travail qui a pour objectif la publication d’un rapport de conformité en matière d’accessibilité pour répondre à la norme européenne EN 301 549 (en) d’accessiblité numérique. La langue de travail de ce groupe est l’anglais.
Concernant les améliorations de cette version :
la boite de dialogue « Vérifier les mises à jour », Aide &gt; Vérifier les mises à jour… est devenue accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
les fonctions d’accessibilité des aperçus des bordures, onglet « Bordures » des boites de dialogue, ont été revues afin qu’elles ne perturbent plus les dispositifs d’assistance ;
sur Linux : la boite de dialogue Outils&gt; Orthographe est annoncée correctement par le lecteur d’écran ;
quand on supprimait la sélection accessible, le curseur se déplaçait automatiquement au début du texte, ce comportement perturbant est supprimé ;
dans Writer, les fautes d’orthographe ne sont plus signalées par les dispositifs d’assistance si la vérification orthographique n’est pas activée ;
l’accessibilité au clavier de la boite de dialogue des extensions : Outils &gt; Extensions est accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
et enfin, il est possible de naviguer entre les onglets verticaux avec des raccourcis clavier.
Support du Markdown
Le Markdown est devenu le format de balisage léger standard « de fait ». Et c’est celui supporté par LinuxFR. Son support a été introduit dans cette version, c’est un des formats d’enregistrement qui s’est ajouté à la série des autres formats de la suite, pas un format d’export. Pour l’utiliser pour vos sites, passant pour LinuxFR, vous devrez :
soit ouvrir le fichier .md dans un éditeur de texte, n’importe lequel, même Mousepad fait l’affaire par exemple, et copier-coller ensuite le tout à partir de l’éditeur de texte là où vous le voulez ;
soit, si cela est possible, importer le fichier .md dans ce qui vous sert pour gérer le site comme le fait par exemple l’extension ODT2SPIP pour le système de gestion de contenu SPIP qui permet de créer une nouvelle page dans SPIP avec un fichier.ODT. ça marche avec LinuxFR ? Plutôt bien. Les styles de caractère Accentuation (ici en italiques) et Accentuation forte (ici gras) sont bien reconnu ainsi que Texte source pour « télétype », les indications in-texte encadrées de l’accent grave U+0060. Les styles de paragraphes :
Bloc de citation (paragraphes de citation précédés d’une ligne blanche et du signe « &gt; » dans la saisie de contenu sur LinuxFR) ;
Contenu de tableau ;
Corps de texte ;
Liste, par contre la numérotation des listes ordonnée ne semble pas bien fonctionner, il faut saisir les numéros à la main ;
Texte préformaté pour écrire des blocs de code ;
Titre 1, Titre 2, Titre 3 et Titre de tableau.
Les tableaux sont bien repris ainsi que les liens insérés via l’insertion d’hyperliens.
Ce qui ne semble pas fonctionner du tout : ce sont les notes, elles disparaissent corps et biens. C’est peut-être dû au passage dans l’éditeur de texte qui transforme un peu le document. Et, évidemment, il faut rajouter les images avec la syntaxe LinuxFR.
La version de Mardown de LibreOffice est CommonMark (en) et la bibliothèque utilisée est MD4C avec quelques extensions prises en charge par cette bibliothèque (cf ce rapport de bug (en) et ses réponses), pour en savoir plus, voir cette note (en) du blog de The Document Foundation.
Petite remarque, si vous utilisez un LibreOffice 25.8, vous avez peut-être pu constater qu’il était question d’enregistrement au format .md, cette information a été ajoutée trop précocement car la version 25.8 ne gère pas le Markdown.
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Les boites de dialogue, notamment de styles et de formats, ont beaucoup changé. Longtemps elles se sont affichées avec une présentation par onglets en haut et le contenu dessous.
Puis il y a une période de transition en 2025 qui a fait grincer une collection complète de dents où on avait, selon l’endroit où on était, soit des onglets soit une navigation par menu latéral. Cette dernière avait un gros défaut : par exemple pour la configuration des styles dans Writer il fallait descendre tout en bas pour accéder aux options qui étaient cachées. Et il n’y avait pas de barre de défilement pour aller plus vite.
LibreOffice 26.2 voit ces défauts corrigés : les boites de dialogue sont harmonisées dans toute la suite et leur menu latéral, toujours sans barre de défilement qui s’avère finalement inutile, montre clairement tous les types de paramètres auxquels on peut accéder. Et, comme on peut le voir, LibreOffice a intégré une meilleure prise en charge des systèmes d’écritures asiatiques et complexes en affichant deux colonnes, une pour les polices occidentales, ou pour les polices asiatiques ou complexes. Une personne a également été recrutée en 2023 (en) pour travailler sur le support des systèmes d’écriture de droite à gauche (RTL) et complexes (CTL). Si toutefois, vous préférez revenir à l’affichage avec les onglets, il suffit d’aller dans le menu Outils &gt; Options &gt; Apparenceau niveau de « Boites de dialogue » et cocher l’option Horizontal en haut. Il faut savoir que les onglets en haut ne s’affichent que sur une seule ligne et qu’il faudra donc naviguer avec les flèches quand il y a de nombreuses options. Writer
Il y a un certain nombre d’amélioration autour de la compatibilité avec le format DOCX : séparation de tableaux flottants en plusieurs tableaux, suppression de la numérotation des notes de bas de page à l’ouverture d’un fichier DOCX, etc.
On relèvera deux nouvelles options d’alignement des paragraphes : « Début » et « Fin ». Si vous utilisez l’alphabet latin, vous ne verrez aucune différence avec les deux options « Forcer à gauche/en haut » et « Forcer à droite/en bas ». Elles ont été développées pour réutiliser plus facilement les styles entre les divers systèmes d’écriture. Pour continuer sur la lancée du travail pour la prise en compte des systèmes d’écriture dont le fonctionnement est différent de celui de l’alphabet latin, il est possible de changer la direction du texte : de gauche à droite ou de droite à gauche en cours de travail. Cela peut se paramétrer dans les styles. Calc
Un gros travail sur les performances a été fait : vitesse de défilement, rapidité des classeurs avec de nombreuses formes et du rejet des modifications. On voit apparaître de nouvelles options de tri (Données &gt;Trier) qui dépendent de la « locale » (langue définie dans les Options de LibreOffice). On peut ainsi déterminer quel caractère est utilisé comme séparateur de décimal pour le tri naturel. On peut relever aussi une avancée ergonomique qui va plaire à toutes celles et ceux qui utilisent les matrices, on peut maintenant modifier les formules matricielles avec la combinaison de touches : F2 + ↑ Maj + Ctrl + Entrée, il n’est plus nécessaire de modifier la formule elle-même.
Et aussi : si vous utilisez (pourquoi diable ?) le format d’enregistrement XLSX, c’est le format EXCEL2010+ qui est le format par défaut, il change de nom pour devenir « Classeur Excel 2010-365 ».2
En vrac
Base est devenu complètement multi-utilisateur, TDF a, d’ailleurs, recruté une personne pour travailler sur l’application.
Concernant les diagrammes (ou chart) : dans le Volet latéral, quand le graphique est en mode modification et que l’on va, au niveau de « Couleurs », sur la palette, on a une prévisualisation en direct dans le diagramme ce qui permet de tester le choix de couleurs plus facilement.
Les polices embarquées dont la licence ne permettait pas l’édition étaient jusqu’à présent ignorées et remplacées à l’affichage, ni vu, ni connu par une fonte de substitution. Ce défaut a été corrigé.
L’export PDF gère les liens avec les documents externes : Fichier &gt; Exporter au format PDF &gt; Liens. Les dictionnaires hongrois, mongol et portugais du Portugal ont été mis à jour ainsi que les règles de césure de la langue hongroise.
JSON, pour JavaScript Object Notation, est un format standard utilisé pour représenter des données structurées. Il est utilisé notamment pour échanger les informations entre un navigateur et un serveur. C’est, par exemple, le format de sauvegarde des marques-pages de Firefox ou de certains fichiers d’archives de Mastodon. Les documents XML et JSON génériques avec des plages pouvant être liées sont maintenant automatiquement mappés à des feuilles dans Calc. Une plage pouvant être liée est une section d’un document contenant des enregistrements tabulaires. Lorsqu’un document contient plusieurs plages pouvant être liées, chaque plage est mappée à une seule feuille3.
Et si vous avez envie de vous amuser avec les fonctions expérimentales (à activer dansOutils &gt; Options &gt; LibreOffice &gt; Avancé), vous pouvez jouer avec la nouvelle de boite de dialogue « Gestion des macros ».
Pour finir
Cette dépêche a, bien, évidemment, été rédigée avec LibreOffice et, cette fois-ci dans un fichier enregistré en Markdown. Les seules balises que j’ai dû entrer à la main sont celles des images. Kate a l’air de modifier le fichier et, quand je réouvre le .md dans LibreOffice, il y a des styles qui ont sauté mais la mise en forme reste visuellement la même. Kate rajoute aussi des barres obliques devant les « &gt; », aux crochets [ ] et même à certains hyperliens (images). Il y a peut-être des éditeurs de texte plus adaptés ou des réglages à faire.
J’ai rédigé cette dépêche en même temps qu’un article sur LibreOffice 26.2 pour mon site. Si l’article n’est pas vraiment dupliqué, il n’est pas étonnant d’y trouver des morceaux ici. Que tout cela ne nous empêche d’adresser tous nos remerciements à celles et ceux qui font de LibreOffice une suite bureautique si agréable à utiliser et si performante.
Post-scriptum : si vous voulez savoir modifier les couleurs de l’interface comme sur les captures d’écran, ça peut s’envisager, demandez gentiment, avec un peu de chance.
The Document Foundation ou TDF est la fondation de droit allemand qui pilote le projet LibreOffice. Il y a deux formats OOXML différents et donc deux formats XLSX différents, la version 2007 et la version actuelle depuis 2010. S’il vous est vraiment nécessaire d’enregistrer au format XLSX, il faut utiliser la version de 2010. Notes de version.

### 37. `FR` [Rétablissement de l'« auto-attestation » pour les logiciels de caisse, l'aboutissement d'une année de mobilisation](data/articles/94205d2b52b4c2f91689aa6f73b5cf84.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Avec l’adoption du projet de loi de finances pour 2026, les éditeurs de logiciels de caisse ont retrouvé la faculté d’attester eux-mêmes de la conformité de leur solution, un an après que la certification par un organisme tiers avait été rendue obligatoire. Une mesure salutaire pour la pérennité des logiciels libres de caisse.
La loi de finances pour 2025 avait supprimé la possibilité, pour les éditeurs, d’attester eux-mêmes de la conformité des fonctionnalités d’encaissement de leur logiciel. Ils étaient dès lors tenus de passer par la certification, une procédure lourde et très mal adaptée à la réalité des marchés informatiques et à l’innovation, en particulier pour les logiciels libres. Une réforme actée sans réelle consultation, sans étude d’impact préalable et sans que l’administration fiscale ait exprimé de problème avec le dispositif.
L’April s’est mobilisée, tout au long de 2025, au côté des membres de l’écosystème, pour revenir sur cette réforme. lien nᵒ 1 : Texte provisoire de la loi de finances pour 2026 C’est dans le cadre du projet de loi de finances pour 2026, adopté le lundi 2 février, après une longue procédure et dans un contexte politique tendu, que l’« auto-attestation » a finalement été rétablie. Une mesure salutaire pour la pérennité des logiciels libres de caisse, inscrite à l'article 125 du projet de loi.
Article 125 :
Le code général des impôts est ainsi modifié :
1° Le 3° bis du I de l’article 286 est complété par les mots : « ou par une attestation individuelle de l’éditeur, conforme à un modèle fixé par l’administration » ;
Il ne s’agit pas ici de se prononcer sur la procédure retenue, ni sur le reste du contenu de cette loi de finances. Quoi qu’il en soit, le rétablissement de l’« auto-attestation » est une très bonne nouvelle, tant pour celles et ceux qui développent ou proposent des prestations autour de ces solutions, que pour les personnes qui souhaitent utiliser des logiciels libres pour leurs encaissements. Même s’il est regrettable que de nombreux acteurs économiques du libre aient dû se lancer dans une fastidieuse et coûteuse procédure de certification ou bien envisager des modifications profondes de leur modèle.
Un grand merci à l’ensemble des membres des écosystèmes des logiciels libres proposant des solutions d’encaissement. Sans leur engagement, ce résultat n’aurait sans doute pas été possible. L’April restera vigilante pour que l’« auto-attestation » ne soit pas à nouveau remise en cause sans étude d’impact sérieuse.
Court résumé de la longue procédure qui a conduit à ce résultat :
Pour qu’une disposition soit adoptée, elle doit d’abord être votée de manière « conforme » par les deux chambres parlementaires, c’est-à-dire strictement dans les mêmes termes. Puis, le texte global doit être adopté pour que la mesure devienne loi.
En première lecture du projet de loi de finances pour 2026, l’Assemblée comme le Sénat ont voté pour le rétablissement de l’« auto-attestation », indiquant une volonté claire du législateur en la matière. La première chambre avait toutefois rejeté le texte dans son ensemble, la disposition n’étant pas encore « conforme ». À la reprise des travaux, en janvier, l’Assemblée est repartie de la version du Sénat qui contenait la disposition concernant le rétablissement. Le texte sur lequel le gouvernement a engagé sa responsabilité – article 49.3 de la constitution – reprenait une version « conforme » de la disposition. Les motions de censure ayant été rejetées, le texte a été adopté. Dès lors, il ne restait plus qu’au projet de loi d’être définitivement adopté pour que le rétablissement de l’« auto-attestation » soit acté. Chose faite le lundi 2 février, suite au rejet des motions de censure sur l’ultime recours du gouvernement à l’article 49.3.

Simdjson has continued advancing since then with various optimizations over the years and today is out with simdjson 4.3 that brings yet more SIMD optimizations...

With the Linux 7.0 merge window beginning to calm down ahead of the 7.0-rc1 release due out on Sunday, one of the areas I was most excited about benchmarking on Linux 7.0 was looking for any performance gains with the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 "Panther Lake" given ongoing Intel Xe graphics driver improvements and other general kernel optimizations.

for general use. AccECN is a subtle change to how TCP works, but it has

**Source:** LWN.net | **Keyword:** `Development`
Justin Wheeler writes in Fedora
Magazine that Fedora is now available in Syria once again:
Last week, the Fedora Infrastructure Team lifted
the IP range block on IP addresses in Syria. This action restores
download access to Fedora Linux deliverables, such as ISOs. It also
restores access from Syria to Fedora Linux RPM repositories, the
Fedora Account System, and Fedora build systems. Users can now access
the various applications and services that make up the Fedora
Project. This change follows a recent update to the Fedora Export
Control Policy. Today, anyone connecting to the public Internet from
Syria should once again be able to access Fedora.
[...] Opening the firewall to Syria took seconds. However, months of
conversations and hidden work occurred behind the scenes to make this
happen.

**Source:** LWN.net | **Keyword:** `Development`
The Asahi Linux project, which is working to implement support for Linux on
Apple CPUs, has published a detailed 6.19
progress report. We've made incredible progress upstreaming patches over the past 12 months. Our patch set has shrunk from 1232 patches with 6.13.8, to 858 as of 6.18.8. Our total delta in terms of lines of code has also shrunk, from 95,000 lines to 83,000 lines for the same kernel versions. Hmm, a 15% reduction in lines of code for a 30% reduction in patches seems a bit wrong… Not all patches are created equal. Some of the upstreamed patches have been small fixes, others have been thousands of lines. All of them, however, pale in comparison to the GPU driver. The GPU driver is 21,000 lines by itself, discounting the downstream Rust abstractions we are still carrying. It is almost double the size of the DCP driver and thrice the size of the ISP/webcam driver, its two closest rivals. And upstreaming work has now begun.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing TP-Link over claims that the router-maker is misleading customers about its ties to China. In a lawsuit filed this week, Paxton claims TP-Link is "masking its Chinese connections," while serving as "an open window for Chinese-sponsored threat actors and Chinese intelligence agencies."
TP-Link was founded in China, but has attempted to distance itself from the country in recent years. In 2018, the company established a manufacturing facility in Vietnam, and then centralized its global headquarters in the US in 2024, forming TP-Link Systems.
Though TP-Link markets its routers and other products as " …

**Source:** Maddyness | **Keyword:** `Entrepreneuriat`
Faire all-in sur une seule carte peut-il s’avérer fatal ? Au casino, évidemment, mais également en matière d’innovation. A l’heure où tous les regards sont braqués sur l’intelligence artificielle, la France ne cesse d’accélérer dans son domaine, en tout cas en matière de financement, tandis que l’Allemagne opte pour une diffusion plus large de l’innovation dans son tissu industriel. C’est ce qui ressort de l’étude annuelle sur l’évolution des investissements dans la tech des deux côtés du Rhin en 2025 réalisée par le fonds franco-allemand Iris.
De prime abord, les écosystèmes tech français et allemand évoluent dans un contexte relativement similaire, marqué par la raréfaction des tours de table et une montée en puissance inexorable de l’IA. Dans le détail, les investissements dans les startups françaises se sont élevés à 7,2 milliards d’euros (+2 %), malgré un recul du nombre d’opérations (591 tours de table, -24 %). Dans le même temps, ce sont 7,5 milliards d’euros qui ont été investis dans la tech allemande, comme en 2024, avec néanmoins une baisse un peu plus limitée du nombre de tours de table (1 426 opérations, -3 %).
Focus sur l’IA en France, meilleure répartition sectorielle en Allemagne
En revanche, c’est sur la concentration du capital que la différence se fait. En France, les dix plus grosses opérations ont représenté l’an passé 37 % des montants investis, soit 2,6

Entre la tech et l’industrie, c’est : «Je t’aime, moi non plus !» Pour réconcilier ces deux univers, pourtant complémentaires et plus encore à l’ère de l’intelligence artificielle, Renan Devillières tente d’apporter une réponse avec OSS Ventures, un venture studio spécialisé dans la création de logiciels industriels B2B.
En ce début d’année, la structure, qui combine donc un startup studio et un fonds d’investissement, annonce un premier closing de 40 millions d’euros pour son nouveau véhicule d’investissement, avec une taille cible de 75 millions d’euros. Pour monter ce fonds, OSS Ventures a pu compter sur soutien de Decathlon Pulse, la branche du distributeur sportif lancée à l’été 2024 pour investir dans les startups du sport et du bien-être, et Teknor Apex. Les investisseurs historiques, dont le groupe Peugeot Frères et Tikehau Capital, ont également remis au pot à cette occasion.
Ce nouveau fonds sera exclusivement dédié au financement en follow-on des entreprises créées par la partie studio d’OSS Ventures. Et ce dans l’optique de leur donner l’impulsion nécessaire pour passer la vitesse supérieure dans leur industrialisation et leur déploiement international en Europe et aux États-Unis.

Recevoir une somme d’argent inattendue comme un bonus, une prime, un héritage, une cession de parts, ou avoir une trésorerie qui gonfle… Cela fait partie de ces “bons problèmes” que l’on rêve d’avoir. Et pourtant. Passé l’euphorie, une question s’impose vite : qu’en faire, concrètement ? Faut-il sécuriser ? Investir ? Attendre une période plus favorable ?

Rien qu’en 2025, ce sont 6 600 milliards d’euros qui ont été “mis de côté” dans l’Hexagone et ce alors que, comme le souligne Alexis Trigaut, “les rendements des placements sécurisés comme le Livret A sont faibles, avec un taux de 1,5 % depuis février 2026.
“À l’approche d’une période électorale ou en temps d’incertitude, on observe souvent une contraction de la prise de décision. On repousse ses investissements, on attend de voir.” Une posture attentiste qui n’est pas nécessairement problématique. Attendre peut être une stratégie - à condition que ce soit un choix réfléchi, et non un réflexe subi…
La pire erre

Minimal CLI coding agent by Mistral Mistral Vibe ░░ ░░ ░░ ██ ░░ ░░ ██ ██ ░░
██ ██ ██░░ ░░ ░░ Mistral's open-source CLI coding assistant. Mistral Vibe is a command-line coding assistant powered by Mistral's models. It provides a conversational interface to your codebase, allowing you to use natural language to explore, modify, and interact with your projects through a powerful set of tools. [!WARNING] Mistral Vibe works on Windows, but we officially support and target UNIX environments. One-line install ( ) Linux and macOS curl -LsSf https://mistral.ai/vibe/install.sh | bash Windows First, install uv powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex" Then, use uv command below. Using uv uv tool install mistral-vibe Using pip pip install mistral-vibe Table of Contents Features Built-in Agents Subagents and Task Delegation Interactive User Questions Terminal Requirements Quick Start Usage Interactive Mode Trust Folder System Programmatic Mode Slash Commands Built-in Slash Commands Custom Slash Commands via Skills Skills System Creating Skills Skill Discovery Managing Skills Configuration Configuration File Location API Key Configuration Custom System Prompts Custom Agent Configurations Tool Management MCP Server Configuration Session Management Update Settings Custom Vibe Home Directory Editors/IDEs Resources Data collection &amp; usage License Features Interactive Chat: A conversational AI agent that understands your requests and breaks down complex tasks. Powerful Toolset: A suite of tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution, right from the chat prompt. Read, write, and patch files (read_file, write_file, search_replace). Execute shell commands in a stateful terminal (bash). Recursively search code with grep (with ripgrep support). Manage a todo list to track the agent's work. Ask interactive questions to gather user input (ask_user_question). Delegate tasks to subagents for parallel work (task). Project-Aware Context: Vibe automatically scans your project's file structure and Git status to provide relevant context to the agent, improving its understanding of your codebase. Advanced CLI Experience: Built with modern libraries for a smooth and efficient workflow. Autocompletion for slash commands (/) and file paths (@). Persistent command history. Beautiful Themes. Highly Configurable: Customize models, providers, tool permissions, and UI preferences through a simple config.toml file. Safety First: Features tool execution approval. Multiple Built-in Agents: Choose from different agent profiles tailored for specific workflows. Built-in Agents Vibe comes with several built-in agent profiles, each designed for different use cases: default: Standard agent that requires approval for tool executions. Best for general use. plan: Read-only agent for exploration and planning. Auto-approves safe tools like grep and read_file. accept-edits: Auto-approves file edits only (write_file, search_replace). Useful for code refactoring. auto-approve: Auto-approves all tool executions. Use with caution. Use the --agent flag to select a different agent: vibe --agent plan Subagents and Task Delegation Vibe supports subagents for delegating tasks. Subagents run independently and can perform specialized work without user interaction, preventing the context from being overloaded. The task tool allows the agent to delegate work to subagents: &gt; Can you explore the codebase structure while I work on something else? I'll use the task tool to delegate this to the explore subagent. &gt; task(task="Analyze the project structure and architecture", agent="explore") Create custom subagents by adding agent_type = "subagent" to your agent configuration. Vibe comes with a built-in subagent called explore, a read-only subagent for codebase exploration used internally for delegation. Interactive User Questions The ask_user_question tool allows the agent to ask you clarifying questions during its work. This enables more interactive and collaborative workflows. &gt; Can you help me refactor this function? I need to understand your requirements better before proceeding. &gt; ask_user_question(questions=[{ "question": "What's the main goal of this refactoring?", "options": [ {"label": "Performance", "description": "Make it run faster"}, {"label": "Readability", "description": "Make it easier to understand"}, {"label": "Maintainability", "description": "Make it easier to modify"} ]
}]) The agent can ask multiple questions at once, displayed as tabs. Each question supports 2-4 options plus an automatic "Other" option for free text responses. Terminal Requirements Vibe's interactive interface requires a modern terminal emulator. terminal emulators include: WezTerm (cross-platform) Alacritty (cross-platform) Ghostty (Linux and macOS) Kitty (Linux and macOS) Most modern terminals should work, but older or minimal terminal emulators may have display issues. Quick Start Navigate to your project's root directory: cd /path/to/your/project Run Vibe: vibe If this is your first time running Vibe, it will: Create a default configuration file at ~/.vibe/config.toml Prompt you to enter your API key if it's not already configured Save your API key to ~/.vibe/.env for future use Alternatively, you can configure your API key separately using vibe --setup. Start interacting with the agent! &gt; Can you find all instances of the word "TODO" in the project? The user wants to find all instances of "TODO". The `grep` tool is perfect for this. I will use it to search the current directory. &gt; grep(pattern="TODO", path=".") ... (grep tool output) ... I found the following "TODO" in your project. Usage Interactive Mode Simply run vibe to enter the interactive chat loop. Multi-line Input: Press Ctrl+J or Shift+Enter for select terminals to insert a newline. File Paths: Reference files in your prompt using the @ symbol for smart autocompletion (e.g., &gt; Read the file @src/agent.py). Shell Commands: Prefix any command with ! to execute it directly in your shell, bypassing the agent (e.g., &gt; !ls -l). External Editor: Press Ctrl+G to edit your current input in an external editor. Tool Output Toggle: Press Ctrl+O to toggle the tool output view. Todo View Toggle: Press Ctrl+T to toggle the todo list view. Auto-Approve Toggle: Press Shift+Tab to toggle auto-approve mode on/off. You can start Vibe with a prompt using the following command: vibe "Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular." Note: The --auto-approve flag automatically approves all tool executions without prompting. In interactive mode, you can also toggle auto-approve on/off using Shift+Tab. Trust Folder System Vibe includes a trust folder system to ensure you only run the agent in directories you trust. When you first run Vibe in a new directory which contains a .vibe subfolder, it may ask you to confirm whether you trust the folder. Trusted folders are remembered for future sessions. You can manage trusted folders through its configuration file ~/.vibe/trusted_folders.toml. This safety feature helps prevent accidental execution in sensitive directories. Programmatic Mode You can run Vibe non-interactively by piping input or using the --prompt flag. This is useful for scripting. vibe --prompt "Refactor the main function in cli/main.py to be more modular." By default, it uses auto-approve mode. Programmatic Mode Options When using --prompt, you can specify additional options: --max-turns N: Limit the maximum number of assistant turns. The session will stop after N turns. --max-price DOLLARS: Set a maximum cost limit in dollars. The session will be interrupted if the cost exceeds this limit. --enabled-tools TOOL: Enable specific tools. In programmatic mode, this disables all other tools. Can be specified multiple times. Supports exact names, glob patterns (e.g., bash*), or regex with re: prefix (e.g., re:^serena_.*$). --output FORMAT: Set the output format. Options: text (default): Human-readable text output json: All messages as JSON at the end streaming: Newline-delimited JSON per message Example: vibe --prompt "Analyze the codebase" --max-turns 5 --max-price 1.0 --output json Slash Commands Use slash commands for meta-actions and configuration changes during a session. Built-in Slash Commands Vibe provides several built-in slash commands. Use slash commands by typing them in the input box: &gt; /help Custom Slash Commands via Skills You can define your own slash commands through the skills system. Skills are reusable components that extend Vibe's functionality. To create a custom slash command: Create a skill directory with a SKILL.md file Set user-invocable = true in the skill metadata Define the command logic in your skill Example skill metadata: ---
name: my-skill
description: My custom skill with slash commands
user-invocable: true
--- Custom slash commands appear in the autocompletion menu alongside built-in commands. Skills System Vibe's skills system allows you to extend functionality through reusable components. Skills can add new tools, slash commands, and specialized behaviors. Vibe follows the Agent Skills specification for skill format and structure. Creating Skills Skills are defined in directories with a SKILL.md file containing metadata in YAML frontmatter. For example, ~/.vibe/skills/code-review/SKILL.md: ---
name: code-review
description: Perform automated code reviews
license: MIT
compatibility: Python 3.12+
user-invocable: true
allowed-tools: - read_file - grep - ask_user_question
--- # Code Review Skill This skill helps analyze code quality and suggest improvements. Skill Discovery Vibe discovers skills from multiple locations: Custom paths: Configured in config.toml via skill_paths Standard Agent Skills path (project root, trusted folders only): .agents/skills/ — Agent Skills standard Local project skills (project root, trusted folders only): .vibe/skills/ in your project Global skills directory: ~/.vibe/skills/ skill_paths = ["/path/to/custom/skills"] Managing Skills Enable or disable skills using patterns in your configuration: # Enable specific skills
enabled_skills = ["code-review", "test-*"] # Disable specific skills
disabled_skills = ["experimental-*"] Skills support the same pattern matching as tools (exact names, glob patterns, and regex). Configuration Configuration File Location Vibe is configured via a config.toml file. It looks for this file first in ./.vibe/config.toml and then falls back to ~/.vibe/config.toml. API Key Configuration To use Vibe, you'll need a Mistral API key. You can obtain one by signing up at https://console.mistral.ai. You can configure your API key using vibe --setup, or through one of the methods below. Vibe supports multiple ways to configure your API keys: Interactive Setup ( for first-time users): When you run Vibe for the first time or if your API key is missing, Vibe will prompt you to enter it. The key will be securely saved to ~/.vibe/.env for future sessions. Environment Variables: Set your API key as an environment variable: export MISTRAL_API_KEY="your_mistral_api_key" .env File: Create a .env file in ~/.vibe/ and add your API keys: MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key Vibe automatically loads API keys from ~/.vibe/.env on startup. Environment variables take precedence over the .env file if both are set. Note: The .env file is specifically for API keys and other provider credentials. General Vibe configuration should be done in config.toml. Custom System Prompts You can create custom system prompts to replace the default one (prompts/cli.md). Create a markdown file in the ~/.vibe/prompts/ directory with your custom prompt content. To use a custom system prompt, set the system_prompt_id in your configuration to match the filename (without the .md extension): # Use a custom system prompt
system_prompt_id = "my_custom_prompt" This will load the prompt from ~/.vibe/prompts/my_custom_prompt.md. Custom Agent Configurations You can create custom agent configurations for specific use cases (e.g., red-teaming, specialized tasks) by adding agent-specific TOML files in the ~/.vibe/agents/ directory. To use a custom agent, run Vibe with the --agent flag: vibe --agent my_custom_agent Vibe will look for a file named my_custom_agent.toml in the agents directory and apply its configuration. Example custom agent configuration (~/.vibe/agents/redteam.toml): # Custom agent configuration for red-teaming
active_model = "devstral-2"
system_prompt_id = "redteam" # Disable some tools for this agent
disabled_tools = ["search_replace", "write_file"] # Override tool permissions for this agent
[tools.bash]
permission = "always" [tools.read_file]
permission = "always" Note: This implies that you have set up a redteam prompt named ~/.vibe/prompts/redteam.md. Tool Management Enable/Disable Tools with Patterns You can control which tools are active using enabled_tools and disabled_tools. These fields support exact names, glob patterns, and regular expressions. Examples: # Only enable tools that start with "serena_" (glob)
enabled_tools = ["serena_*"] # Regex (prefix with re:) — matches full tool name (case-insensitive)
enabled_tools = ["re:^serena_.*$"] # Disable a group with glob; everything else stays enabled
disabled_tools = ["mcp_*", "grep"] Notes: MCP tool names use underscores, e.g., serena_list not serena.list. Regex patterns are matched against the full tool name using fullmatch. MCP Server Configuration You can configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend Vibe's capabilities. Add MCP server configurations under the mcp_servers section: # Example MCP server configurations
[[mcp_servers]]
name = "my_http_server"
transport = "http"
url = "http://localhost:8000"
headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer my_token" }
api_key_env = "MY_API_KEY_ENV_VAR"
api_key_header = "Authorization"
api_key_format = "Bearer {token}" [[mcp_servers]]
name = "my_streamable_server"
transport = "streamable-http"
url = "http://localhost:8001"
headers = { "X-API-Key" = "my_api_key" } [[mcp_servers]]
name = "fetch_server"
transport = "stdio"
command = "uvx"
args = ["mcp-server-fetch"]
env = { "DEBUG" = "1", "LOG_LEVEL" = "info" } Supported transports: http: Standard HTTP transport streamable-http: HTTP transport with streaming support stdio: Standard input/output transport (for local processes) Key fields: name: A short alias for the server (used in tool names) transport: The transport type url: Base URL for HTTP transports headers: Additional HTTP headers api_key_env: Environment variable containing the API key command: Command to run for stdio transport args: Additional arguments for stdio transport startup_timeout_sec: Timeout in seconds for the server to start and initialize (default 10s) tool_timeout_sec: Timeout in seconds for tool execution (default 60s) env: Environment variables to set for the MCP server of transport type stdio MCP tools are named using the pattern {server_name}_{tool_name} and can be configured with permissions like built-in tools: # Configure permissions for specific MCP tools
[tools.fetch_server_get]
permission = "always" [tools.my_http_server_query]
permission = "ask" MCP server configurations support additional features: Environment variables: Set environment variables for MCP servers Custom timeouts: Configure startup and tool execution timeouts Example with environment variables and timeouts: [[mcp_servers]]

Additional Resources HyDE: Exploring Hypothetical Document Embeddings for AI Retrieval - A short blog post explaining this method clearly. Context and Content Enrichment Hypothetical Prompt Embeddings (HyPE) LangChain: Runnable Script Overview HyPE (Hypothetical Prompt Embeddings) is an enhancement to traditional RAG retrieval that precomputes hypothetical prompts at the indexing stage, but inseting the chunk in their place. This transforms retrieval into a question-question matching task. This avoids the need for runtime synthetic answer generation, reducing inference-time computational overhead while improving retrieval alignment. Implementation Precomputed Questions: Instead of embedding document chunks, HyPE generates multiple hypothetical queries per chunk at indexing time. Question-Question Matching: User queries are matched against stored hypothetical questions, leading to better retrieval alignment. No Runtime Overhead: Unlike HyDE, HyPE does not require LLM calls at query time, making retrieval faster and cheaper. Higher Precision &amp; Recall: Improves retrieval context precision by up to 42 percentage points and claim recall by up to 45 percentage points. Additional Resources Preprint: Hypothetical Prompt Embeddings (HyPE) - Research paper detailing the method, evaluation, and benchmarks. Contextual Chunk Headers : Overview Contextual chunk headers (CCH) is a method of creating document-level and section-level context, and prepending those chunk headers to the chunks prior to embedding them. Implementation Create a chunk header that includes context about the document and/or section of the document, and prepend that to each chunk in order to improve the retrieval accuracy. Additional Resources dsRAG: open-source retrieval engine that implements this technique (and a few other advanced RAG techniques) Relevant Segment Extraction : Overview Relevant segment extraction (RSE) is a method of dynamically constructing multi-chunk segments of text that are relevant to a given query.

Open Source Continuous Inference Benchmarking Qwen3.5, DeepSeek, GPTOSS - GB200 NVL72 vs MI355X vs B200 vs GB300 NVL72 vs H100 &amp; soon TPUv6e/v7/Trainium2/3 InferenceX, Open Source Inference Frequent Benchmarking InferenceX (formerly InferenceMAX) runs our suite of benchmarks every night, continually re-benchmarking the world’s most popular open-source inference frameworks used by major token factories and models to track real performance in real time. As these software stacks improve, InferenceX captures that progress in near real-time, providing a live indicator of inference performance progress. A live dashboard is available for free publicly at https://inferencex.com/. [!IMPORTANT] Only SemiAnalysisAI/InferenceX repo contains the Official InferenceX result, all other forks &amp; repos are Unofficial. The benchmark setup &amp; quality of machines/clouds in unofficial repos may be differ leading to subpar benchmarking. Unofficial must be explicitly labelled as Unofficial. Forks may not remove this disclaimer Full Article Write Up for InferenceXv2 Full Article Write Up for InferenceXv1 Why? InferenceX, an open-source, under Apache2 license, automated benchmark designed to move at the same rapid speed as the software ecosystem itself, is built to address this challenge. LLM Inference performance is driven by two pillars, hardware and software. While hardware innovation drives step jumps in performance every year through the release of new GPUs/XPUs and new systems, software evolves every single day, delivering continuous performance gains on top of these step jumps. Speed is the Moat AI software like SGLang, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, CUDA, ROCm and achieve this continuous improvement in performance through kernel-level optimizations, distributed inference strategies, and scheduling innovations that increase the pareto frontier of performance in incremental releases that can be just days apart. This pace of software advancement creates a challenge: benchmarks conducted at a fixed point in time quickly go stale and do not represent the performance that can be achieved with the latest software packages. Acknowledgements &amp; Supporters Thank you to Lisa Su and Anush Elangovan for providing the MI355X and CDNA3 GPUs for this free and open-source project. We want to recognize the many AMD contributors for their responsiveness and for debugging, optimizing, and validating performance across AMD GPUs. We’re also grateful to Jensen Huang and Ian Buck for supporting this open source with access to a GB200 NVL72 rack (through OCI) and B200 GPUs. Thank you to the many NVIDIA contributors from the NVIDIA inference team, NVIDIA Dynamo team. We also want to recognize the SGLang, vLLM, and TensorRT-LLM maintainers for building a world-class software stack and open sourcing it to the entire world. Finally, we’re grateful to Crusoe, CoreWeave, Nebius, TensorWave, Oracle and TogetherAI for supporting open-source innovation through compute resources, enabling this. "As we build systems at unprecedented scale, it's critical for the ML community to have open, transparent benchmarks that reflect how inference really performs across hardware and software. InferenceX's head-to-head benchmarks cut through the noise and provide a living picture of token throughput, performance per dollar, and tokens per Megawatt. This kind of open source effort strengthens the entire ecosystem and helps everyone, from researchers to operators of frontier datacenters, make smarter decisions." - Peter Hoeschele, VP of Infrastructure and Industrial Compute, OpenAI Stargate "The gap between theoretical peak and real-world inference throughput is often determined by systems software: inference engine, distributed strategies, and low-level kernels. InferenceX is valuable because it benchmarks the latest software showing how optimizations actually play out across various hardware. Open, reproducible results like these help the whole community move faster.” - Tri Dao, Chief Scientist of Together AI &amp; Inventor of Flash Attention “The industry needs many public, reproducible benchmarks of inference performance. We’re excited to collaborate with InferenceX from the vLLM team. More diverse workloads and scenarios that everyone can trust and reference will help the ecosystem move forward. Fair, transparent measurements drive progress across every layer of the stack, from model architectures to inference engines to hardware.” – Simon Mo, vLLM Project Co-Lead

What you can expect: Hackable with a modular design that allows easy integration, customization and quick research prototypes. Minimal ceremony: YAML‑driven recipes; override any field via CLI. High performance and flexibility with custom kernels and DTensor support. Seamless integration with Hugging Face for day-0 model support, ease of use, and wide range of supported models. Efficient resource management using k8s and Slurm, enabling scalable and flexible deployment across configurations. Comprehensive documentation that is both detailed and user-friendly, with practical examples. Note: NeMo AutoModel is under active development. New features, improvements, and documentation updates are released regularly. We are working toward a stable release, so expect the interface to solidify over time. Your feedback and contributions are welcome, and we encourage you to follow along as new updates roll out. Why PyTorch Distributed and SPMD One program, any scale: The same training script runs on 1 GPU or 1000+ by changing the mesh. PyTorch Distributed native: Partition model/optimizer states with DeviceMesh + placements (Shard, Replicate). SPMD first: Parallelism is configuration. No model rewrites when scaling up or changing strategy. Decoupled concerns: Model code stays pure PyTorch; parallel strategy lives in config. Composability: Mix tensor, sequence, and data parallel by editing placements. Portability: Fewer bespoke abstractions; easier to reason about failure modes and restarts.

Getting Started We recommend using uv for reproducible Python environments. # Setup environment before running any commands
uv venv
uv sync --frozen --all-extras uv pip install nemo_automodel # latest release
# or: uv pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel.git
uv run python -c "import nemo_automodel; print('AutoModel ready')" Run a Recipe To run a NeMo AutoModel recipe, you need a recipe script (e.g., LLM, VLM) and a YAML config file (e.g., LLM, VLM): # Command invocation format:
uv run --config # LLM example: multi-GPU with FSDP2
uv run torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py --config examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_hellaswag.yaml # VLM example: single GPU fine-tuning (Gemma-3-VL) with LoRA
uv run examples/vlm_finetune/finetune.py --config examples/vlm_finetune/gemma3/gemma3_vl_4b_cord_v2_peft.yaml LLM Pre-training LLM Pre-training Single Node We provide an example SFT experiment using the Fineweb dataset with a nano-GPT model, ideal for quick experimentation on a single node. uv run torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 \ examples/llm_pretrain/pretrain.py \ -c examples/llm_pretrain/nanogpt_pretrain.yaml LLM Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) We provide an example SFT experiment using the SQuAD dataset. LLM SFT Single Node The default SFT configuration is set to run on a single GPU. To start the experiment: uv run python3 \ examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py \ -c examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml This fine-tunes the Llama3.2-1B model on the SQuAD dataset using a 1 GPU. To use multiple GPUs on a single node in an interactive environment, you can run the same command using torchrun and adjust the --proc-per-node argument to the number of needed GPUs. uv run torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 \ examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py \ -c examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml Alternatively, you can use the automodel CLI application to launch the same job, for example: uv run automodel finetune llm \ --nproc-per-node=8 \ -c examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml LLM SFT Multi Node You can use the automodel CLI application to launch a job on a SLURM cluster, for example: # First you need to specify the SLURM section in your YAML config, for example: cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml
slurm: job_name: llm-finetune # set to the job name you want to use nodes: 2 # set to the needed number of nodes ntasks_per_node: 8 time: 00:30:00 account: your_account partition: gpu container_image: nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:25.07 gpus_per_node: 8 # This adds "#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=8" to the script # Optional: Add extra mount points if needed extra_mounts: - /lustre:/lustre # Optional: Specify custom HF_HOME location (will auto-create if not specified) hf_home: /path/to/your/HF_HOME # Optional : Specify custom env vars # env_vars: # ENV_VAR: value # Optional: Specify custom job directory (defaults to cwd/slurm_jobs) # job_dir: /path/to/slurm/jobs
EOF # using the updated YAML you can launch the job.
uv run automodel finetune llm \ -c examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_squad.yaml LLM Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) We provide a PEFT example using the HellaSwag dataset. LLM PEFT Single Node # Memory‑efficient SFT with LoRA
uv run examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py \
--config examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_hellaswag_peft.yaml # You can always overwrite parameters by appending them to the command, for example,
# if you want to increase the micro-batch size you can do
uv run examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py \ --config examples/llm_finetune/llama3_2/llama3_2_1b_hellaswag_peft.yaml \ --step_scheduler.local_batch_size 16 # The above command will modify the `local_batch_size` variable to have value 16 in the
# section `step_scheduler` of the yaml file. [!NOTE] Launching a multi-node PEFT example requires only adding a slurm section to your config, similarly to the SFT case. VLM Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) We provide a VLM SFT example using Qwen2.5‑VL for end‑to‑end fine‑tuning on image‑text data. VLM SFT Single Node # Qwen2.5‑VL on a 8 GPUs

Organize your LLM &amp; Embedding models: Support both local LLMs &amp; popular API providers (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, Groq). Hybrid RAG pipeline: Sane default RAG pipeline with hybrid (full-text &amp; vector) retriever and re-ranking to ensure best retrieval quality. Multi-modal QA support: Perform Question Answering on multiple documents with figures and tables support. Support multi-modal document parsing (selectable options on UI). Advanced citations with document preview: By default the system will provide detailed citations to ensure the correctness of LLM answers. View your citations (incl. relevant score) directly in the in-browser PDF viewer with highlights. Warning when retrieval pipeline return low relevant articles. Support complex reasoning methods: Use question decomposition to answer your complex/multi-hop question. Support agent-based reasoning with ReAct, ReWOO and other agents. Configurable settings UI: You can adjust most important aspects of retrieval &amp; generation process on the UI (incl. prompts). Extensible: Being built on Gradio, you are free to customize or add any UI elements as you like. Also, we aim to support multiple strategies for document indexing &amp; retrieval. GraphRAG indexing pipeline is provided as an example. Installation If you are not a developer and just want to use the app, please check out our easy-to-follow User Guide. Download the .zip file from the latest release to get all the newest features and bug fixes. System requirements Python &gt;= 3.10 Docker: optional, if you install with Docker Unstructured if you want to process files other than .pdf, .html, .mhtml, and .xlsx documents. Installation steps differ depending on your operating system. Please visit the link and follow the specific instructions provided there. With Docker ( ) We support both lite &amp; full version of Docker images. With full version, the extra packages of unstructured will be installed, which can support additional file types (.doc, .docx, ...) but the cost is larger docker image size. For most users, the lite image should work well in most cases. To use the full version. docker run \
-e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \
-e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \
-v ./ktem_app_data:/app/ktem_app_data \
-p 7860:7860 -it --rm \
ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-full To use the full version with bundled Ollama for local / private RAG. # change image name to
docker run &lt;...&gt; ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-ollama To use the lite version. # change image name to docker run &lt;...&gt; ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite We currently support and test two platforms: linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 (for newer Mac). You can specify the platform by passing --platform in the docker run command. For example: # To run docker with platform linux/arm64
docker run \
-e GRADIO_SERVER_NAME=0.0.0.0 \
-e GRADIO_SERVER_PORT=7860 \
-v ./ktem_app_data:/app/ktem_app_data \
-p 7860:7860 -it --rm \
--platform linux/arm64 \
ghcr.io/cinnamon/kotaemon:main-lite Once everything is set up correctly, you can go to http://localhost:7860/ to access the WebUI. We use GHCR to store docker images, all images can be found here. Without Docker Clone and install required packages on a fresh python environment. # optional (setup env)
conda create -n kotaemon python=3.10
conda activate kotaemon # clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon
cd kotaemon pip install -e "libs/kotaemon[all]"
pip install -e "libs/ktem" Create a .env file in the root of this project. Use .env.example as a template The .env file is there to serve use cases where users want to pre-config the models before starting up the app (e.g. deploy the app on HF hub). The file will only be used to populate the db once upon the first run, it will no longer be used in consequent runs. (Optional) To enable in-browser PDF_JS viewer, download PDF_JS_DIST then extract it to libs/ktem/ktem/assets/prebuilt Start the web server: python app.py The app will be automatically launched in your browser. Default username and password are both admin. You can set up additional users directly through the UI. Check the Resources tab and LLMs and Embeddings and ensure that your api_key value is set correctly from your .env file. If it is not set, you can set it there. Setup GraphRAG [!NOTE] Official MS GraphRAG indexing only works with OpenAI or Ollama API. We recommend most users to use NanoGraphRAG implementation for straightforward integration with Kotaemon. Setup Nano GRAPHRAG Install nano-GraphRAG: pip install nano-graphrag nano-graphrag install might introduce version conflicts, see this issue To quickly fix: pip uninstall hnswlib chroma-hnswlib &amp;&amp; pip install chroma-hnswlib Launch Kotaemon with USE_NANO_GRAPHRAG=true environment variable. Set your default LLM &amp; Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from NanoGraphRAG. Setup LIGHTRAG Install LightRAG: pip install git+https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG.git LightRAG install might introduce version conflicts, see this issue To quickly fix: pip uninstall hnswlib chroma-hnswlib &amp;&amp; pip install chroma-hnswlib Launch Kotaemon with USE_LIGHTRAG=true environment variable. Set your default LLM &amp; Embedding models in Resources setting and it will be recognized automatically from LightRAG. Setup MS GRAPHRAG Non-Docker Installation: If you are not using Docker, install GraphRAG with the following command: pip install "graphrag&lt;=0.3.6" future Setting Up API KEY: To use the GraphRAG retriever feature, ensure you set the GRAPHRAG_API_KEY environment variable. You can do this directly in your environment or by adding it to a .env file. Using Local Models and Custom Settings: If you want to use GraphRAG with local models (like Ollama) or customize the default LLM and other configurations, set the USE_CUSTOMIZED_GRAPHRAG_SETTING environment variable to true. Then, adjust your settings in the settings.yaml.example file. Setup Local Models (for local/private RAG) See Local model setup. Setup multimodal document parsing (OCR, table parsing, figure extraction) These options are available: Azure Document Intelligence (API) Adobe PDF Extract (API) Docling (local, open-source) To use Docling, first install required dependencies: pip install docling Select corresponding loaders in Settings -&gt; Retrieval Settings -&gt; File loader Customize your application By default, all application data is stored in the ./ktem_app_data folder. You can back up or copy this folder to transfer your installation to a new machine. For advanced users or specific use cases, you can customize these files: flowsettings.py .env flowsettings.py This file contains the configuration of your application. You can use the example here as the starting point. Notable settings # setup your preferred document store (with full-text search capabilities)
KH_DOCSTORE=(Elasticsearch | LanceDB | SimpleFileDocumentStore) # setup your preferred vectorstore (for vector-based search)
KH_VECTORSTORE=(ChromaDB | LanceDB | InMemory | Milvus | Qdrant) # Enable / disable multimodal QA
KH_REASONINGS_USE_MULTIMODAL=True # Setup your new reasoning pipeline or modify existing one.
KH_REASONINGS = [ "ktem.reasoning.simple.FullQAPipeline", "ktem.reasoning.simple.FullDecomposeQAPipeline", "ktem.reasoning.react.ReactAgentPipeline", "ktem.reasoning.rewoo.RewooAgentPipeline",
] .env This file provides another way to configure your models and credentials. Configure model via the .env file Alternatively, you can configure the models via the .env file with the information needed to connect to the LLMs. This file is located in the folder of the application. If you don't see it, you can create one. Currently, the following providers are supported: OpenAI In the .env file, set the OPENAI_API_KEY variable with your OpenAI API key in order to enable access to OpenAI's models. There are other variables that can be modified, please feel free to edit them to fit your case. Otherwise, the default parameter should work for most people. OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002 Azure OpenAI For OpenAI models via Azure platform, you need to provide your Azure endpoint and API key.

ollama pull nomic-embed-text Set the model names on web UI and make it as default: Using GGUF with llama-cpp-python You can search and download a LLM to be ran locally from the Hugging Face Hub. Currently, these model formats are supported: GGUF You should choose a model whose size is less than your device's memory and should leave about 2 GB. For example, if you have 16 GB of RAM in total, of which 12 GB is available, then you should choose a model that takes up at most 10 GB of RAM. Bigger models tend to give better generation but also take more processing time. Here are some recommendations and their size in memory: Qwen1.5-1.8B-Chat-GGUF: around 2 GB Add a new LlamaCpp model with the provided model name on the web UI. Adding your own RAG pipeline Custom Reasoning Pipeline Check the default pipeline implementation in here. You can make quick adjustment to how the default QA pipeline work.

Open Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform Introduction OpenCTI is an open source platform allowing organizations to manage their cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. It has been created in order to structure, store, organize and visualize technical and non-technical information about cyber threats. The structuration of the data is performed using a knowledge schema based on the STIX2 standards. It has been designed as a modern web application including a GraphQL API and an UX oriented frontend. Also, OpenCTI can be integrated with other tools and applications such as MISP, TheHive, MITRE ATT&amp;CK, etc. Objective The goal is to create a comprehensive tool allowing users to capitalize technical (such as TTPs and observables) and non-technical information (such as suggested attribution, victimology etc.) while linking each piece of information to its primary source (a report, a MISP event, etc.), with features such as links between each information, first and last seen dates, levels of confidence, etc. The tool is able to use the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework (through a dedicated connector) to help structure the data. The user can also choose to implement their own datasets. Once data has been capitalized and processed by the analysts within OpenCTI, new relations may be inferred from existing ones to facilitate the understanding and the representation of this information. This allows the user to extract and leverage meaningful knowledge from the raw data. OpenCTI not only allows imports but also exports of data under different formats (CSV, STIX2 bundles, etc.). Connectors are currently developed to accelerate interactions between the tool and other platforms. Editions of the platform OpenCTI platform has 2 different editions: Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE). The purpose of the Enterprise Edition is to provide additional and powerful features which require specific investments in research and development. You can enable the Enterprise Edition directly in the settings of the platform. OpenCTI Community Edition, licensed under the Apache 2, Version 2.0 license. OpenCTI Enterprise Edition, licensed under the Enterprise Edition license. To understand what OpenCTI Enterprise Edition brings in terms of features, just check the Enterprise Editions page on the Filigran website. You can also try this edition by enabling it in the settings of the platform. Documentation and demonstration If you want to know more on OpenCTI, you can read the documentation on the tool. If you wish to discover how the OpenCTI platform is working, a demonstration instance is available and open to everyone. This instance is reset every night and is based on reference data maintained by the OpenCTI developers. Releases download The releases are available on the Github releases page. You can also access the rolling release package generated from the master branch of the repository. Installation All you need to install the OpenCTI platform can be found in the official documentation. For installation, you can: Use Docker Install manually Use Terraform (community) Use Helm charts (community) Contributing Code of Conduct OpenCTI has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the full text so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated. Contributing Guide Read our contributing guide to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to OpenCTI. Beginner friendly issues To help you get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of beginner friendly issues which are fairly easy to implement. This is a great place to get started. Development If you want to actively help OpenCTI, we created a dedicated documentation about the deployment of a development environment and how to start the source code modification. Community Status &amp; bugs Currently OpenCTI is under heavy development, if you wish to report bugs or ask for new features, you can directly use the Github issues module. Discussion If you need support or you wish to engage a discussion about the OpenCTI platform, feel free to join us on our Slack channel. You can also send us an email to contact@filigran.io. About Authors OpenCTI is a product designed and developed by the company Filigran. Data Collection Usage telemetry To improve the features and the performances of OpenCTI, the platform collects anonymous statistical data related to its usage and health. You can find all the details on collected data and associated usage in the usage telemetry documentation. OpenStreetMap server To provide OpenCTI users with cartography features, the platform uses a dedicated OpenStreetMap server (https://map.opencti.io). To monitor usage and adapt services performances, Filigran collects access log to this server (including IP addresses). By using this server, you authorize Filigran to collect this information. Otherwise, you are free to deploy your own OpenStreetMap server and modify the platform configuration accordingly. If you have started using the Filigran server and change your mind, you have the right to access, limit, rectify, erase and receive your data. To exercise your rights, please send your request to privacy@filigran.io.

Your own personal AI assistant. Any OS. Any Platform. The lobster way. OpenClaw — Personal AI Assistant EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE! OpenClaw is a personal AI assistant you run on your own devices. It answers you on the channels you already use (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, WebChat), plus extension channels like BlueBubbles, Matrix, Zalo, and Zalo Personal. It can speak and listen on macOS/iOS/Android, and can render a live Canvas you control. The Gateway is just the control plane — the product is the assistant. If you want a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on, this is it. Website · Docs · Vision · DeepWiki · Getting Started · Updating · Showcase · FAQ · Wizard · Nix · Docker · Discord Preferred setup: run the onboarding wizard (openclaw onboard) in your terminal. The wizard guides you step by step through setting up the gateway, workspace, channels, and skills. The CLI wizard is the path and works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL2; strongly ). Works with npm, pnpm, or bun. New install? Start here: Getting started Subscriptions (OAuth): Anthropic (Claude Pro/Max) OpenAI (ChatGPT/Codex) Model note: while any model is supported, I strongly recommend Anthropic Pro/Max (100/200) + Opus 4.6 for long‑context strength and better prompt‑injection resistance. See Onboarding. Models (selection + auth) Models config + CLI: Models Auth profile rotation (OAuth vs API keys) + fallbacks: Model failover Install ( ) Runtime: Node ≥22. npm install -g openclaw@latest
# or: pnpm add -g openclaw@latest openclaw onboard --install-daemon The wizard installs the Gateway daemon (launchd/systemd user service) so it stays running. Quick start (TL;DR) Runtime: Node ≥22. Full beginner guide (auth, pairing, channels): Getting started openclaw onboard --install-daemon openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose # Send a message
openclaw message send --to +1234567890 --message "Hello from OpenClaw" # Talk to the assistant (optionally deliver back to any connected channel: WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Discord/Google Chat/Signal/iMessage/BlueBubbles/Microsoft Teams/Matrix/Zalo/Zalo Personal/WebChat)
openclaw agent --message "Ship checklist" --thinking high Upgrading? Updating guide (and run openclaw doctor). Development channels stable: tagged releases (vYYYY.M.D or vYYYY.M.D-), npm dist-tag latest. beta: prerelease tags (vYYYY.M.D-beta.N), npm dist-tag beta (macOS app may be missing). dev: moving head of main, npm dist-tag dev (when published). Switch channels (git + npm): openclaw update --channel stable|beta|dev. Details: Development channels. From source (development) Prefer pnpm for builds from source. Bun is optional for running TypeScript directly. git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw pnpm install
pnpm ui:build # auto-installs UI deps on first run
pnpm build pnpm openclaw onboard --install-daemon # Dev loop (auto-reload on TS changes)
pnpm gateway:watch Note: pnpm openclaw ... runs TypeScript directly (via tsx). pnpm build produces dist/ for running via Node / the packaged openclaw binary. Security defaults (DM access) OpenClaw connects to real messaging surfaces. Treat inbound DMs as untrusted input. Full security guide: Security Default behavior on Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/Microsoft Teams/Discord/Google Chat/Slack: DM pairing (dmPolicy="pairing" / channels.discord.dmPolicy="pairing" / channels.slack.dmPolicy="pairing"; legacy: channels.discord.dm.policy, channels.slack.dm.policy): unknown senders receive a short pairing code and the bot does not process their message. Approve with: openclaw pairing approve (then the sender is added to a local allowlist store). Public inbound DMs require an explicit opt-in: set dmPolicy="open" and include "*" in the channel allowlist (allowFrom / channels.discord.allowFrom / channels.slack.allowFrom; legacy: channels.discord.dm.allowFrom, channels.slack.dm.allowFrom). Run openclaw doctor to surface risky/misconfigured DM policies. Highlights Local-first Gateway — single control plane for sessions, channels, tools, and events. Multi-channel inbox — WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, BlueBubbles (iMessage), iMessage (legacy), Microsoft Teams, Matrix, Zalo, Zalo Personal, WebChat, macOS, iOS/Android. Multi-agent routing — route inbound channels/accounts/peers to isolated agents (workspaces + per-agent sessions). Voice Wake + Talk Mode — always-on speech for macOS/iOS/Android with ElevenLabs. Live Canvas — agent-driven visual workspace with A2UI. First-class tools — browser, canvas, nodes, cron, sessions, and Discord/Slack actions. Companion apps — macOS menu bar app + iOS/Android nodes. Onboarding + skills — wizard-driven setup with bundled/managed/workspace skills. Star History Everything we built so far Core platform Gateway WS control plane with sessions, presence, config, cron, webhooks, Control UI, and Canvas host. CLI surface: gateway, agent, send, wizard, and doctor. Pi agent runtime in RPC mode with tool streaming and block streaming. Session model: main for direct chats, group isolation, activation modes, queue modes, reply-back. Group rules: Groups. Media pipeline: images/audio/video, transcription hooks, size caps, temp file lifecycle. Audio details: Audio. Channels Channels: WhatsApp (Baileys), Telegram (grammY), Slack (Bolt), Discord (discord.js), Google Chat (Chat API), Signal (signal-cli), BlueBubbles (iMessage, ), iMessage (legacy imsg), Microsoft Teams (extension), Matrix (extension), Zalo (extension), Zalo Personal (extension), WebChat. Group routing: mention gating, reply tags, per-channel chunking and routing. Channel rules: Channels. Apps + nodes macOS app: menu bar control plane, Voice Wake/PTT, Talk Mode overlay, WebChat, debug tools, remote gateway control. iOS node: Canvas, Voice Wake, Talk Mode, camera, screen recording, Bonjour pairing. Android node: Canvas, Talk Mode, camera, screen recording, optional SMS. macOS node mode: system.run/notify + canvas/camera exposure. Tools + automation Browser control: dedicated openclaw Chrome/Chromium, snapshots, actions, uploads, profiles. Canvas: A2UI push/reset, eval, snapshot. Nodes: camera snap/clip, screen record, location.get, notifications. Cron + wakeups; webhooks; Gmail Pub/Sub. Skills platform: bundled, managed, and workspace skills with install gating + UI. Runtime + safety Channel routing, retry policy, and streaming/chunking. Presence, typing indicators, and usage tracking. Models, model failover, and session pruning. Security and troubleshooting. Ops + packaging Control UI + WebChat served directly from the Gateway. Tailscale Serve/Funnel or SSH tunnels with token/password auth. Nix mode for declarative config; Docker-based installs. Doctor migrations, logging. How it works (short) WhatsApp / Telegram / Slack / Discord / Google Chat / Signal / iMessage / BlueBubbles / Microsoft Teams / Matrix / Zalo / Zalo Personal / WebChat │ ▼

└──────────────┬────────────────┘ │ ├─ Pi agent (RPC) ├─ CLI (openclaw …) ├─ WebChat UI ├─ macOS app └─ iOS / Android nodes Key subsystems Gateway WebSocket network — single WS control plane for clients, tools, and events (plus ops: Gateway runbook). Tailscale exposure — Serve/Funnel for the Gateway dashboard + WS (remote access: Remote). Browser control — openclaw‑managed Chrome/Chromium with CDP control. Canvas + A2UI — agent‑driven visual workspace (A2UI host: Canvas/A2UI). Voice Wake + Talk Mode — always‑on speech and continuous conversation. Nodes — Canvas, camera snap/clip, screen record, location.get, notifications, plus macOS‑only system.run/system.notify. Tailscale access (Gateway dashboard) OpenClaw can auto-configure Tailscale Serve (tailnet-only) or Funnel (public) while the Gateway stays bound to loopback. Configure gateway.tailscale.mode: off: no Tailscale automation (default). serve: tailnet-only HTTPS via tailscale serve (uses Tailscale identity headers by default). funnel: public HTTPS via tailscale funnel (requires shared password auth). Notes: gateway.bind must stay loopback when Serve/Funnel is enabled (OpenClaw enforces this). Serve can be forced to require a password by setting gateway.auth.mode: "password" or gateway.auth.allowTailscale: false. Funnel refuses to start unless gateway.auth.mode: "password" is set. Optional: gateway.tailscale.resetOnExit to undo Serve/Funnel on shutdown. Details: Tailscale guide · Web surfaces Remote Gateway (Linux is great) It’s perfectly fine to run the Gateway on a small Linux instance. Clients (macOS app, CLI, WebChat) can connect over Tailscale Serve/Funnel or SSH tunnels, and you can still pair device nodes (macOS/iOS/Android) to execute device‑local actions when needed. Gateway host runs the exec tool and channel connections by default. Device nodes run device‑local actions (system.run, camera, screen recording, notifications) via node.invoke. In short: exec runs where the Gateway lives; device actions run where the device lives. Details: Remote access · Nodes · Security macOS permissions via the Gateway protocol The macOS app can run in node mode and advertises its capabilities + permission map over the Gateway WebSocket (node.list / node.describe). Clients can then execute local actions via node.invoke: system.run runs a local command and returns stdout/stderr/exit code; set needsScreenRecording: true to require screen-recording permission (otherwise you’ll get PERMISSION_MISSING). system.notify posts a user notification and fails if notifications are denied. canvas.*, camera.*, screen.record, and location.get are also routed via node.invoke and follow TCC permission status. Elevated bash (host permissions) is separate from macOS TCC: Use /elevated on|off to toggle per‑session elevated access when enabled + allowlisted. Gateway persists the per‑session toggle via sessions.patch (WS method) alongside thinkingLevel, verboseLevel, model, sendPolicy, and groupActivation. Details: Nodes · macOS app · Gateway protocol Agent to Agent (sessions_* tools) Use these to coordinate work across sessions without jumping between chat surfaces. sessions_list — discover active sessions (agents) and their metadata. sessions_history — fetch transcript logs for a session. sessions_send — message another session; optional reply‑back ping‑pong + announce step (REPLY_SKIP, ANNOUNCE_SKIP). Details: Session tools Skills registry (ClawHub) ClawHub is a minimal skill registry. With ClawHub enabled, the agent can search for skills automatically and pull in new ones as needed. ClawHub Chat commands Send these in WhatsApp/Telegram/Slack/Google Chat/Microsoft Teams/WebChat (group commands are owner-only): /status — compact session status (model + tokens, cost when available) /new or /reset — reset the session /compact — compact session context (summary) /think — off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh (GPT-5.2 + Codex models only) /verbose on|off /usage off|tokens|full — per-response usage footer /restart — restart the gateway (owner-only in groups) /activation mention|always — group activation toggle (groups only) Apps (optional) The Gateway alone delivers a great experience. All apps are optional and add extra features. If you plan to build/run companion apps, follow the platform runbooks below. macOS (OpenClaw.app) (optional) Menu bar control for the Gateway and health. Voice Wake + push-to-talk overlay. WebChat + debug tools. Remote gateway control over SSH. Note: signed builds required for macOS permissions to stick across rebuilds (see docs/mac/permissions.md). iOS node (optional) Pairs as a node via the Bridge. Voice trigger forwarding + Canvas surface. Controlled via openclaw nodes …. Runbook: iOS connect. Android node (optional) Pairs via the same Bridge + pairing flow as iOS. Exposes Canvas, Camera, and Screen capture commands. Runbook: Android connect. Agent workspace + skills Workspace root: ~/.openclaw/workspace (configurable via agents.defaults.workspace). Injected prompt files: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md. Skills: ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills//SKILL.md. Configuration Minimal ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json (model + defaults): { agent: { model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6", },
} Full configuration reference (all keys + examples). Security model (important) Default: tools run on the host for the main session, so the agent has full access when it’s just you. Group/channel safety: set agents.defaults.sandbox.mode: "non-main" to run non‑main sessions (groups/channels) inside per‑session Docker sandboxes; bash then runs in Docker for those sessions. Sandbox defaults: allowlist bash, process, read, write, edit, sessions_list, sessions_history, sessions_send, sessions_spawn; denylist browser, canvas, nodes, cron, discord, gateway. Details: Security guide · Docker + sandboxing · Sandbox config WhatsApp Link the device: pnpm openclaw channels login (stores creds in ~/.openclaw/credentials). Allowlist who can talk to the assistant via channels.whatsapp.allowFrom. If channels.whatsapp.groups is set, it becomes a group allowlist; include "*" to allow all. Telegram Set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN or channels.telegram.botToken (env wins). Optional: set channels.telegram.groups (with channels.telegram.groups."*".requireMention); when set, it is a group allowlist (include "*" to allow all). Also channels.telegram.allowFrom or channels.telegram.webhookUrl + channels.telegram.webhookSecret as needed. { channels: { telegram: { botToken: "123456:ABCDEF", }, },
} Slack Set SLACK_BOT_TOKEN + SLACK_APP_TOKEN (or channels.slack.botToken + channels.slack.appToken). Discord Set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN or channels.discord.token (env wins). Optional: set commands.native, commands.text, or commands.useAccessGroups, plus channels.discord.allowFrom, channels.discord.guilds, or channels.discord.mediaMaxMb as needed. { channels: { discord: { token: "1234abcd", }, },
} Signal Requires signal-cli and a channels.signal config section. BlueBubbles (iMessage) iMessage integration. Configure channels.bluebubbles.serverUrl + channels.bluebubbles.password and a webhook (channels.bluebubbles.webhookPath). The BlueBubbles server runs on macOS; the Gateway can run on macOS or elsewhere. iMessage (legacy) Legacy macOS-only integration via imsg (Messages must be signed in). If channels.imessage.groups is set, it becomes a group allowlist; include "*" to allow all. Microsoft Teams Configure a Teams app + Bot Framework, then add a msteams config section. Allowlist who can talk via msteams.allowFrom; group access via msteams.groupAllowFrom or msteams.groupPolicy: "open". WebChat Uses the Gateway WebSocket; no separate WebChat port/config. Browser control (optional): { browser: { enabled: true, color: "#FF4500", },

### 15. `EN` [Inside OpenClaw: How a Persistent AI Agent Actually Works](data/articles/7cfae8f42399af6c18b63e7ee7be2246.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
Introduction OpenClaw, originally called ClawdBot, is trending everywhere. People are building insane things with it: an AI agent that rebuilds an entire website via Telegram, an AI agent platform where humans are only guests, and giving one AI full access to your system that can accidentally delete 6,000 emails because of a prompt injection attack.
Unlike ChatGPT or Claude sitting behind a web interface, OpenClaw runs as a persistent process on your hardware. You message it through WhatsApp, Telegram, or Slack. It messages you back. It can check things while you sleep. It has access to your filesystem, your terminal, and whatever APIs you give it.
The possibilities are wild. The security risks are real. And the technical architecture behind it explains both, and it's simpler than you'd think. Let's see how it actually works.
Gateway Architecture: The Central Nervous System OpenClaw runs as a single Node.js process on your machine, listening on 127.0.0.1:18789 by default. This process is called the Gateway, which manages every messaging platform connection simultaneously: WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, and others.
Think of it as the central nervous system. Every message coming in from any platform passes through the Gateway. Every response your agent generates goes back out through it. All communication happens via WebSocket protocol, which keeps connections open and allows real-time bidirectional messaging. Session State, Routing, and Security The Gateway handles three critical functions:
session state management,
message routing, and
security enforcement.
When a message arrives from WhatsApp, the Gateway determines which agent session should handle it based on the user, conversation context, or routing rules you've configured. It loads the appropriate session state, passes the message to the agent, waits for the LLM to generate a response, then routes that response back through the correct platform connection.
This centralized design solves a real technical problem. WhatsApp Web only allows one active session at a time. If you try running multiple instances, they conflict and kick each other off. The Gateway acts as that single session, then manages multiple agent conversations internally. Configure WhatsApp once, and the Gateway handles everything downstream. The same principle applies to every other platform.
Connection and Authentication Flow When a platform wants to connect, it establishes a WebSocket connection and sends a connect request with device identity, basically, "I'm WhatsApp running on device XYZ, and I want to talk to your agent." The Gateway checks its pairing store. If this device has never connected before, it rejects the connection and waits for explicit approval.
Once approved, the Gateway issues a device token scoped to specific permissions. That token determines what this device can do:
which users it can message as,
which agent sessions it can access, and
what capabilities it has.
Future connections use this token for authentication instead of requiring re-approval every time.
Once a platform is authenticated, every message it sends goes through routing logic. The Gateway decides where the message goes and whether the agent should respond based on rules you configure:
Messages from users on your allow list get processed
Messages from unknown users get dropped before the agent sees them
DMs route to your personal assistant agent
Group chats might only trigger responses when someone @mentions the agent directly
Network Binding: Local by Default All this routing and authentication happens on your local machine. The Gateway binds to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) by default, not 0.0.0.0 (all network interfaces). This network binding determines who can connect to the Gateway in the first place.
Binding to 127.0.0.1 means only processes running on your machine can reach the Gateway, no external network access. Your agent isn't accessible from outside your machine unless you deliberately reconfigure the binding. This prevents accidental public exposure, a critical consideration given the Gateway has access to your filesystem, terminal, and connected APIs.
Every message follows the same path:
platform → Gateway authentication → routing logic → agent session load → LLM processing → response generation → Gateway → platform delivery. One process. All platforms. Centralized control. And everything stays local unless you explicitly decide otherwise.
Now that we understand how messages reach the agent, let's look at what happens once they get there.
The Agent Loop: From Message to Action When a message hits the Gateway, it doesn't just forward blindly to an LLM. There's a processing cycle that turns your "check my calendar" into an actual response with context. The Gateway routes the message to the appropriate agent session based on who sent it and where it came from. That session loads conversation history from the file system, everything you've said to this agent in the past, not just this conversation, but previous ones too. This is why your agent remembers you asked about a project last Tuesday.
The agent passes the message to the LLM along with available tools and skills. The model processes the request, decides if it needs to call a tool (like checking your calendar or sending an email), executes those actions, and generates a response. That response streams back through the Gateway to whichever platform you messaged from.
Context That Persists Unlike a fresh ChatGPT conversation every time, OpenClaw sessions don't reset. The agent knows who you are, what you've asked before, and what's in your workspace. If you told it last week that you're working on Project XYZ, it remembers. If you saved notes in your workspace, it can reference them.
This persistence happens because everything stays in files on your machine. The agent reloads context every time it processes a message, but that context doesn't disappear when you close the chat. And you're not locked to one LLM, configure Claude for complex reasoning, GPT-4 for creative tasks, or a cheaper model for simple queries. The agent loop works the same regardless.
This file-based approach to memory is what makes the persistence possible. Let's look at how that actually works.
Persistent Memory: Everything is a File OpenClaw doesn't use a database. Everything is stored ~/clawd/ as Markdown files.
Your agent's behavior is defined in AGENTS.md. Its personality and core instructions are stored in SOUL.md. Available tools are listed in TOOLS.md. Skills you've installed are saved in ~/clawd/skills//SKILL.md. Memory logs are timestamped files with names like 2026-02-10-conversation.md.
Open any text editor, and you see exactly what your agent knows. Want to check what it remembers about your last project discussion? Open the memory log. Want to modify how it responds to calendar requests? Edit AGENTS.md. Want to see what tools it has access to? Read TOOLS.md. Since everything is plain text, version control works without extra setup. Run git init in ~/clawd/ and every change gets tracked. You can see when you added a new skill[we’ll learn about this in upcoming sections], when the agent updated its long-term memory, or when you modified its core instructions. If something breaks, roll back to a previous commit. Backups are simple, just copy the directory.
How Memory Organizes Itself OpenClaw separates memory into layers. Daily logs capture short-term context, what you talked about today, what tasks are in progress, and what links you shared. These timestamped files accumulate over time.
Long-term memory is curated by the agent itself. As conversations happen, the agent decides what's important enough to remember permanently. Maybe you told it you prefer concise responses. Maybe you gave it standing instructions about how to handle certain types of requests. That information gets written to long-term memory files and persists across sessions.
If you're analyzing a dataset and your computer crashes, the agent reloads workspace state when it comes back up. It knows where you left off because that state lives in a file it can read on restart.
But memory alone doesn't make an agent proactive. For that, OpenClaw needs a mechanism to wake up and check things without you asking. That's where the heartbeat comes in.
Heartbeat: The Proactive Agent Most AI assistants wait for you to ask a question. OpenClaw doesn't have to.
A cron job wakes your agent at whatever interval you configure, the default is every 30 minutes. The agent checks HEARTBEAT.md for instructions, runs a reasoning loop, and decides if it needs to tell you something. No prompt required. This is how you get proactive notifications. Your server goes down at 3 am, and the agent messages you on Telegram. A stock you're monitoring drops 15%, it executes a sell order, and confirms via WhatsApp. Three urgent emails from a client arrive, and it flags them immediately instead of waiting for you to check.
Cheap Checks First OpenClaw doesn't call the LLM on every heartbeat(as you can see in the above image). That would burn through API costs fast. Instead, it uses a two-tier approach: cheap checks first, models only when needed.
The agent runs fast, deterministic scripts first, checking for new emails, calendar changes, or system alerts. These are simple pattern matches or API queries that cost nothing. Only when something significant changes does the agent escalate to the LLM for interpretation and decision-making.
For example, the cheap check sees "new email from landlord." That's a signal. The agent then calls Claude or GPT-4 to read the email, understand context from previous conversations about your lease, and decide if it needs to notify you or take action. If the heartbeat finds nothing new, no LLM call happens.
This design keeps costs reasonable while maintaining responsiveness. You're not paying for 48 LLM calls per day when nothing important is happening.
Configuration The configuration for HEARTBEAT.md:
textevery: "30m"
target: "whatsapp:+1234567890"
active_hours: "9am-10pm" The active_hours setting prevents your agent from waking you at 2 am with non-urgent updates.
The target specifies which platform and contact to send heartbeat messages to.
The every parameter controls frequency, set it to "1h" for standard monitoring, "15m" for tighter checks if you're actively working, or "5m" if you need a near-real-time response.
Each heartbeat cycle loads the agent's current context, checks for conditions defined in the heartbeat instructions, and only sends a message if something actually needs attention. It's not spamming you every 30 minutes, it's checking every 30 minutes and speaking up when there's a reason.
This proactive capability is built in, but you can extend what the agent actually does during those checks. That's where skills come in.
Skills &amp; Execution: Extending Agent Capabilities OpenClaw uses a skill-based architecture where capabilities are defined in Markdown files, not compiled code.
Each skill is present as ~/clawd/skills//SKILL.md and contains instructions for interacting with APIs or performing workflows. The agent reads these files at runtime to understand available capabilities. Installation is immediate, no recompilation or server restarts. Over 100 community skills exist on ClawHub for Gmail, browser automation, home control, and more. Execution Model Skills execute wherever the OpenClaw process runs, your local machine, a VPS, or a managed container. The architecture stays identical: Gateway routes messages, agent loads skills from the filesystem, LLM calls happen directly (not proxied through a vendor), and results write back to local storage.

Direct from agent Tool restrictions set limits at the Gateway level. You can run the agent in sandboxed mode (restricted capabilities for safety) or full access mode (unrestricted system control). In sandboxed mode, it blocks writing to the filesystem and shell access. Full access mode lets you use terminal commands and control the browser. If the LLM tries to do something it's not allowed to, the Gateway stops it before it happens.
Regardless of where the process runs, connecting to messaging platforms requires authentication and security enforcement. That's where the Gateway's role becomes critical.
Security &amp; Multi-Platform Handling The Gateway enforces security at the routing layer, not just at connection time.
Once platforms are authenticated and connected, every message goes through security checks before reaching the agent. Allow lists control which users or groups get responses. If someone not on the list sends a message, the Gateway drops it before the agent sees it. This works across all platforms: WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, using the same allow-list configuration. How Multi-Platform Routing Works The Channel Layer sits between platform connections and the agent. WhatsApp messages arrive in one format, Telegram in another, Discord in a third. The Channel Layer adapts these to a common internal structure so the agent doesn't need platform-specific code. It also handles platform events like reactions, typing indicators, and read receipts.
This abstraction means you can write one routing rule that applies to all platforms. "Only respond to @mentions in group chats" works the same whether the message came from Slack or Discord. The Channel Layer translates platform-specific mention formats into a standard structure that the Gateway understands.
Security Architecture: Layered Restrictions OpenClaw's architecture assumes the LLM can be tricked. Prompt injection attacks are real, the architecture can't prevent them at the LLM level, so it limits damage through multiple enforcement layers:
Tool approval workflows gate dangerous operations (file deletion, shell commands, payments) with explicit user confirmation
Scoped permissions separate read and write access (read emails vs send emails, query database vs modify database)
Device token capabilities restrict what each connected device can do (DMs only, no group chats, read-only mode)
One compromised conversation shouldn't give access to everything. These layers don't stop a determined attacker who controls what the LLM reads, but they slow them down enough to notice and intervene. The 6,000-email deletion incident from the intro wasn't a design flaw, it demonstrated why these restrictions matter and why running an AI agent with full system access requires understanding the risks.
The architecture gives you control:
choose which platforms connect,
which users get responses,
which tools are available, and
which operations require approval.
That control is the tradeoff for running a persistent agent with access to your systems.
OpenClaw's architecture is surprisingly simple: a Gateway routes messages, an agent loop processes them with LLM and tools, memory is persisted as files, skills extend capabilities, and a heartbeat runs proactive checks. No database, no microservices, no vendor lock-in. The design choices, file-based memory, Markdown skills, local execution, assumption of compromise, prioritize transparency and control over convenience. You see exactly what your agent knows, what it can do, and where it runs. The tradeoff is that you manage the infrastructure and accept the security risks that come with giving an AI access to your systems.
What makes OpenClaw interesting isn't revolutionary technology. It's the combination of persistent execution, proactive behavior, multi-platform integration, and modular capabilities in an architecture you can inspect and modify. Whether that's worth running depends on what you're building and how much control you need.

### 17. `EN` [p-e-w/heretic](data/articles/d2f39386e20eb773456e12229344aa68.html)
**Source:** GitHub Trending | **Keyword:** `GitHub`
Fully automatic censorship removal for language models Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models Heretic is a tool that removes censorship (aka "safety alignment") from transformer-based language models without expensive post-training. It combines an advanced implementation of directional ablation, also known as "abliteration" (Arditi et al. 2024, Lai 2025 (1, 2)), with a TPE-based parameter optimizer powered by Optuna. This approach enables Heretic to work completely automatically. Heretic finds high-quality abliteration parameters by co-minimizing the number of refusals and the KL divergence from the original model. This results in a decensored model that retains as much of the original model's intelligence as possible. Using Heretic does not require an understanding of transformer internals. In fact, anyone who knows how to run a command-line program can use Heretic to decensor language models. Running unsupervised with the default configuration, Heretic can produce decensored models that rival the quality of abliterations created manually by human experts: Model Refusals for "harmful" prompts KL divergence from original model for "harmless" prompts google/gemma-3-12b-it (original) 97/100 0 (by definition) mlabonne/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2 3/100 1.04 huihui-ai/gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated 3/100 0.45 p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic (ours) 3/100 0.16 The Heretic version, generated without any human effort, achieves the same level of refusal suppression as other abliterations, but at a much lower KL divergence, indicating less damage to the original model's capabilities. (You can reproduce those numbers using Heretic's built-in evaluation functionality, e.g. heretic --model google/gemma-3-12b-it --evaluate-model p-e-w/gemma-3-12b-it-heretic. Note that the exact values might be platform- and hardware-dependent. The table above was compiled using PyTorch 2.8 on an RTX 5090.) Of course, mathematical metrics and automated benchmarks never tell the whole story, and are no substitute for human evaluation. Models generated with Heretic have been well-received by users (links and emphasis added): "I was skeptical before, but I just downloaded GPT-OSS 20B Heretic model and holy shit. It gives properly formatted long responses to sensitive topics, using the exact uncensored words that you would expect from an uncensored model, produces markdown format tables with details and whatnot. Looks like this is the best abliterated version of this model so far..." (Link to ) "Heretic GPT 20b seems to be the best uncensored model I have tried yet. It doesn't destroy a the model's intelligence and it is answering prompts normally would be rejected by the base model." (Link to ) "[Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-heretic] Has been the best unquantized abliterated model that I have been able to run on 16gb vram." (Link to ) Heretic supports most dense models, including many multimodal models, and several different MoE architectures. It does not yet support SSMs/hybrid models, models with inhomogeneous layers, and certain novel attention systems. You can find a small collection of models that have been decensored using Heretic on Hugging Face, and the community has created and published well over 1,000 Heretic models in addition to those. Usage Prepare a Python 3.10+ environment with PyTorch 2.2+ installed as appropriate for your hardware. Then run: pip install -U heretic-llm
heretic Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 Replace Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 with whatever model you want to decensor. The process is fully automatic and does not require configuration; however, Heretic has a variety of configuration parameters that can be changed for greater control. Run heretic --help to see available command-line options, or look at config.default.toml if you prefer to use a configuration file. At the start of a program run, Heretic benchmarks the system to determine the optimal batch size to make the most of the available hardware. On an RTX 3090, with the default configuration, decensoring Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct takes about 45 minutes. Note that Heretic supports model quantization with bitsandbytes, which can drastically reduce the amount of VRAM required to process models. Set the quantization option to bnb_4bit to enable quantization. After Heretic has finished decensoring a model, you are given the option to save the model, upload it to Hugging Face, chat with it to test how well it works, or any combination of those actions. Research features In addition to its primary function of removing model censorship, Heretic also provides features designed to support research into the semantics of model internals (interpretability). To use those features, you need to install Heretic with the optional research extra: pip install -U heretic-llm[research] This gives you access to the following functionality: Generate plots of residual vectors by passing --plot-residuals When run with this flag, Heretic will: Compute residual vectors (hidden states) for the first output token, for each transformer layer, for both "harmful" and "harmless" prompts. Perform a PaCMAP projection from residual space to 2D-space. Left-right align the projections of "harmful"/"harmless" residuals by their geometric medians to make projections for consecutive layers more similar. Additionally, PaCMAP is initialized with the previous layer's projections for each new layer, minimizing disruptive transitions. Scatter-plot the projections, generating a PNG image for each layer. Generate an animation showing how residuals transform between layers, as an animated GIF. See the configuration file for options that allow you to control various aspects of the generated plots. Note that PaCMAP is an expensive operation that is performed on the CPU. For larger models, it can take an hour or more to compute projections for all layers. Print details about residual geometry by passing --print-residual-geometry If you are interested in a quantitative analysis of how residual vectors for "harmful" and "harmless" prompts relate to each other, this flag gives you the following table, packed with metrics that can facilitate understanding the same (for gemma-3-270m-it in this case): ┏━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓

Silh = Mean silhouette coefficient of residuals for good/bad clusters How Heretic works Heretic implements a parametrized variant of directional ablation. For each supported transformer component (currently, attention out-projection and MLP down-projection), it identifies the associated matrices in each transformer layer, and orthogonalizes them with respect to the relevant "refusal direction", inhibiting the expression of that direction in the result of multiplications with that matrix. Refusal directions are computed for each layer as a difference-of-means between the first-token residuals for "harmful" and "harmless" example prompts. The ablation process is controlled by several optimizable parameters: direction_index: Either the index of a refusal direction, or the special value per layer, indicating that each layer should be ablated using the refusal direction associated with that layer. max_weight, max_weight_position, min_weight, and min_weight_distance: For each component, these parameters describe the shape and position of the ablation weight kernel over the layers. The following diagram illustrates this: Heretic's main innovations over existing abliteration systems are: The shape of the ablation weight kernel is highly flexible, which, combined with automatic parameter optimization, can improve the compliance/quality tradeoff. Non-constant ablation weights were previously explored by Maxime Labonne in gemma-3-12b-it-abliterated-v2. The refusal direction index is a float rather than an integer. For non-integral values, the two nearest refusal direction vectors are linearly interpolated. This unlocks a vast space of additional directions beyond the ones identified by the difference-of-means computation, and often enables the optimization process to find a better direction than that belonging to any individual layer. Ablation parameters are chosen separately for each component. I have found that MLP interventions tend to be more damaging to the model than attention interventions, so using different ablation weights can squeeze out some extra performance. Prior art I'm aware of the following publicly available implementations of abliteration techniques: AutoAbliteration abliterator.py wassname's Abliterator ErisForge Removing refusals with HF Transformers deccp Note that Heretic was written from scratch, and does not reuse code from any of those projects. Acknowledgments The development of Heretic was informed by: The original abliteration paper (Arditi et al. 2024) Maxime Labonne's article on abliteration, as well as some details from the model cards of his own abliterated models (see above) Jim Lai's articles describing "projected abliteration" and "norm-preserving biprojected abliteration" Citation If you use Heretic for your research, please cite it using the following BibTeX entry: @misc{heretic, author = {Weidmann, Philipp Emanuel}, title = {Heretic: Fully automatic censorship removal for language models}, year = {2025}, publisher = {GitHub}, journal = {GitHub repository}, howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/p-e-w/heretic}}

Mission The world is rushing to build AI systems. It is not engineering them. That gap is what we mean by AI engineering. AI engineering is the discipline of building efficient, reliable, safe, and robust intelligent systems that operate in the real world, not just models in isolation. Our mission: Establish AI engineering as a foundational discipline, alongside software engineering and computer engineering, by teaching how to design, build, and evaluate end to end intelligent systems. The long term impact of AI will be shaped by engineers who can turn ideas into working, dependable systems. What’s in this repo This repository is the open learning stack for AI systems engineering. It includes the textbook source, TinyTorch, hardware kits, and upcoming co-labs that connect principles to runnable code and real devices. Start Here Choose a path based on your goal. READ Start with the textbook. Try Chapter 1 and the Benchmarking chapter. BUILD Start TinyTorch with the getting started guide. Begin with Module 01 and work up from CNNs to transformers and the MLPerf benchmarks. DEPLOY Pick a hardware kit and run the labs on Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and other edge devices. CONNECT Say hello in Discussions. We will do our best to reply. The Learning Stack The learning stack below shows how the textbook connects to hands on work and deployment.

Trust Making it right Responsible AI, Sustainable AI, AI for Good VI. Frontiers What's next Emerging trends and future directions What Makes This Different This is a living textbook. We keep it updated as the field grows, with community input along the way. AI may feel like it is moving at lightning speed, but the engineering building blocks that make it work do not change as quickly as the headlines. This project is built around those stable foundations. Think of it like LEGO. New sets arrive all the time, but the bricks themselves stay the same. Once you learn how the bricks fit together, you can build anything. Here, those "AI bricks" are the solid systems principles that make AI work. Whether you are reading a chapter, running a lab, or sharing feedback, you are helping make these ideas more accessible to the next learner. Research to Teaching Loop We use the same loop for research and teaching: define the system problem, build a reference implementation, benchmark it, then turn it into curriculum and tooling so others can reproduce and extend it. Loop Step Research Artifacts Teaching Artifacts Measure Benchmarks, suites, metrics Benchmarking chapter, assignments Build Reference systems, compilers, runtimes TinyTorch modules, co-labs Deploy Hardware targets, constraints, reliability Hardware labs, kits Support This Work We are working toward 1 million learners by 2030 so that AI engineering becomes a shared, teachable discipline, not a collection of isolated practices. Every star, share, and contribution helps move this effort forward. Why GitHub Stars Matter What gets measured gets improved. Each star is a learner, educator, or supporter who believes AI systems should be engineered with rigor and real world constraints in mind. 1 learner → 10 learners → 100 learners → 1,000 learners → 10,000 learners → 100,000 learners → 1M learners Stars are not the goal. They are a signal. A visible, growing community makes it easier for universities, foundations, and industry partners to adopt this material, donate hardware, and fund workshops. That momentum lowers the barrier for the next institution, the next classroom, and the next cohort of learners. Support raised through this signal flows into Open Collective and funds concrete outcomes such as TinyML4D workshops, hardware kits for underserved classrooms, and the infrastructure required to keep this resource free and open. One click can unlock the next classroom, the next contributor, and the next generation of AI engineers.

**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
so I've been learning python for a while and I finally built something I'm actually proud of
it's called Sentinel — a system monitor for Linux. it's crazy, just something I wanted to exist that wasn't a terminal app or bloated with electron. it's built with GTK4 and psutil so it's genuinely lightweight (~20MB RAM usage)
it does:
live CPU, RAM, swap, disk and network graphs on a dashboard
per-core CPU breakdown
full process manager where you can search by name or PID and kill processes
memory breakdown (used/cached/buffers/free)
network interface info + session totals
settings for refresh rate, graph history length, temp unit etc
ships as a .deb so installation is pretty straightforward. runs on anything with GTK4 in its repos (basically any distro from 2021+), even old hardware
it's my first actual release so it's not perfect but it works well and I'm gonna keep adding to it

would love any feedback, especially if something breaks on your setup .

### 20. `EN` [Stop duct-taping your Python scripts: Handle Scheduling and Versioning natively](data/articles/8c6b2611c91ea987bddd15d3e4505db7.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
TL;DR Building a great model in Python is fast. But turning that script into a reliable, multi-user application usually involves writing manual "glue code," duct-taping Linux cron jobs, and crossing your fingers during updates. What if you could bypass the "Day 2" operational wall and handle background scheduling and versioning entirely natively? Enter Taipy: an open-source Python framework that lets you build production-ready data applications without forcing you to become a full-time DevOps engineer.
If you find this open-source project helpful, don't forget to show your support! Star the repo The Need for an Alternative to "Glue Code" We all know the pattern. You build a fast prototype (sales forecasting, optimization, etc.) and it runs perfectly on your machine. Then, the business team needs it every day. Suddenly, your simple script turns into an operational monster:
• The Scheduling Nightmare: • The Versioning Chaos: This is the transition from a prototype to a shared application. Let's look at how Taipy solves these architectural bottlenecks natively.
Executing Machine Learning or optimization models takes time. Taipy now lets you run background computations automatically through a clean, built-in scheduling API.
Instead of relying on an external system, scheduling becomes part of your application model. You can set your scenarios to run overnight or hourly without blocking the app.
• Total Decoupling: The UI stays lightning-fast even if a 4-hour computation is running in the background.
• Overnight Updates: Forecasts and simulations refresh automatically, so decision-makers start the day with up-to-date insights.
• Zero "Glue Code": Reduce manual run steps and brittle external scripts.
Once people depend on your app, updates start to feel risky. Taipy provides built-in version management so you can track exactly what changed and why, right from the core.
It preserves traceability between your development, testing, and production environments. You avoid the situation where the safest option is doing nothing because nobody wants to break what already works.
• Absolute Traceability: You preserve the link between your logic, the data ingested, and the results produced.
• Stress-Free Deployments: Safely evolve your applications as usage grows and more users rely on the results.
• Built-in Governance: Seamlessly move from an isolated "experiment script" to a governed system.
Reading about architecture is great, but seeing it in code is better. Register for the April 9 Webinar here This is a 100% technical, developer-first session shaped directly by questions from our Discord community. No marketing slides, no sales pitch. • The Code: How to implement the Automated Scheduler and Built-In Version Management.
• End-to-End Tracking: How to monitor scenario and data node events so you aren't guessing how people use your app.
• Real-World Demos: We'll look at high-performance decision applications used by Taipy customer teams who handle massive datasets without browser bottlenecks. Register for the April 9 Webinar here Register for the April 9 Webinar here

Vous voulez vous engager pour une cause, rencontrer de nouvelles personnes et découvrir la cartographie participative et humanitaire? CartONG vous invite à participer à un ou plusieurs mapathons en ligne! ​​
Venez cartographier les régions encore absentes des cartes pour soutenir les organisations humanitaires et de solidarité internationale qui ont besoin de cartes précises et à jour pour agir plus efficacement en cas de crise ou initier des projets de développement local.
Les ateliers de cartographie sont organisés dans le cadre du projet Missing Maps, qui a pour objectif de cartographier de façon préventive les régions vulnérables aux catastrophes naturelles, crises sanitaires, environnementales, aux conflits et à la pauvreté. On peut penser qu’aujourd’hui toutes les parties du monde sont cartographiées, mais en réalité de nombreuses régions ne possèdent encore aucune carte!
​ Pour qui? Pas besoin d’être un·e expert·e, les ateliers sont accessibles à tout le monde!
​ Où ? 100% en ligne! Un lien de connexion vous sera envoyé après votre inscription
​ ? Avec la plateforme de cartographie libre et contributive OpenStreetMap (OSM, le «Wikipédia des cartes») tout le monde peut participer à la cartographie de n’importe quelle zone de la planète: il suffit d’un ordinateur, d’une souris et d’une connexion internet! Accessibles à tout·es, nous serons là pour vous accompagner pour vos premiers pas avec OSM.
Le programme des mapathons
18h00: Introduction, présentation de la cartographie collaborative et solidaire et démonstration OSM pour les nouveaux·elles
18h30: On cartographie tous ensemble sur un projet
20h00: Fin du mapathon, conclusion sur les contributions de la soirée

gull, paulla, logiciels-libres, projets, futur, assemblée-générale [FR Paris] Soirée de contribution au libre – Le jeudi 12 février 2026 de 19h30 à 22h00.
Le but des soirées de contribution au libre est de proposer un espace de travail partagé aux personnes actives dans le libre en Île-de-France le temps d’une soirée, une fois par mois (le deuxième jeudi du mois plus précisément).
Dit plus court: c’est un lieu avec de l’électricité et une connexion internet. En avant les claviers !
Les soirées de contribution au libre sont faites pour vous si:
vous travaillez sur un projet libre et vous recherchez une atmosphère à la fois conviviale et studieuse pour aller de l’avant et, qui sait, créer des connexions avec d’autres projets libres, vous êtes un collectif autour du libre et vous cherchez un lieu pour vous retrouver physiquement et avancer avec efficacité sur vos chantiers. Si vous n’avez pas envie de contribuer à un projet libre, les soirées de contribution au libre ne sont sans doute pas faites pour vous. Pas de panique, Parinux organise d’autres évènements:
si vous voulez discuter autour du libre: l’Apéro du Libre (APL) est là pour ça ; c’est un rendez-vous fixé tous les 15 du mois ; venez-nous retrouver autour d’un verre pour papoter et refaire le monde (libre), si vous avez un problème informatique: c’est la vocation de Premiers Samedi du Libre (PSL) où vous pourrez trouver des oreilles attentives et compétentes à l’écoute de toutes vos questions. Nous nous réservons le droit de refuser l’entrée aux soirées de contribution au libre à tout personne qui n’en respecterait pas l’esprit. Et, bien sûr, les règles de bienséance habituelles s’appliquent pour que chacune et chacun se sente à l’aise dans un cadre bienveillant.
Si les soirées de contribution vous intéressent, le mieux est de contacter d’abord le CA de Parinux ca@parinux.org. Vous devrez de toute façon nous écrire pour obtenir le code de la porte cochère…

Marshalling / communication library for drones. MAVLink MAVLink -- Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library. MAVLink is a very lightweight, header-only message library for communication between drones and/or ground control stations. It consists primarily of message-set specifications for different systems ("dialects") defined in XML files, and Python tools that convert these into appropriate source code for supported languages. There are additional Python scripts providing examples and utilities for working with MAVLink data. Tip MAVLink is very well suited for applications with very limited communication bandwidth. Its reference implementation in C is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. It is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers. Quick start Generate C headers To install the minimal MAVLink environment on Ubuntu LTS 20.04 or 22.04, enter the following on a terminal: # Dependencies
sudo apt install python3-pip # Clone mavlink into the directory of your choice
git clone https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink.git --recursive
cd mavlink python3 -m pip install -r pymavlink/requirements.txt You can then build the MAVLink2 C-library for message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml from the /mavlink directory as shown: python3 -m pymavlink.tools.mavgen --lang=C --wire-protocol=2.0 --output=generated/include/mavlink/v2.0 message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml Use from cmake To include the headers in cmake, install them locally, e.g. into the directory install: cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -DMAVLINK_DIALECT=common -DMAVLINK_VERSION=2.0
cmake --build build --target install Then use find_package to get the dependency in CMakeLists.txt: find_package(MAVLink REQUIRED) add_executable(my_program my_program.c) target_link_libraries(my_program PRIVATE MAVLink::mavlink) And pass the local install directory to cmake (adapt to your directory structure): cd ../my_program
cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=../mavlink/install For a full example, check examples/c. Note: even though we use target_link_libraries in cmake, it doesn't actually "link" to MAVLink as it's just a header-only library. Other instructions Instructions for using the C libraries are then covered in Using C MAVLink Libraries (mavgen). Note: Installing the MAVLink Toolchain explains how to install MAVLink on other Ubuntu platforms and Windows, while Generating MAVLink Libraries explains how to build MAVLink for the other programming languages supported by the project. The sub-topics of Using MAVLink Libraries explain how to use the generated libraries. Key Links Documentation/Website (mavlink.io/en/) Discussion/Support Contributing License

Truly universal online file converter Convert to it! Truly universal online file converter. Many online file conversion tools are boring and insecure. They only allow conversion between two formats in the same medium (images to images, videos to videos, etc.), and they require that you upload your files to some server. This is not just terrible for privacy, it's also incredibly lame. What if you really need to convert an AVI video to a PDF document? Try to find an online tool for that, I dare you. Convert.to.it aims to be a tool that "just works". You're almost guaranteed to get an output - perhaps not always the one you expected, but it'll try its best to not leave you hanging. For a semi-technical overview of this tool, check out the video: https://youtu.be/btUbcsTbVA8 Usage Go to convert.to.it Click the big blue box to add your file (or just drag it on to the window). An input format should have been automatically selected. If it wasn't, yikes! Try searching for it, or if it's really not there, see the "Issues" section below. Select an output format from the second list. If you're on desktop, that's the one on the right side. If you're on mobile, it'll be somewhere lower down. Click Convert! Hopefully, after a bit (or a lot) of thinking, the program will spit out the file you wanted. If not, see the "Issues" section below. Issues Ever since the YouTube video released, we've been getting spammed with issues suggesting the addition of all kinds of niche file formats. To keep things organized, I've decided to specify what counts as a valid issue and what doesn't. [!IMPORTANT] SIMPLY ASKING FOR A FILE FORMAT TO BE ADDED IS NOT A MEANINGFUL ISSUE! There are thousands of file formats out there. It can take hours to add support for just one. The math is simple - we can't possibly support every single file. As such, simply listing your favorite file formats is not helpful. We already know that there are formats we don't support, we don't need tickets to tell us that. When suggesting a file format, you must at minimum: Make sure that there isn't already an issue about the same thing, and that we don't already support the format. Explain what you expect the conversion to be like (what medium is it converting to/from). It's important to note here that simply parsing the underlying data is not sufficient. Imagine if we only treated SVG images as raw XML data and didn't support converting them to raster images - that would defeat the point. Provide links to existing browser-based solutions if possible, or at the very least a reference for implementing the format, and make sure the license is compatible with GPL-2.0. If this seems like a lot, please remember - a developer will have to do 100x more work to actually implement the format. Doing a bit of research not only saves them precious time, it also weeds out "unserious" proposals that would only bloat our to-do list. If you're submitting a bug report, you only need to do step 1 - check if the problem isn't already reported by someone else. Bug reports are generally quite important otherwise. Though please note, "converting X to Y doesn't work" is not a bug report. However, "converting X to Y works but not how I expected" likely is a bug report. Deployment Local development (Bun + Vite) Clone this repository WITH SUBMODULES. You can use git clone --recursive https://github.com/p2r3/convert for that. Omitting submodules will leave you missing a few dependencies. Install Bun. Run bun install to install dependencies. Run bunx vite to start the development server. The following steps are optional, but for performance: When you first open the page, it'll take a while to generate the list of supported formats for each tool. If you open the console, you'll see it complaining a bunch about missing caches. After this is done (indicated by a Built initial format list message in the console), use printSupportedFormatCache() to get a JSON string with the cache data. You can then save this string to cache.json to skip that loading screen on startup. Docker (prebuilt image) Docker compose files live in the docker/ directory, so run compose with -f from the repository root: docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d Alternatively download the docker-compose.yml separately and start it by executing docker compose up -d in the same directory. This runs the container on http://localhost:8080/convert/. Docker (local build for development) Use the override file to build the image locally: docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.override.yml up --build -d The first Docker build is expected to be slow because Chromium and related system packages are installed in the build stage (needed for puppeteer in buildCache.js). Later builds are usually much faster due to Docker layer caching. Contributing The best way to contribute is by adding support for new file formats (duh). Here's how that works: Creating a handler Each "tool" used for conversion has to be normalized to a standard form - effectively a "wrapper" that abstracts away the internal processes. These wrappers are available in src/handlers. Below is a super barebones handler that does absolutely nothing. You can use this as a starting point for adding a new format: // file: dummy.ts import type { FileData, FileFormat, FormatHandler } from "../FormatHandler.ts";
import CommonFormats from "src/CommonFormats.ts"; class dummyHandler implements FormatHandler { public name: string = "dummy"; public supportedFormats?: FileFormat[]; public ready: boolean = false; async init () { this.supportedFormats = [ // Example PNG format, with both input and output disabled CommonFormats.PNG.builder("png") .markLossless() // .allowFrom() // .allowTo() ]; this.ready = true; } async doConvert ( inputFiles: FileData[], inputFormat: FileFormat, outputFormat: FileFormat ): Promise { const outputFiles: FileData[] = []; return outputFiles; } } export default dummyHandler; For more details on how all of these components work, refer to the doc in src/FormatHandler.ts. You can also take a look at existing handlers to get a more practical example. There are a few additional things that I want to point out in particular: Pay attention to the naming system. If your tool is called dummy, then the class should be called dummyHandler, and the file should be called dummy.ts. The handler is responsible for setting the output file's name. This is done to allow for flexibility in rare cases where the full file name matters. Of course, in most cases, you'll only have to swap the file extension. The handler is also responsible for ensuring that any byte buffers that enter or exit the handler do not get mutated. If necessary, clone the buffer by wrapping it in new Uint8Array(). When handling MIME types, run them through normalizeMimeType first. One file can have multiple valid MIME types, which isn't great when you're trying to match them algorithmically. When implementing a new file format, please treat the file as the media that it represents, not the data that it contains. For example, if you were making an SVG handler, you should treat the file as an image, not as XML. Adding dependencies If your tool requires an external dependency (which it likely does), there are currently two well-established ways of going about this: If it's an npm package, just install it to the project like you normally would. If it's a Git repository, add it as a submodule to src/handlers. Please try to avoid CDNs (Content Delivery Networks). They're really cool on paper, but they don't work well with TypeScript, and each one introduces a tiny bit of instability. For a project that leans heavily on external dependencies, those bits of instability can add up fast. If you need to load a WebAssembly binary (or similar), add its path to vite.config.js and target it under /convert/wasm/. Do not link to node_modules.

### 29. `EN` [Advanced Prompt Engineering in 2026: Practical Techniques That Actually Improve AI Output](data/articles/8e2eec2df27aeb0c6201c5ccb036e971.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
Prompt engineering in 2026 is no longer about clever phrasing. It’s about building structured, repeatable instruction systems that improve output quality, reduce hallucinations, and make LLM integrations production-ready.
If you’re integrating AI into apps, building automation pipelines, or experimenting with large language models (LLMs), advanced prompt engineering is now a core development skill.
This guide covers practical, developer-focused techniques that actually work.
Why Prompt Engineering Still Matters in 2026
Modern LLMs are more powerful than ever. But power without structure leads to:
Inconsistent outputs
Overly generic responses
Hallucinated assumptions
Formatting chaos
Increased post-processing time
LLMs are probabilistic systems. They don’t “understand” tasks — they predict tokens based on patterns.
Well-designed prompts reduce ambiguity and guide those predictions.
Think of prompts as soft constraints for probabilistic systems.
The Structured Prompt Framework That Works
After testing prompt systems across content automation, SaaS tools, internal AI assistants, and analytics workflows, one framework consistently produces strong results:
Role → Context → Task → Constraints → Output Format
Let’s break it down.
1⃣ Role Assignment (Probability Steering)
Assign a role to influence domain vocabulary and reasoning depth.
Example:
You are a senior DevOps engineer specializing in Kubernetes infrastructure.
Why this works:
Activates relevant token distributions
Reduces surface-level explanations
Encourages domain-specific responses
This is not personality — it’s statistical steering.
2⃣ Context Injection (Reducing Ambiguity)
Weak prompt:
Write an explanation about API security.
Stronger prompt:
Explain API security risks for a Node.js backend serving 50k daily active users in a fintech environment.
Context improves:
Relevance
Specificity
Technical alignment
Garbage context = generic output.
3⃣ Precise Task Definition
Avoid vague verbs like:
Improve
Optimize
Fix
Enhance
Instead, define measurable outcomes:
Write a 700-word technical article for Dev.to explaining how rate limiting works in REST APIs. Include one code example in Express.js.
Specific instructions reduce randomness.
4⃣ Constraint Engineering (Underrated but Powerful)
Constraints dramatically improve quality.
Examples:
Word count range
Required code snippet
Avoid marketing language
No buzzwords
Bullet-point formatting
Target developer audience
Example:
Avoid generic phrases like "in today's fast-paced world."
Negative prompting (telling the model what NOT to do) significantly reduces fluff.
5⃣ Output Format Specification
LLMs perform better when structure is predefined.
Example:
Format:
Short introduction
3 H2 sections
Code example in JavaScript
Final checklist
This reduces manual cleanup and improves automation compatibility.
Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques (2026 Edition)
Now let’s move beyond basics. Few-Shot Prompting (Use Carefully)
Providing 2–4 high-quality examples improves consistency.
Best practice:
Keep examples short
Demonstrate format and tone
Avoid bloated tokens
Too many examples increase cost and reduce clarity. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
For analytical or debugging tasks:
Explain your reasoning step-by-step before giving the final answer.
Improves:
Logical accuracy
Mathematical reasoning
Debug explanations
In production systems, you may hide reasoning from end users but use it internally for reliability. Parameter Tuning Strategy
If you’re using LLM APIs:
Temperature 0–0.3 → Deterministic tasks (documentation, classification)
0.4–0.7 → Balanced outputs
0.8+ → Brainstorming
In production AI features, lower temperature = stability. Prompt Modularization (Pipeline Design)
Instead of one massive prompt, split workflows:
Analysis Prompt
Structuring Prompt
Refinement Prompt
Validation Prompt
This improves:
Reliability
Output consistency
Hallucination reduction
Think like a systems engineer — not a chatbot user.
Common Prompt Engineering Mistakes
Even experienced builders make these errors: Overloading prompts with unnecessary verbosity
LLMs don’t interpret intent.
They predict patterns.
Reduce entropy → improve output.
Production-Level Benefits
Advanced prompt engineering improves:
Output consistency
Automation compatibility
Reduced editing overhead
Faster development cycles
Lower hallucination rates
For AI startups and SaaS platforms, this directly impacts shipping velocity and product reliability.
Final Thoughts: Prompt Engineering Is Systems Design
In 2026, prompt engineering isn’t a trick.
It’s:
Linguistic precision
Context design
Constraint architecture
Workflow engineering
The developers who treat prompting as a structured system — not casual conversation — build more reliable AI-powered tools.
The future isn’t just about integrating AI. It’s about instructing it with precision.

Résultat: les mainteneurs de ces projets open-source, qui vivent de la visibilité générée par les visites et les interactions, voient leur audience s’effondrer. Une étude économique chiffre ce paradoxe: l’IA qui accélère le développement logiciel asphyxie l’écosystème qui le rend possible.

Utilisateur de Canoprof depuis 2019, cet outil est devenu un des piliers de ma pratique d’enseignement en Physique-Chimie (4ᵉ, 5ᵉ, 3ᵉ) et en Sciences (6ᵉ). Je l’utilise pour concevoir l’ensemble de mes supports aussi bien papier que numériques, ce qui me permet de maintenir une cohérence didactique forte sur l’ensemble du cursus collège.
La force de Canoprof réside dans la séparation claire entre le contenu et la forme. En tant qu’enseignant, cela me permet de me concentrer sur le fond pédagogique et la structuration de mes séquences, sans perdre de temps dans les contraintes techniques de mise en page. La richesse de mon fond documentaire, construit depuis plus de six ans, évolue ainsi sereinement au fil des réformes et de mes retours d’expérience.
Canoprof m’aide à formaliser une progression spiralaire efficace tout en générant des supports propres, structurés et accessibles. C’est un gain de productivité précieux qui me permet de consacrer plus d’énergie à l’accompagnement de mes élèves en classe. Guillaume Marmin, enseignant de physique-chimie au Collège Isabelle Autissier.

### 35. `FR` [Rasbperry Pi vs ESP32 : vraies questions, mauvaises comparaisons](data/articles/7729596402dd86a5e4c8d4e5b5113ccc.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Raspberry Pi vs ESP32 vs Arduino, cette question revient régulièrement quand on choisit la bonne plateforme pour son projet IoT. Comme nous le disons souvent quand nous comparons les platesformes, il faut comparer ce qui est comporable. Il ne faut pas opposer une Raspberry Pi 5 avec une ESP32. La Pi est une SBC, une Single Board Computer. Il s'agit donc d'un véritable micro-ordinateur sur une unique carte. Elle contient toute l'électronique (SoC, mémoire, vidéo, audio, stockage, réseau). Et une Pi 5 a besoin d'une alimentation puissante et d'un OS. L'ESP32 repose sur un firmware, qu'il est possible de changer.
L'autre différence est le form factor. La Pi 5 exige de la place et une dissipation thermique active pour les fortes charges.
La Pi 5 fait 8,5 cm sur 4,9 cm contre 5,5 cm sur 2,6 cm pour une ESP32 WROOM-32 (qui n'est pas le modèle le plus petit). L'ESP32 pourrait se comparer à la Pi Pico 2 avec 5,1 cm sur 2,1 cm. Nous ne tenons pas compte de la hauteur des headers.
L'équivalent d'une ESP32 côté Pi est donc la Pi Pico 2, aussi bien par le positionnement, le hardware et le form factor.
Petite comparaison : les specs Pi Pico 2 : un SoC RP235x + cœurs ARM, 520 Ko de SRAM, 4 Mo de stockage, 26 GPIO, UART / SPI / I2C, USB, réseau sans fil selon le modèle. De 6 à 9 € selon le modèle. - ESP32 Wroom32 : SoC ESP32, 512 Ko de RAM, 4 Mo de stockage, 34 GPIO, SPI / I2C / CAN / UART, WiFi + Bluetooth, env. 7-9 € Si vous êtes habitué(e) à coder avec Arduino, vous pouvez sans problème coder depuis l’Arduino IDE, les ESP sont parfaitement supportés. Vous pourrez utiliser peu ou prou les mêmes capteurs. Si vous cherchez une carte réactive avec des interruptions plus rapides, le Pi Pico 2 est souvent considéré comme meilleur. L’ESP32 propose plus de protocoleset de GPIO. Sur la partie connectivité sans fil, les deux cartes supportent le Wi-Fi et le Bluetooth, mais petit avantage à l’ESP32, car le réseau sans fil est une des fonctionnalités intégrées dès la conception. Et le support OTA (mise à jour over the air) peut être un avantage certain dans un contexte contraint ou industriel.
L’ESP32 est plus consommatrice, notamment en charge maximale. La Pi Pico 2 est plus économique. Si vous cherchez avant tout la basse consommation, la Pi sera sans doute la meilleure option.
Sur le modèle de développement, nous avons toujours apprécié la diversité de l’ESP32. Si vous voulez faire du MicroPython, vous devrez flasher le bon firmware. Catégorie actualité: Hardware Raspberry pi, ESP32 Image actualité AMP:

### 37. `FR` [Physiocab : un logiciel libre de gestion pour kinésithérapeutes](data/articles/e0eab329ba8752732324b8914ae82b51.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Physiocab est un logiciel libre de gestion de cabinet de kinésithérapie, développé sous licence Affero GPL 3.0 et hébergé sur Codeberg. Le projet est porté par la société Allium SAS, dans le cadre de la plateforme communautaire Kalinka, dédiée aux kinésithérapeutes francophones.
Le projet vient de passer en beta publique (v0.9) et cherche des testeurs et contributeurs.
Pourquoi un logiciel libre pour les kinés ? Le secteur de la santé libérale souffre d'une offre logicielle dominée par des solutions propriétaires onéreuses, souvent opaques sur le traitement des données de santé. Physiocab propose une alternative : un code auditable, des données stockées localement sous la responsabilité du praticien. lien nᵒ 1 : La page de présentation du projet
lien nᵒ 2 : Le dépôt codeberg
lien nᵒ 3 : PeerJs (MIT) Fonctionnalités
La beta couvre déjà un large périmètre fonctionnel :
Planning hebdomadaire en drag &amp; drop, avec export PDF et gestion des semaines exceptionnelles, particulièrement orienté vers les kinés intervenant en multi-établissements.
Bilans Diagnostiques Kinésithérapiques (BDK) avec tests standardisés (TUG, Tinetti, Handgrip, EVA, évaluation du risque de chute…), export de PDF et historique comparatif.
Suivi des séances avec de multiples exercices structurés (équilibre, force, endurance, mobilisation), chronométrage automatique et calcul de progression.
Application tablette en PWA : fonctionne hors connexion grâce à un Service Worker, s'installe sans passer par un store, interface optimisée tactile.
Stack technique
Backend : Python 3.10+
L'application est multi-plateforme côté client (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). La communication entre l'appli de bureau et l'appli PWA se fait de manière directe via PeerJs. Cette méthode ne nécessite pas de préparation contraignante comme l'ouverture de ports.
Les données sont stockées localement, ce qui implique que le praticien reste maître de ses sauvegardes et de sa conformité RGPD.
Le logiciel a été testé par un kinésithérapeute en situation réelle plusieurs jours d'affilée.
Modèle économique
L'utilisation est gratuite, sans limite dans le temps et sans frais cachés, la licence Affero GPL 3.0 en étant la garantie. Un support payant sur devis est proposé pour les praticiens souhaitant une installation assistée, une formation à distance, des développements sur mesure ou un audit de sécurité.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Nos confrères de Java Code Geeks ont publié un intéressant dossier sur le multiplateforme en 2026 en s'appuyant sur Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), Flutter et React Native. Faire du multiplateforme avec une base de codes et un minimum d'adaptation reste un objectif pour de nombreux développeurs. Si la philosophie de KMP, Flutter et React Native est différente, l'idée est la même : compiler nativement le code logique le plus agnostique possible et créer une interface native pour chaque plateforme. Flutter est un peu différent car il a l'ambition d'adresser toute la stack et de générer l'UI avec son propre moteur pour plus de cohérence. React Native s'appuie sur les composants UI natifs.
Selon les benchmarks de Java Code Geeks, React Native serait le plus lent à démarrer, KMP étant légèrement devant. Sur la taille des binaires, il n'y a pas de réel vainqueur. Par contre, sur la mémoire, React Native et Flutter sont assez gourmands. Sur les animations, KMP et Flutter s'en sortent le mieux. React Native reste aussi en retrait sur l'intégration à la plateforme : nous restons dans un modèle JavaScript avec un risque d'overhead, même si la New Architecture améliore les choses. Quelle est la solution la plus utilisée ? Flutter serait 1er, React Native baisse régulièrement depuis 2023 et KMP connaît une forte progression.
Apprentissage : KMP : langage connu, Kotlin, avec les mêmes outils. Pour le développeur iOS, il faut apprendre Kotlin/Native et l’interopérabilité. KMP est peut-être la solution la moins mature. Flutter : l'inconvénient est d'apprendre Dart et la logique de la plateforme. React Native : si vous connaissez JavaScript, vous connaissez (ou presque) React Native. L'arrivée de la New Architecture oblige à migrer et à apprendre une nouvelle stack. Pour la réalité du code commun et du développement spécifique, tout le monde prétend faire 90 à 95 % de code partagé. Cette promesse est plus ou moins tenue sur le code logique et une UI simple et partagée. Par contre, pour l'intégration plus profonde, par exemple avec les capteurs et le matériel (caméra typiquement), on tombe vite sur du code spécifique. Aucune solution n'est la meilleure. Flutter et React Native incitent à avoir le maximum de code commun, mais cela peut rapidement provoquer des problèmes quand il faut intégrer des fonctions spécifiques à chaque plateforme.
Côté compétence, c'est autre chose. Un développeur JavaScript pourra relativement rapidement faire du React Native. Pour Flutter, il faut spécifiquement apprendre Dart. KMP repose sur le langage Kotlin et une plateforme dédiée qu'il faut maîtriser. Pour un développeur iOS, ce sera sans doute plus long que pour un développeur Kotlin. choisir ? Tout dépend des compétences disponibles et du projet. Flutter permettra de prototyper rapidement un projet, KMP fournit une intégration native et des performances de haut niveau. React Native est sans doute le plus facile à démarrer avec un profil JavaScript si vous souhaitez aller vite dans le développement.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Une des nouveautés les plus importantes est l'intégration Soft Navigations. L'équipe Chrome présente ainsi cette appelleration : a soft navigation est quand JavaScript intercepte une navigation (clic sur un lien) et met à jour le contenu dans la page existente, plutôt que de charger une nouvelle page et que l'URL se mette à jour dans la barre d'adresse. Pour l'utilisateur, cela change peu de choses. Dans Chrome 145, les Soft navigations sont visibles sur le panneau Performance et dans la vue des traces si le site est une SPA. Un timer plus précis
Après l'enregistrement d'une trace dans le panneau Performances, le panneau Sources affiche les temps d'exécution observés ligne par ligne. Vous pouvez ainsi identifier précisément les lignes de code qui consomment le plus de temps.Auparavant, cette fonctionnalité présentait des bogues qui la rendaient peu fiable lorsque le code source était formaté (à l'aide du bouton {}) ou lors de l'utilisation de scripts avec mappage de sources. Le panneau réseau inclut maintenant une colonne dédiée Render blocking. Cela permet de voir les ressources qui bloquent le bon affichage. Autre amélioration : un meilleur debug pour @starting-style.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) vient de publier une mise à jour substantielle de sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre. L’agence confirme que le logiciel libre et la transparence sont essentiels à la sécurité des systèmes d’information. Elle assume sa contribution au libre et la publication de logiciels sous licence libre.
Cette posture très favorable au logiciel libre et open source est une belle avancée et un signal fort. Jusque-là, la posture de l’ANSSI était beaucoup plus floue et sa contribution à des projets libres et open source pouvait même apparaitre en contradiction avec sa doctrine. J’avais l’impression que les collaborateurs de l’ANSSI qui le faisaient reprenaient à leur compte le dicton « Pour vivre heureux, vivons cachés ».
La politique de l’agence est désormais claire : l’ANSSI contribue, l’ANSSI publie, l’ANSSI a une stratégie pragmatique qui peut l’amener à s’engager ou non sur le long terme en fonction de la finalité de l’outil et des motivations de l’ANSSI.
Détail qui a son importance, l’ANSSI indique privilégier, sauf exception justifiée, la licence Apache v2.0 pour les projets qu’elle publie. Je suis ravi de voir ce service privilégier une licence mondialement connue à une licence franco-française ou européenne (elles ont le don de doucher nombre de velléités d’utilisation et de contribution). lien nᵒ 1 : L’ANSSI met à jour sa politique open source (9 février 2026)

Après Rennes en 2024, puis un Barcamp à Perpignan en 2025, cette année 2026 nous emmène au pied des montagnes à Grenoble pour un format de 3 jours de rencontres, soit deux journées de conférences les jeudi et vendredi. La journée du samedi est réservée à la contribution.
Des moments d’ateliers et micro-formation sont également au programme, pour faire de cet évènement une réussite d’un point de vue communauté autour du projet Open Source Drupal.
Le Drupalcamp Grenoble c’est la rencontre de la communauté francophone autour du logiciel libre Drupal. Ouvert à toutes et tous, les rencontres, conférences et ateliers permettent d’adresser à un public toujours plus large des sujets et thématiques diversifiées.
Notre objectif principal est de rendre la création de sites plus simple et la gestion des contenus plus intuitive pour tous. Comme de fédérer les utilisateurs et professionnels qui utilisent Drupal au quotidien.
Du simple curieux au développeur expert, tous ceux qui s’intéressent à Drupal et aux logiciels libres pourront participer à cette manifestation rythmée par :
des conférences (jeudi 9 et vendredi 10 avril), données par des professionnels reconnus et des membres de la communauté Drupal au cours desquels des thématiques nouvelles seront explorées,
des sessions de découverte étayées par des démonstrations à l’intention d’un public plus néophyte,
une journée de formation gratuite (Drupal in a Day) dédiée à l’initiation pour que les curieux puissent se lancer dans la création de leur premier site (sur inscription)
des moments de réseautage et de convivialité avec, notamment, la très attendue soirée communautaire !

### 48. `EN` [Types of Operators in C](data/articles/9611e690ebaa6454275b9873962a6969.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
Introduction
Hello everyone!
In the previous lesson, we understood what an operator is.
We learned that: An operator is a symbol that performs operations on data.
Now the next question is: How many types of operators are there in C... Step 1: Classification of Operators in C
C language provides several types of operators. They are mainly classified into:
1⃣ Arithmetic Operators
Each category performs a specific type of task... Step 2: Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations.
They include:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Modulus (%)
These operators are used in calculations such as... Step 3: Relational Operators
Relational operators compare two values.
They return either true or false.
They include:
== (Equal to)
!= (Not equal to)
(Greater than)
&lt; (Less than)
= (Greater than or equal to)... Step 4: Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.
They include:
&amp;&amp; (Logical AND)
|| (Logical OR)
! (Logical NOT)
For example: Step 5: Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
Basic assignment operator:
Example:
Compound assignment operators:
+=
-=
*=
/=
%=
These operators shorten the code an... Step 6: Increment and Decrement Operators
These operators increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1.
++ (Increment)
-- (Decrement)
They are commonly used in:
Loops
Counters
Iteration processes
They make counting operat... Step 7: Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators operate directly on binary values (bits).
They include:
&amp; (Bitwise AND)
| (Bitwise OR)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
~ (Bitwise NOT)
&lt;&lt; (Left Shift)
(Right Shift)
These are mostly used in... Step 8: Conditional (Ternary) Operator
The conditional operator is written as:
? :
It is a short form of if-else.
Structure:
It makes programs shorter and more... Step 9: Special Operators
C also provides some special operators such as:
sizeof (returns size of data type)
Comma operator
Pointer operators (* and &amp;)
Member access operators (., -&gt;)
These operators are used in advanced... Summary
In this chapter, we learned that C language has different types of operators:
Arithmetic → For calculations
Relational → For comparisons
Logical → For combining conditions
Assignment → For assigning values
Increment/Decrement → For increasing or decreasing...

### 50. `FR` [Python Environnements Extension : pour unifier les environnements Python sur Visual Studio Code](data/articles/0391e1744355c8f298076bf20a13eb17.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Pour simplifier et unifier l'environnement de développement Python sur Visual Studio Code, on dispose de la nouvelle extension Python Environnements. Il doit unifier le modèle de développement, gérer les environnements et les workflows, gérer les interpréteurs et les packages. Jusqu'é présent, l'expérience Python était fragmenté à travers les différents outils (venv, conda, pyenv, etc.). Après plus d'un an d'ajustements et de développement, l'extension est disponible. A terme, tous les flux Python migreront vers l'extension Environnements. Il est possible d'activer dès maintenant : python.useEnvsExtension. L'extension fonctionne en parallèle de l'extension Python et aucune configuration particulière n'est requise : vous ouvrez un fichier Python et l'environnement utilisé est automatiquement détecté. Les environnements supportés sont : venv
conda
pyenv
poetry
pipenv
System Python installs La découverte est assurée par PET (Python Environment Tool), un outil de scan codé en Rust. Si vous utilisez uv, l'extension va automatiquement créer un environnement venv et installer les paquets nécessaires. Pour le moment, il n'est pas possible de créer rapidement des projets sur tous les environnements, seuls venv et conda sont supportés. Sans doute que les autres le seront dans les prochaines versions. Mauvaise nouvelle : l'extension fonctionne UNIQUEMENT sur Windows x64 et Windows ARM et l'édition Web ! Il faut Python soit installé.
Pour le moment, les retours sont plutôt mauvais : extension difficile à utiliser, perte de temps pour créer les environnements depuis Pylance, etc. Et les mises à jour se succèdent. Heureusement que l'extension est officiellement en preview.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Comcast, Classiq et AMD mènent des tests pour améliorer le trafic Internet en utilisant des algorithmes quantiques pour renforcer la résistance du routage réseau. "L’essai conjoint s’est concentré sur un défi clé de la conception des réseaux : identifier des chemins de secours indépendants pour les nœuds du réseau lors des opérations de maintenance ou de modifications. L’objectif était de garantir que, si un site est mis hors ligne et que soudainement, un deuxième tombe en panne, le trafic puisse être redirigé sans interruption ni dégradation du service pour les clients. Pour y parvenir, les opérateurs doivent identifier des chemins de secours distincts, rapides et capables de résister à des pannes simultanées, tout en minimisant la latence. Cette tâche devient de plus en plus complexe à mesure que le réseau s’étend." explique l'annonce. Le schéma présente le design et l'implémentation du flux et de l'algo quantique sur la plateforme Classiq. L’expérimentation a combiné des techniques de calcul quantique et des méthodes classiques haute performance afin d’évaluer la capacité des algorithmes quantiques à identifier, en temps réel, des chemins de secours dans des scénarios de gestion des changements. Elle a été menée à la fois sur du matériel quantique et dans des environnements de simulation accélérés utilisant des GPU AMD Instinct, afin d’atteindre une capacité de calcul (à l’échelle des qubits) encore hors de portée du matériel quantique seul.
« L’avenir du calcul repose sur la convergence entre le classique et le quantique », explique Madhu Rangarajan, vice-président corporate en charge des produits Compute et Enterprise AI chez AMD. « En tant qu’acteur du calcul haute performance, nous cherchons à comprendre nos technologies peuvent accompagner l’émergence du quantique. Cette collaboration montre un cas concret où la simulation accélérée et l’exécution quantique sont combinées pour répondre à un enjeu opérationnel réel dans les réseaux. »

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
concilier agents IA et sites web et la manière dont les pages web pourraient interagir, travailler avec les agents ? WebMCP veut fournir une méthode standard pour définir les actions des agents sur un site web, sur une page web sans pénaliser au bon fonctionnement du site web. "Vous indiquez aux agents et où interagir avec votre site, qu'il s'agisse de réserver un vol, de soumettre une demande d'assistance ou de naviguer dans des données complexes. Ce canal de communication direct élimine toute ambiguïté et permet des flux de travail plus rapides et plus efficaces pour les agents." expliquer Google. WebMCP preview repose sur 2 API :
- API déclarative : Permet d’effectuer des actions standard définies directement dans les formulaires HTML. - API impérative : Permet d’effectuer des interactions plus complexes et dynamiques nécessitant l’exécution de JavaScript. C'est une interface proposé en preview par Google et accessible dans Chrome. Ces API forment un "pont" rendant votre site web "agent ready" et permet de créer des flux agentiques que se veulent plus fiables qu'en passant par du DOM. Ces API sont JavaScript. Pour le moment, la spécification est en cours de rédaction. Elle ne dépend pas de W3C et n'est pas un standard du consortium.

### 58. `FR` [.Net 11 Preview 1 : nouvelles librairies, peu de changements dans C#](data/articles/37ed40d4ebc110a4614a0e84996bc9bd.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
.Net 10 a été distribuée en novembre 2025. La version 11 est désormais disponible en preview 1. Comme à chaque fois, de nombreuses évolutions sont attendues. L'ensemble des frameworks et des langages sont concernées : C#, F#, ASP.Net Core, Blazor, MAUI, le compilateur Jit, le support de CoreCLR dans WebAssembly, meilleure compression / décompression avec Zstandard. Sur la partie librairie, retenons déjà les évolutions suivantes :
- Zstandard est natif à .Net pour la compression. La librairie promet une nette amélioration des performances :
// Compress data using ZstandardStream
using var compressStream = new ZstandardStream(outputStream, CompressionMode.Compress);
await inputStream.CopyToAsync(compressStream); // Decompress data
using var decompressStream = new ZstandardStream(inputStream, CompressionMode.Decompress);
await decompressStream.CopyToAsync(outputStream);
- BFloat16 intègre par défaut toutes les interfaces standards pour le numérique
- amélioration de TimeZone
Note de version sur les librairies : https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/11.0/preview/preview1/libraries.md
Sur la partie runtime, il faut s'attendre à de bonnes nouvelles :
- Runtime async : une nouvelle fonction majeure du runtime et méthodes asynchrones pour améliorer les performances. CoreCLR supporte RuntimeAsync par défaut, idem pour Native AOT
- CoreCLR est supporté dans WebAssembly. Il n'est pas encore disponible en preview 1.
- diverses améliorations de performances sur le JIT - meilleur support de RISC-V
Sur C#, pour le moment, peu de nouveautés annoncées. Deux nouvelles fonctions sont attendues : arguments pour les expresssions Collection et support Extended layout. .Net 11 n'introduira aucune nouvelle fonctionnalité pour Visual Basic. Sur ASP.Net Core et Blazor, les développeurs vont avoir beaucoup de nouveautés : EnvironmentBoundary, nouveau composant Label dans les formulaires Blazor, nouveau composant DisplayName, navigation relative Uri, support "propre" des éléments MathML dans un rendu interactif. Tous les détails dans la note de version : https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/11.0/preview/preview1/aspnetcore.md
La génération de source XAML est par défaut pour les applications .Net MAUI, cela doit permettre un build plus rapide et un debug plus performant. Sur Android, CoreCLR devient le runtime par défaut. Sur Container Images et Winfows Forms, pas de nouveautés annoncées.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
En février, il y a la corvée commerciale de la Saint-Valentin et les réjouissances intellectuelles consécutives à la sortie d’une nouvelle version de la suite bureautique LibreOffice. C’est, bien évidemment, sur LibreOffice 26.2 que l’on va se pencher. Au menu, du très visible, comme les boites de dialogues, du très attendu comme la prise en compte du Markdown ou du moins visible comme le travail sur l’accessibilité.
Il va de soi que les notes de version sont plus exhaustives et qu’il ne s’agit ici que d’une sélection. lien nᵒ 1 : Notes de version Sommaire
L’accessibilité
Support du Markdown
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Writer
Calc
En vrac
Pour finir
Avant de commencer : toutes les captures d’écran ont été faites, volontairement, sur une interface très personnalisée.
L’accessibilité
L’accessibilité de la suite bureautique est un important chantier pour lequel une personne a été recrutée en 2023 (en). Cette version-ci a fait l’objet d’améliorations sensibles. Parallèlement, Sophie Gautier, coordinatrice de The Document Foundation1 (Foundation coordinator) est en train de monter un groupe de travail qui a pour objectif la publication d’un rapport de conformité en matière d’accessibilité pour répondre à la norme européenne EN 301 549 (en) d’accessiblité numérique. La langue de travail de ce groupe est l’anglais.
Concernant les améliorations de cette version :
la boite de dialogue « Vérifier les mises à jour », Aide &gt; Vérifier les mises à jour… est devenue accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
les fonctions d’accessibilité des aperçus des bordures, onglet « Bordures » des boites de dialogue, ont été revues afin qu’elles ne perturbent plus les dispositifs d’assistance ;
sur Linux : la boite de dialogue Outils&gt; Orthographe est annoncée correctement par le lecteur d’écran ;
quand on supprimait la sélection accessible, le curseur se déplaçait automatiquement au début du texte, ce comportement perturbant est supprimé ;
dans Writer, les fautes d’orthographe ne sont plus signalées par les dispositifs d’assistance si la vérification orthographique n’est pas activée ;
l’accessibilité au clavier de la boite de dialogue des extensions : Outils &gt; Extensions est accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
et enfin, il est possible de naviguer entre les onglets verticaux avec des raccourcis clavier.
Support du Markdown
Le Markdown est devenu le format de balisage léger standard « de fait ». Et c’est celui supporté par LinuxFR. Son support a été introduit dans cette version, c’est un des formats d’enregistrement qui s’est ajouté à la série des autres formats de la suite, pas un format d’export. Pour l’utiliser pour vos sites, passant pour LinuxFR, vous devrez :
soit ouvrir le fichier .md dans un éditeur de texte, n’importe lequel, même Mousepad fait l’affaire par exemple, et copier-coller ensuite le tout à partir de l’éditeur de texte là où vous le voulez ;
soit, si cela est possible, importer le fichier .md dans ce qui vous sert pour gérer le site comme le fait par exemple l’extension ODT2SPIP pour le système de gestion de contenu SPIP qui permet de créer une nouvelle page dans SPIP avec un fichier.ODT. ça marche avec LinuxFR ? Plutôt bien. Les styles de caractère Accentuation (ici en italiques) et Accentuation forte (ici gras) sont bien reconnu ainsi que Texte source pour « télétype », les indications in-texte encadrées de l’accent grave U+0060. Les styles de paragraphes :
Bloc de citation (paragraphes de citation précédés d’une ligne blanche et du signe « &gt; » dans la saisie de contenu sur LinuxFR) ;
Contenu de tableau ;
Corps de texte ;
Liste, par contre la numérotation des listes ordonnée ne semble pas bien fonctionner, il faut saisir les numéros à la main ;
Texte préformaté pour écrire des blocs de code ;
Titre 1, Titre 2, Titre 3 et Titre de tableau.
Les tableaux sont bien repris ainsi que les liens insérés via l’insertion d’hyperliens.
Ce qui ne semble pas fonctionner du tout : ce sont les notes, elles disparaissent corps et biens. C’est peut-être dû au passage dans l’éditeur de texte qui transforme un peu le document. Et, évidemment, il faut rajouter les images avec la syntaxe LinuxFR.
La version de Mardown de LibreOffice est CommonMark (en) et la bibliothèque utilisée est MD4C avec quelques extensions prises en charge par cette bibliothèque (cf ce rapport de bug (en) et ses réponses), pour en savoir plus, voir cette note (en) du blog de The Document Foundation.
Petite remarque, si vous utilisez un LibreOffice 25.8, vous avez peut-être pu constater qu’il était question d’enregistrement au format .md, cette information a été ajoutée trop précocement car la version 25.8 ne gère pas le Markdown.
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Les boites de dialogue, notamment de styles et de formats, ont beaucoup changé. Longtemps elles se sont affichées avec une présentation par onglets en haut et le contenu dessous.
Puis il y a une période de transition en 2025 qui a fait grincer une collection complète de dents où on avait, selon l’endroit où on était, soit des onglets soit une navigation par menu latéral. Cette dernière avait un gros défaut : par exemple pour la configuration des styles dans Writer il fallait descendre tout en bas pour accéder aux options qui étaient cachées. Et il n’y avait pas de barre de défilement pour aller plus vite.
LibreOffice 26.2 voit ces défauts corrigés : les boites de dialogue sont harmonisées dans toute la suite et leur menu latéral, toujours sans barre de défilement qui s’avère finalement inutile, montre clairement tous les types de paramètres auxquels on peut accéder. Et, comme on peut le voir, LibreOffice a intégré une meilleure prise en charge des systèmes d’écritures asiatiques et complexes en affichant deux colonnes, une pour les polices occidentales, ou pour les polices asiatiques ou complexes. Une personne a également été recrutée en 2023 (en) pour travailler sur le support des systèmes d’écriture de droite à gauche (RTL) et complexes (CTL). Si toutefois, vous préférez revenir à l’affichage avec les onglets, il suffit d’aller dans le menu Outils &gt; Options &gt; Apparenceau niveau de « Boites de dialogue » et cocher l’option Horizontal en haut. Il faut savoir que les onglets en haut ne s’affichent que sur une seule ligne et qu’il faudra donc naviguer avec les flèches quand il y a de nombreuses options. Writer
Il y a un certain nombre d’amélioration autour de la compatibilité avec le format DOCX : séparation de tableaux flottants en plusieurs tableaux, suppression de la numérotation des notes de bas de page à l’ouverture d’un fichier DOCX, etc.
On relèvera deux nouvelles options d’alignement des paragraphes : « Début » et « Fin ». Si vous utilisez l’alphabet latin, vous ne verrez aucune différence avec les deux options « Forcer à gauche/en haut » et « Forcer à droite/en bas ». Elles ont été développées pour réutiliser plus facilement les styles entre les divers systèmes d’écriture. Pour continuer sur la lancée du travail pour la prise en compte des systèmes d’écriture dont le fonctionnement est différent de celui de l’alphabet latin, il est possible de changer la direction du texte : de gauche à droite ou de droite à gauche en cours de travail. Cela peut se paramétrer dans les styles. Calc
Un gros travail sur les performances a été fait : vitesse de défilement, rapidité des classeurs avec de nombreuses formes et du rejet des modifications. On voit apparaître de nouvelles options de tri (Données &gt;Trier) qui dépendent de la « locale » (langue définie dans les Options de LibreOffice). On peut ainsi déterminer quel caractère est utilisé comme séparateur de décimal pour le tri naturel. On peut relever aussi une avancée ergonomique qui va plaire à toutes celles et ceux qui utilisent les matrices, on peut maintenant modifier les formules matricielles avec la combinaison de touches : F2 + ↑ Maj + Ctrl + Entrée, il n’est plus nécessaire de modifier la formule elle-même.
Et aussi : si vous utilisez (pourquoi diable ?) le format d’enregistrement XLSX, c’est le format EXCEL2010+ qui est le format par défaut, il change de nom pour devenir « Classeur Excel 2010-365 ».2
En vrac
Base est devenu complètement multi-utilisateur, TDF a, d’ailleurs, recruté une personne pour travailler sur l’application.

JSON, pour JavaScript Object Notation, est un format standard utilisé pour représenter des données structurées. Il est utilisé notamment pour échanger les informations entre un navigateur et un serveur. C’est, par exemple, le format de sauvegarde des marques-pages de Firefox ou de certains fichiers d’archives de Mastodon. Les documents XML et JSON génériques avec des plages pouvant être liées sont maintenant automatiquement mappés à des feuilles dans Calc. Une plage pouvant être liée est une section d’un document contenant des enregistrements tabulaires. Lorsqu’un document contient plusieurs plages pouvant être liées, chaque plage est mappée à une seule feuille3.

Pour finir
Cette dépêche a, bien, évidemment, été rédigée avec LibreOffice et, cette fois-ci dans un fichier enregistré en Markdown. Les seules balises que j’ai dû entrer à la main sont celles des images. Kate a l’air de modifier le fichier et, quand je réouvre le .md dans LibreOffice, il y a des styles qui ont sauté mais la mise en forme reste visuellement la même. Kate rajoute aussi des barres obliques devant les « &gt; », aux crochets [ ] et même à certains hyperliens (images). Il y a peut-être des éditeurs de texte plus adaptés ou des réglages à faire.
J’ai rédigé cette dépêche en même temps qu’un article sur LibreOffice 26.2 pour mon site. Si l’article n’est pas vraiment dupliqué, il n’est pas étonnant d’y trouver des morceaux ici. Que tout cela ne nous empêche d’adresser tous nos remerciements à celles et ceux qui font de LibreOffice une suite bureautique si agréable à utiliser et si performante.

The Document Foundation ou TDF est la fondation de droit allemand qui pilote le projet LibreOffice. Il y a deux formats OOXML différents et donc deux formats XLSX différents, la version 2007 et la version actuelle depuis 2010. S’il vous est vraiment nécessaire d’enregistrer au format XLSX, il faut utiliser la version de 2010. Notes de version.

**Source:** Hacker News Show | **Keyword:** `Tech`
I built Orchestera as a PaaS that allows you to orchestrate Apache Spark clusters in your own AWS account, with no additional markup on compute via EC2 instances.
I built this because I was tired of the compute markup that products like AWS EMR and Databricks charge for the convenience of using Apache Spark via their platforms. One can argue that Databricks is a superior product with a lot of additional value in their offering but I don't see that with AWS EMR Apache Spark at all (given my personal experience working with it).
My motivation to build this was to be able to create your own Apache Spark cluster without needing any understanding of the underlying data infrastructure engineering and quickly get to the point of writing Spark pipelines, whether as Python applications or Jupyter notebooks, all with no markup on compute because I don't think that is a justified narrative.
It took me almost an year to build it with a day job and of course I used AI for frontend design and video narrations, the infrastructue engineering that goes behind it comes with quite a bit of experience in the industry. The backend that orchestrates the cluster is written with the following:
- Django and DRF for API
- Temporal for async workers
- Pulumi that is run via Temporal workers to orchestrate the cluster
- Karpenter for node auto-scaling based on Spark executor workloads and requests
- Librechat for Spark History server and MCP based debugging for Spark pipeline run analysis
There are currently no caps on the CPU limits so you can try this out today in your own personal AWS accounts for free.

### 4. `EN` [Show HN: ClawShell, Process-Level Isolation for OpenClaw Credentials](data/articles/0dfbeb9bee919a24623a2d0d37928567.html)
**Source:** Hacker News Show | **Keyword:** `Tech`
Hi HN,
I’ve been using OpenClaw daily since it dropped in November. I love the agency it provides, but as I started giving it more production API keys and access to my local filesystem, I realized the threat model was essentially "hope-based."
We ran an experiment to see how resilient a standard OpenClaw setup was to prompt injection. Within 2 mins, we were able to exfiltrate active session tokens and API credentials through the chat interface.
The problem is fundamental: in most agent architectures, the LLM logic and the sensitive credentials live in the same process space. If the agent is tricked, the attacker has everything.
We built and open-sourced a project called ClawShell to move the security boundary from the "prompt" to the "system runtime."
How it works: ClawShell acts as a privileged protection layer. It isolates sensitive operations into a separate process enforced by the OS. The secrets never enter the agent’s memory or process space. When the agent needs to perform an action, it sends a request to the ClawShell wrapper, which validates the intent and executes the call using the protected keys.
If the agent is hijacked via prompt injection, the attacker gets a scoped identifier that contains zero credentials and no lateral access to the sensitive environment.
Key Technical Details:
* Structural Boundaries: We assume the LLM is untrusted. Isolation is handled at the OS level, not via "system prompts."
* Zero-Trust Tooling: The agent triggers the tool, but the tool execution is handled by a separate, restricted process.
* Compatibility: It’s designed to be a drop-in wrapper for existing OpenClaw instances.
We’re launching v0.1 today. I’m curious to hear how others are thinking about the "Lethal Trifecta" (Data + Action + Communication) in the agent space. Is anyone else looking at Sanboxing for this, or is OS-level isolation the right path? URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47075823

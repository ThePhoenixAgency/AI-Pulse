Apple released macOS Tahoe last September, but despite two point updates since then, it is still struggling to resolve an embarrassing interface issue in Finder that appears to have been introduced with its Liquid Glass redesign.


If you updated your Mac to macOS Tahoe and you prefer to work in Finder's column view, there's a good chance you've been frustrated by the glitch, which developer Jeff Johnson has been admirably tracking over on his blog.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
There's a native YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro that's great for user-uploaded VR180 and 3D 360 content, but 2D video is better watched in Safari or third-party apps.


YouTube has a native app on Apple Vision Pro
When Apple Vision Pro launched in February 2024, there was a host of popular apps missing from it, including YouTube. While many apps still aren't on the platform or native, including Apple's, Google has finally brought its app to the platform.
The app itself is straightforward and functions identically to the YouTube app on iPad.

The newly launched Aqara U400 is the first — and so far only — smart lock with Ultra Wideband Home Key support, and after using it for the past month, I don't think I can go back.


Aqara U400 review: The first UWB smart lock
I firmly believe that smart locks are one of the best smart home devices you can add to your home. Not only do they offer unparalleled convenience of unlocking or locking your home from anywhere, but they also add peace of mind.
If I get in the car to leave my house, I don't have to fret about whether the door was locked.

Meta plans to add a facial recognition feature to its Ray-Ban smart glasses as soon as this year, reports The New York Times ($). 


According to people involved in the plans who spoke to the publication, the feature is internally called "Name Tag," and would let wearers identify people and get information about them via Meta's artificial intelligence assistant. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants the feature to differentiate the devices and to make the AI assistant in the glasses more useful.

News that the improved Siri is delayed don't fully ring true, but tales of Apple Health+ being at least trimmed down do. Plus one in four smartphones is now an iPhone, and Apple Creator Studio continues to have surprises, all on the AppleInsider+ podcast.

Sometimes news can be too bad to be true. While there is a report that all of the key new Siri features have been delayed, it doesn't quite hold water.

Jon Prosser is currently being sued by Apple over his leaks, but continues to publish videos with claims of what is coming next for the iPhone. Most recently, he claimed that the iPhone 18 Pro will move the front-facing camera to the left — although sources say he misread a translation and this isn't happening.

Well it only took two years, but there’s finally an official YouTube app for Vision Pro. You could always just visit YouTube using the Vision Pro web browser, but that’s not the same thing. And the popular third-party app, Juno, was quickly taken down.
The official YouTube app is not quite an MVP (minimum viable product), but it’s close. It’s just a floating window that can play YouTube videos, including the relatively paltry selection of 3D 360-degree and VR 180-degree videos.

When it comes to Apple executives, Sabih Khan is probably one of the lesser-known personalities. While CEO Tim Cook is famous, as are other managerial members like Craig Federighi and predecessor Jeff Williams, Khan has been less prominent in the company so far.

Coding is one of the skills I’ve been eyeing on and off for a few years now. When Apple first launched the Swift Playgrounds app on the iPad, I instantly fell in love with the concept and enrolled in multiple online courses to learn iOS app development. While I quickly absorbed the basics of coding in Swift, mastering the skill to ship functional iPhone apps turned out to be a real challenge. That changed when Apple released its latest Xcode update.
Xcode version 26.3 introduces native support for AI coding agents, such as OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Agent.

TL;DR: Track wallets, IDs, and badges with these ultra-slim Apple Find My-compatible SmartCards — grab a 4-pack for just $59.97 (MSRP $99.96).
Traveling has a funny way of exposing which everyday items you really can’t afford to lose. For instance, certain luggage, wallets, purses, and your backpack essentials.
That’s exactly why the ultra-slim KeySmart SmartCard Lite exists. Unlike bulky trackers, these are built to live inside your wallet, badge holder, or ID sleeve without adding noticeable bulk — they’re thinner than two credit cards and under 2mm thick.

The patent troll Optis has been told by a US jury that Apple has not infringed on any of its LTE patents, ending the elongated dispute in the US until yet another appeal is made.


Optis hoped to collect money for every iPhone sold
The latest jury trial occurred after the US Court of Appeals threw out a verdict that would have had Apple paying Optis $300 million in damages. The case was then sent to a trial by jury where the jury members would be asked a single question about the five patents.
According to a report from Reuters, the jury voted unanimously. The question was:

Apple did not infringe on any patents owned by Texas-based company Optis Wireless, a jury ruled today. In a verdict shared by Reuters, the jury decided that Apple did not infringe any of the five LTE patents that Optis sued over back in 2019. If Optis had won, Apple could have faced hundreds of millions in damages.


Optis Wireless initially won $506 million from Apple in a 2020 jury trial, but the damages were thrown out after Apple appealed because the jury didn't calculate damages with an understanding of fair and reasonable essential patent (FRAND) terms.

Apple is still planning to launch the smarter, more capable version of Siri in 2026, the company told CNBC today. Apple's statement comes just a day after Bloomberg reported Apple is having issues with the updated version of ‌Siri‌, leading to potential delays of the feature.


Apple initially intended to launch the Apple Intelligence-powered version of ‌Siri‌ in spring 2025, but right around when a debut was expected in March 2025, Apple said that Siri wasn't ready and needed more time. Later in the year, Apple said that it would launch its Siri update in 2026.

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman yesterday reported that Apple’s new Siri initiative was facing internal delays, having originally been planned to start rolling out with iOS 26.4. Gurman suggested features may start appearing in iOS 26.5, or later releases in the year.
That report has seemingly rocked investor confidence, with Apple stock plummeting today. Seemingly in response, CNBC’s Steve Kovach says Apple confirmed to him that it remains on track to launch new Siri this year, which is essentially reaffirming what it has promised publicly all along.

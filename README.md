Expert's Rating



Pros
Simple to use on all platforms
Big focus on privacy and transparency
105 countries
Cons
Pricing changes offer tiered services at the cost of flexible contract lengths
Our Verdict 
ExpressVPN is fast and simple to get to grips with, offering a great way to get around geoblocking at a reasonable price. While the Mac app is a little basic, that’s arguably part of its charm – you open it, click, and go, but you will miss out on additional features like antivirus tools offered by some rivals.

Pros
Compact 3-in-1 charger
25W iPhone charging
Apple Watch fast charger
Charge as stand or flat
Cheaper than X40 Turbo
Cons
Small but bigger than X40 Turbo
Our Verdict 
This more affordable variant of the metal X40 Turbo is rated at the same super-fast charging speeds for iPhone, AirPods and Watch. While maybe not as pocketable it’s just as portable, and the choice between the two Kuxiu chargers may just come down to color choice.

Nearly one in four active smartphones worldwide are now iPhones, according to new data from Counterpoint Research.


The findings from Counterpoint's Smartphone Installed Base Tracker show that the global installed base of active smartphones grew 2% in 2025, driven primarily by lengthening replacement cycles and the continued circulation of second-life devices. Unlike shipment figures, which measure yearly sales, installed base data reflects the total number of devices currently in use, making it a key indicator of long-term platform choices.

When it comes to smartphone launches, the principle of “no news is good news” rarely applies: a new phone that’s largely the same as its predecessor can only be a disappointment. But one exception, particularly at times of economic turmoil, is the price tag.

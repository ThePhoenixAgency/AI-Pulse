## Mac & Apple

### 1. [Best Mac monitors 2026: The Mac compatible displays we recommend](https://www.macworld.com/article/668700/best-mac-monitors-displays.html)
**Source:** MacWorld | **Tags:** `Mac` `Reviews` `Guides`

The monitor might be the second-most important part of your Mac’s setup after the Mac, of course–after all, you can’t use any desktop computer without one and even the 16-inch screen on the MacBook Pro is going to feel cramped if you are having a particularly productive morning. Spread your work out by plugging in multiple monitors to your Mac and extending your desktop over a wider space.
Because you’ll spend a lot of time looking at the display, you’ll want to invest wisely.

### 2. [Pay for MS Office once and use it forever on your Mac (+ save 77%)](https://www.macworld.com/article/3051506/pay-for-ms-office-once-and-use-it-forever-on-your-mac-save-77.html)

TL;DR: This is Microsoft Office for Mac the old-school way: one $50 payment (MSRP $219), lifetime access, no monthly fees.
There are two kinds of Mac users: those who live inside Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—and those who quietly resent paying a monthly fee just to keep using them. If you’re in the second group, this deal is for you.
Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2021 for Mac delivers the classic Office experience with a one-time purchase instead of an ongoing subscription.

TL;DR: Pick up an iPad 11 on sale for only $370 (reg. $499).
The global RAM shortage is causing tech prices to rise across the board, but refurbished prices are still staying low. This 2025 iPad 11 is in near-mint condition, but because it’s technically a refurb, it only costs $369.99 instead of $499.
This iPad 11 has an A16 chip with a 5-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, so it can handle multitasking, 4K video editing, and everyday apps without feeling slow.

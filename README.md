### 1. `EN` [Railway secures $100 million to challenge AWS with AI-native cloud infrastructure](data/articles/e670024b9a32e878ab282337aaddf6f9.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Railway, a San Francisco-based cloud platform that has quietly amassed two million developers without spending a dollar on marketing, announced Thursday that it raised $100 million in a Series B funding round, as surging demand for artificial intelligence applications exposes the limitations of legacy cloud infrastructure.
TQ Ventures led the round, with participation from FPV Ventures, Redpoint, and Unusual Ventures. The investment values Railway as one of the most significant infrastructure startups to emerge during the AI boom, capitalizing on developer frustration with the complexity and cost of traditional platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.
"As AI models get better at writing code, more and more people are asking the age-old question: where, and how, do I run my applications?" said Jake Cooper, Railway's 28-year-old founder and chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. "The last generation of cloud primitives were slow and outdated, and now with AI moving everything faster, teams simply can't keep up."
The funding is a dramatic acceleration for a company that has charted an unconventional path through the cloud computing industry. Railway raised just $24 million in total before this round, including a $20 million Series A from Redpoint in 2022. The company now processes more than 10 million deployments monthly and handles over one trillion requests through its edge network — metrics that rival far larger and better-funded competitors.
Why three-minute deploy times have become unacceptable in the age of AI coding assistants
Railway's pitch rests on a simple observation: the tools developers use to deploy and manage software were designed for a slower era. A standard build-and-deploy cycle using Terraform, the industry-standard infrastructure tool, takes two to three minutes. That delay, once tolerable, has become a critical bottleneck as AI coding assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor can generate working code in seconds.
"When godly intelligence is on tap and can solve any problem in three seconds, those amalgamations of systems become bottlenecks," Cooper told VentureBeat. "What was really cool for humans to deploy in 10 seconds or less is now table stakes for agents."
The company claims its platform delivers deployments in under one second — fast enough to keep pace with AI-generated code. Customers report a tenfold increase in developer velocity and up to 65 percent cost savings compared to traditional cloud providers.
These numbers come directly from enterprise clients, not internal benchmarks. Daniel Lobaton, chief technology officer at G2X, a platform serving 100,000 federal contractors, measured deployment speed improvements of seven times faster and an 87 percent cost reduction after migrating to Railway. His infrastructure bill dropped from $15,000 per month to approximately $1,000.
"The work that used to take me a week on our previous infrastructure, I can do in Railway in like a day," Lobaton said. "If I want to spin up a new service and test different architectures, it would take so long on our old setup. In Railway I can launch six services in two minutes."
Inside the controversial decision to abandon Google Cloud and build data centers from scratch
What distinguishes Railway from competitors like Render and Fly.io is the depth of its vertical integration. In 2024, the company made the unusual decision to abandon Google Cloud entirely and build its own data centers, a move that echoes the famous Alan Kay maxim: "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware."
"We wanted to design hardware in a way where we could build a differentiated experience," Cooper said. "Having full control over the network, compute, and storage layers lets us do really fast build and deploy loops, the kind that allows us to move at 'agentic speed' while staying 100 percent the smoothest ride in town."
The approach paid dividends during recent widespread outages that affected major cloud providers — Railway remained online throughout.
This soup-to-nuts control enables pricing that undercuts the hyperscalers by roughly 50 percent and newer cloud startups by three to four times. Railway charges by the second for actual compute usage: $0.00000386 per gigabyte-second of memory, $0.00000772 per vCPU-second, and $0.00000006 per gigabyte-second of storage. There are no charges for idle virtual machines — a stark contrast to the traditional cloud model where customers pay for provisioned capacity whether they use it or not.
"The conventional wisdom is that the big guys have economies of scale to offer better pricing," Cooper noted. "But when they're charging for VMs that usually sit idle in the cloud, and we've purpose-built everything to fit much more density on these machines, you have a big opportunity."
How 30 employees built a platform generating tens of millions in annual revenue
Railway has achieved its scale with a team of just 30 employees generating tens of millions in annual revenue — a ratio of revenue per employee that would be exceptional even for established software companies. The company grew revenue 3.5 times last year and continues to expand at 15 percent month-over-month.
Cooper emphasized that the fundraise was strategic rather than necessary. "We're default alive; there's no reason for us to raise money," he said. "We raised because we see a massive opportunity to accelerate, not because we needed to survive."
The company hired its first salesperson only last year and employs just two solutions engineers. Nearly all of Railway's two million users discovered the platform through word of mouth — developers telling other developers about a tool that actually works.
"We basically did the standard engineering thing: if you build it, they will come," Cooper recalled. "And to some degree, they came."
From side projects to Fortune 500 deployments: Railway's unlikely corporate expansion
Despite its grassroots developer community, Railway has made significant inroads into large organizations. The company claims that 31 percent of Fortune 500 companies now use its platform, though deployments range from company-wide infrastructure to individual team projects.
Notable customers include Bilt, the loyalty program company; Intuit's GoCo subsidiary; TripAdvisor's Cruise Critic; and MGM Resorts. Kernel, a Y Combinator-backed startup providing AI infrastructure to over 1,000 companies, runs its entire customer-facing system on Railway for $444 per month.
"At my previous company Clever, which sold for $500 million, I had six full-time engineers just managing AWS," said Rafael Garcia, Kernel's chief technology officer. "Now I have six engineers total, and they all focus on product. Railway is exactly the tool I wish I had in 2012."
For enterprise customers, Railway offers security certifications including SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and HIPAA readiness, with business associate agreements available upon request. The platform provides single sign-on authentication, comprehensive audit logs, and the option to deploy within a customer's existing cloud environment through a "bring your own cloud" configuration.
Enterprise pricing starts at custom levels, with specific add-ons for extended log retention ($200 monthly), HIPAA BAAs ($1,000), enterprise support with SLOs ($2,000), and dedicated virtual machines ($10,000).
The startup's bold strategy to take on Amazon, Google, and a new generation of cloud rivals
Railway enters a crowded market that includes not only the hyperscale cloud providers—Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform—but also a growing cohort of developer-focused platforms like Vercel, Render, Fly.io, and Heroku.
Cooper argues that Railway's competitors fall into two camps, neither of which has fully committed to the new infrastructure model that AI demands.
"The hyperscalers have two competing systems, and they haven't gone all-in on the new model because their legacy revenue stream is still printing money," he observed. "They have this mammoth pool of cash coming from people who provision a VM, use maybe 10 percent of it, and still pay for the whole thing. To what end are they actually interested in going all the way in on a new experience if they don't really need to?"
Against startup competitors, Railway differentiates by covering the full infrastructure stack. "We're not just containers; we've got VM primitives, stateful storage, virtual private networking, automated load balancing," Cooper said. "And we wrap all of this in an absurdly easy-to-use UI, with agentic primitives so agents can move 1,000 times faster."
The platform supports databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis; provides up to 256 terabytes of persistent storage with over 100,000 input/output operations per second; and enables deployment to four global regions spanning the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Enterprise customers can scale to 112 vCPUs and 2 terabytes of RAM per service.
Why investors are betting that AI will create a thousand times more software than exists today
Railway's fundraise reflects broader investor enthusiasm for companies positioned to benefit from the AI coding revolution. As tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude become standard fixtures in developer workflows, the volume of code being written — and the infrastructure needed to run it — is expanding dramatically.
"The amount of software that's going to come online over the next five years is unfathomable compared to what existed before — we're talking a thousand times more software," Cooper predicted. "All of that has to run somewhere."
The company has already integrated directly with AI systems, building what Cooper calls "loops where Claude can hook in, call deployments, and analyze infrastructure automatically." Railway released a Model Context Protocol server in August 2025 that allows AI coding agents to deploy applications and manage infrastructure directly from code editors.
"The notion of a developer is melting before our eyes," Cooper said. "You don't have to be an engineer to engineer things anymore — you just need critical thinking and the ability to analyze things in a systems capacity."
What Railway plans to do with $100 million and zero marketing experience
Railway plans to use the new capital to expand its global data center footprint, grow its team beyond 30 employees, and build what Cooper described as a proper go-to-market operation for the first time in the company's five-year history.
"One of my mentors said you raise money when you can change the trajectory of the business," Cooper explained. "We've built all the required substrate to scale indefinitely; what's been holding us back is simply talking about it. 2026 is the year we play on the world stage."
The company's investor roster reads like a who's who of developer infrastructure. Angel investors include Tom Preston-Werner, co-founder of GitHub; Guillermo Rauch, chief executive of Vercel; Spencer Kimball, chief executive of Cockroach Labs; Olivier Pomel, chief executive of Datadog; and Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear.
The timing of Railway's expansion coincides with what many in Silicon Valley view as a fundamental shift in how software gets made. Coding assistants are no longer experimental curiosities — they have become essential tools that millions of developers rely on daily. Each line of AI-generated code needs somewhere to run, and the incumbents, by Cooper's telling, are too wedded to their existing business models to fully capitalize on the moment.
Whether Railway can translate developer enthusiasm into sustained enterprise adoption remains an open question. The cloud infrastructure market is littered with promising startups that failed to break the grip of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. But Cooper, who previously worked as a software engineer at Wolfram Alpha, Bloomberg, and Uber before founding Railway in 2020, seems unfazed by the scale of his ambition.
"In five years, Railway [will be] the place where software gets created and evolved, period," he said. "Deploy instantly, scale infinitely, with zero friction. That's the prize worth playing for, and there's no bigger one on offer."
For a company that built a $100 million business by doing the opposite of what conventional startup wisdom dictates — no marketing, no sales team, no venture hype—the real test begins now. Railway spent five years proving that developers would find a better mousetrap on their own. The next five will determine whether the rest of the world is ready to get on board.

### 2. `EN` [Claude Code costs up to $200 a month. Goose does the same thing for free.](data/articles/1bd5d5f60cc30b30eee498627c185f8f.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
The artificial intelligence coding revolution comes with a catch: it's expensive.
Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-based AI agent that can write, debug, and deploy code autonomously, has captured the imagination of software developers worldwide. But its pricing — ranging from $20 to $200 per month depending on usage — has sparked a growing rebellion among the very programmers it aims to serve.
Now, a free alternative is gaining traction. Goose, an open-source AI agent developed by Block (the financial technology company formerly known as Square), offers nearly identical functionality to Claude Code but runs entirely on a user's local machine. No subscription fees. No cloud dependency. No rate limits that reset every five hours.
"Your data stays with you, period," said Parth Sareen, a software engineer who demonstrated the tool during a recent livestream. The captures the core appeal: Goose gives developers complete control over their AI-powered workflow, including the ability to work offline — even on an airplane.
The project has exploded in popularity. Goose now boasts more than 26,100 stars on GitHub, the code-sharing platform, with 362 contributors and 102 releases since its launch. The latest version, 1.20.1, shipped on January 19, 2026, reflecting a development pace that rivals commercial products.
For developers frustrated by Claude Code's pricing structure and usage caps, Goose represents something increasingly rare in the AI industry: a genuinely free, no-strings-attached option for serious work. Anthropic's new rate limits spark a developer revolt
To understand why Goose matters, you need to understand the Claude Code pricing controversy.
Anthropic, the San Francisco artificial intelligence company founded by former OpenAI executives, offers Claude Code as part of its subscription tiers. The free plan provides no access whatsoever. The Pro plan, at $17 per month with annual billing (or $20 monthly), limits users to just 10 to 40 prompts every five hours — a constraint that serious developers exhaust within minutes of intensive work.
The Max plans, at $100 and $200 per month, offer more headroom: 50 to 200 prompts and 200 to 800 prompts respectively, plus access to Anthropic's most powerful model, Claude 4.5 Opus. But even these premium tiers come with restrictions that have inflamed the developer community.
In late July, Anthropic announced new weekly rate limits. Under the system, Pro users receive 40 to 80 hours of Sonnet 4 usage per week. Max users at the $200 tier get 240 to 480 hours of Sonnet 4, plus 24 to 40 hours of Opus 4. Nearly five months later, the frustration has not subsided.
The problem? Those "hours" are not actual hours. They represent token-based limits that vary wildly depending on codebase size, conversation length, and the complexity of the code being processed. Independent analysis suggests the actual per-session limits translate to roughly 44,000 tokens for Pro users and 220,000 tokens for the $200 Max plan.
"It's confusing and vague," one developer wrote in a widely shared analysis. "When they say '24-40 hours of Opus 4,' that doesn't really tell you anything useful about what you're actually getting."
The backlash on Reddit and developer forums has been fierce. Some users report hitting their daily limits within 30 minutes of intensive coding. Others have canceled their subscriptions entirely, calling the new restrictions "a joke" and "unusable for real work."
Anthropic has defended the changes, stating that the limits affect fewer than five percent of users and target people running Claude Code "continuously in the background, 24/7." But the company has not clarified whether that figure refers to five percent of Max subscribers or five percent of all users — a distinction that matters enormously.
How Block built a free AI coding agent that works offline
Goose takes a radically different approach to the same problem.
Built by Block, the payments company led by Jack Dorsey, Goose is what engineers call an "on-machine AI agent." Unlike Claude Code, which sends your queries to Anthropic's servers for processing, Goose can run entirely on your local computer using open-source language models that you download and control yourself.
The project's documentation describes it as going "beyond code suggestions" to "install, execute, edit, and test with any LLM." That last phrase — "any LLM" — is the key differentiator. Goose is model-agnostic by design.
You can connect Goose to Anthropic's Claude models if you have API access. You can use OpenAI's GPT-5 or Google's Gemini. You can route it through services like Groq or OpenRouter. Or — and this is where things get interesting — you can run it entirely locally using tools like Ollama, which let you download and execute open-source models on your own hardware.
The practical implications are significant. With a local setup, there are no subscription fees, no usage caps, no rate limits, and no concerns about your code being sent to external servers. Your conversations with the AI never leave your machine.
"I use Ollama all the time on planes — it's a lot of fun!" Sareen noted during a demonstration, highlighting how local models free developers from the constraints of internet connectivity.
What Goose can do that traditional code assistants can't
Goose operates as a command-line tool or desktop application that can autonomously perform complex development tasks. It can build entire projects from scratch, write and execute code, debug failures, orchestrate workflows across multiple files, and interact with external APIs — all without constant human oversight.
The architecture relies on what the AI industry calls "tool calling" or "function calling" — the ability for a language model to request specific actions from external systems. When you ask Goose to create a new file, run a test suite, or check the status of a GitHub pull request, it doesn't just generate text describing what should happen. It actually executes those operations.
This capability depends heavily on the underlying language model. Claude 4 models from Anthropic currently perform best at tool calling, according to the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard, which ranks models on their ability to translate natural language requests into executable code and system commands.
But newer open-source models are catching up quickly. Goose's documentation highlights several options with strong tool-calling support: Meta's Llama series, Alibaba's Qwen models, Google's Gemma variants, and DeepSeek's reasoning-focused architectures.
The tool also integrates with the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, an emerging standard for connecting AI agents to external services. Through MCP, Goose can access databases, search engines, file systems, and third-party APIs — extending its capabilities far beyond what the base language model provides.
Setting Up Goose with a Local Model
For developers interested in a completely free, privacy-preserving setup, the process involves three main components: Goose itself, Ollama (a tool for running open-source models locally), and a compatible language model.
Step 1: Install Ollama
Ollama is an open-source project that dramatically simplifies the process of running large language models on personal hardware. It handles the complex work of downloading, optimizing, and serving models through a simple interface.
Download and install Ollama from ollama.com. Once installed, you can pull models with a single command. For coding tasks, Qwen 2.5 offers strong tool-calling support:
ollama run qwen2.5
The model downloads automatically and begins running on your machine.
Step 2: Install Goose
Goose is available as both a desktop application and a command-line interface. The desktop version provides a more visual experience, while the CLI appeals to developers who prefer working entirely in the terminal.
Installation instructions vary by operating system but generally involve downloading from Goose's GitHub releases page or using a package manager. Block provides pre-built binaries for macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux.
Step 3: Configure the Connection
In Goose Desktop, navigate to Settings, then Configure Provider, and select Ollama. Confirm that the API Host is set to http://localhost:11434 (Ollama's default port) and click Submit.
For the command-line version, run goose configure, select "Configure Providers," choose Ollama, and enter the model name when prompted.
That's it. Goose is now connected to a language model running entirely on your hardware, ready to execute complex coding tasks without any subscription fees or external dependencies.
The RAM, processing power, and trade-offs you should know about
The obvious question: what kind of computer do you need?
Running large language models locally requires substantially more computational resources than typical software. The key constraint is memory — specifically, RAM on most systems, or VRAM if using a dedicated graphics card for acceleration.
Block's documentation suggests that 32 gigabytes of RAM provides "a solid baseline for larger models and outputs." For Mac users, this means the computer's unified memory is the primary bottleneck. For Windows and Linux users with discrete NVIDIA graphics cards, GPU memory (VRAM) matters more for acceleration.
But you don't necessarily need expensive hardware to get started. Smaller models with fewer parameters run on much more modest systems. Qwen 2.5, for instance, comes in multiple sizes, and the smaller variants can operate effectively on machines with 16 gigabytes of RAM.
"You don't need to run the largest models to get excellent results," Sareen emphasized. The practical recommendation: start with a smaller model to test your workflow, then scale up as needed.
For context, Apple's entry-level MacBook Air with 8 gigabytes of RAM would struggle with most capable coding models. But a MacBook Pro with 32 gigabytes — increasingly common among professional developers — handles them comfortably.
Why keeping your code off the cloud matters more than ever
Goose with a local LLM is not a perfect substitute for Claude Code. The comparison involves real trade-offs that developers should understand.
Model Quality: Claude 4.5 Opus, Anthropic's flagship model, remains arguably the most capable AI for software engineering tasks. It excels at understanding complex codebases, following nuanced instructions, and producing high-quality code on the first attempt. Open-source models have improved dramatically, but a gap persists — particularly for the most challenging tasks.
One developer who switched to the $200 Claude Code plan described the difference bluntly: "When I say 'make this look modern,' Opus knows what I mean. Other models give me Bootstrap circa 2015."
Context Window: Claude Sonnet 4.5, accessible through the API, offers a massive one-million-token context window — enough to load entire large codebases without chunking or context management issues. Most local models are limited to 4,096 or 8,192 tokens by default, though many can be configured for longer contexts at the cost of increased memory usage and slower processing.
Speed: Cloud-based services like Claude Code run on dedicated server hardware optimized for AI inference. Local models, running on consumer laptops, typically process requests more slowly. The difference matters for iterative workflows where you're making rapid changes and waiting for AI feedback.
Tooling Maturity: Claude Code benefits from Anthropic's dedicated engineering resources. Features like prompt caching (which can reduce costs by up to 90 percent for repeated contexts) and structured outputs are polished and well-documented. Goose, while actively developed with 102 releases to date, relies on community contributions and may lack equivalent refinement in specific areas.
How Goose stacks up against Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and the paid AI coding market
Goose enters a crowded market of AI coding tools, but occupies a distinctive position.
Cursor, a popular AI-enhanced code editor, charges $20 per month for its Pro tier and $200 for Ultra—pricing that mirrors Claude Code's Max plans. Cursor provides approximately 4,500 Sonnet 4 requests per month at the Ultra level, a substantially different allocation model than Claude Code's hourly resets.
Cline, Roo Code, and similar open-source projects offer AI coding assistance but with varying levels of autonomy and tool integration. Many focus on code completion rather than the agentic task execution that defines Goose and Claude Code.
Amazon's CodeWhisperer, GitHub Copilot, and enterprise offerings from major cloud providers target large organizations with complex procurement processes and dedicated budgets. They are less relevant to individual developers and small teams seeking lightweight, flexible tools.
Goose's combination of genuine autonomy, model agnosticism, local operation, and zero cost creates a unique value proposition. The tool is not trying to compete with commercial offerings on polish or model quality. It's competing on freedom — both financial and architectural.
The $200-a-month era for AI coding tools may be ending

### 3. `EN` [Nous Research's NousCoder-14B is an open-source coding model landing right in the Claude Code moment](data/articles/b37d936464575171be4586234d600b41.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Nous Research, the open-source artificial intelligence startup backed by crypto venture firm Paradigm, released a new competitive programming model on Monday that it says matches or exceeds several larger proprietary systems — trained in just four days using 48 of Nvidia's latest B200 graphics processors.
The model, called NousCoder-14B, is another entry in a crowded field of AI coding assistants, but arrives at a particularly charged moment: Claude Code, the agentic programming tool from rival Anthropic, has dominated social media discussion since New Year's Day, with developers posting breathless testimonials about its capabilities. The simultaneous developments underscore how quickly AI-assisted software development is evolving — and how fiercely companies large and small are competing to capture what many believe will become a foundational technology for how software gets written.
type: embedded-entry-inline id: 74cSyrq6OUrp9SEQ5zOUSl
NousCoder-14B achieves a 67.87 percent accuracy rate on LiveCodeBench v6, a standardized evaluation that tests models on competitive programming problems published between August 2024 and May 2025. That figure represents a 7.08 percentage point improvement over the base model it was trained from, Alibaba's Qwen3-14B, according to Nous Research's technical report published alongside the release.
"I gave Claude Code a description of the problem, it generated what we built last year in an hour," wrote Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google responsible for the Gemini API, in a viral post on X last week that captured the prevailing mood around AI coding tools. Dogan was describing a distributed agent orchestration system her team had spent a year developing — a system Claude Code approximated from a three-paragraph prompt.
The juxtaposition is instructive: while Anthropic's Claude Code has captured imaginations with demonstrations of end-to-end software development, Nous Research is betting that open-source alternatives trained on verifiable problems can close the gap — and that transparency in how these models are built matters as much as raw capability. How Nous Research built an AI coding model that anyone can replicate
What distinguishes the NousCoder-14B release from many competitor announcements is its radical openness. Nous Research published not just the model weights but the complete reinforcement learning environment, benchmark suite, and training harness — built on the company's Atropos framework — enabling any researcher with sufficient compute to reproduce or extend the work.
"Open-sourcing the Atropos stack provides the necessary infrastructure for reproducible olympiad-level reasoning research," noted one observer on X, summarizing the significance for the academic and open-source communities.
The model was trained by Joe Li, a researcher in residence at Nous Research and a former competitive programmer himself. Li's technical report reveals an unexpectedly personal dimension: he compared the model's improvement trajectory to his own journey on Codeforces, the competitive programming platform where participants earn ratings based on contest performance.
Based on rough estimates mapping LiveCodeBench scores to Codeforces ratings, Li calculated that NousCoder-14B's improvemen t— from approximately the 1600-1750 rating range to 2100-2200 — mirrors a leap that took him nearly two years of sustained practice between ages 14 and 16. The model accomplished the equivalent in four days.
"Watching that final training run unfold was quite a surreal experience," Li wrote in the technical report.
But Li was quick to note an important caveat that speaks to broader questions about AI efficiency: he solved roughly 1,000 problems during those two years, while the model required 24,000. Humans, at least for now, remain dramatically more sample-efficient learners. Inside the reinforcement learning system that trains on 24,000 competitive programming problems
NousCoder-14B's training process offers a window into the increasingly sophisticated techniques researchers use to improve AI reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.
The approach relies on what researchers call "verifiable rewards" — a system where the model generates code solutions, those solutions are executed against test cases, and the model receives a simple binary signal: correct or incorrect. This feedback loop, while conceptually straightforward, requires significant infrastructure to execute at scale.
Nous Research used Modal, a cloud computing platform, to run sandboxed code execution in parallel. Each of the 24,000 training problems contains hundreds of test cases on average, and the system must verify that generated code produces correct outputs within time and memory constraints — 15 seconds and 4 gigabytes, respectively.
The training employed a technique called DAPO (Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization), which the researchers found performed slightly better than alternatives in their experiments. A key innovation involves "dynamic sampling" — discarding training examples where the model either solves all attempts or fails all attempts, since these provide no useful gradient signal for learning.
The researchers also adopted "iterative context extension," first training the model with a 32,000-token context window before expanding to 40,000 tokens. During evaluation, extending the context further to approximately 80,000 tokens produced the best results, with accuracy reaching 67.87 percent.
Perhaps most significantly, the training pipeline overlaps inference and verification — as soon as the model generates a solution, it begins work on the next problem while the previous solution is being checked. This pipelining, combined with asynchronous training where multiple model instances work in parallel, maximizes hardware utilization on expensive GPU clusters. The looming data shortage that could slow AI coding model progress
Buried in Li's technical report is a finding with significant implications for the future of AI development: the training dataset for NousCoder-14B encompasses "a significant portion of all readily available, verifiable competitive programming problems in a standardized dataset format."
In other words, for this particular domain, the researchers are approaching the limits of high-quality training data.
"The total number of competitive programming problems on the Internet is roughly the same order of magnitude," Li wrote, referring to the 24,000 problems used for training. "This suggests that within the competitive programming domain, we have approached the limits of high-quality data."
This observation echoes growing concern across the AI industry about data constraints. While compute continues to scale according to well-understood economic and engineering principles, training data is "increasingly finite," as Li put it.
"It appears that some of the most important research that needs to be done in the future will be in the areas of synthetic data generation and data efficient algorithms and architectures," he concluded.
The challenge is particularly acute for competitive programming because the domain requires problems with known correct solutions that can be verified automatically. Unlike natural language tasks where human evaluation or proxy metrics suffice, code either works or it doesn't — making synthetic data generation considerably more difficult.
Li identified one potential avenue: training models not just to solve problems but to generate solvable problems, enabling a form of self-play similar to techniques that proved successful in game-playing AI systems. "Once synthetic problem generation is solved, self-play becomes a very interesting direction," he wrote. A $65 million bet that open-source AI can compete with Big Tech

**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup, Listen Labs, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million offers seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a billboard in San Francisco displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.
The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.
That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by Ribbit Capital with participation from Evantic and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Conviction, and Pear VC. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews. "When you obsess over customers, everything else follows," Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. "Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is."
Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix it
Listen's AI researcher finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.
Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: "Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can't get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys." The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, "gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they're talking about. And the problem is you can't scale that."
The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.
What distinguishes Listen's approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. "In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options," Wahlforss said. "Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty."
The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraud
Listen finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called "one of the most shocking things that we've learned when we entered this industry"—rampant fraud.
"Essentially, there's a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players," he explained. "We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud."
The company built what it calls a "quality guard" that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: "People talk three times more. They're much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health."
Emeritus, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. "We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information," said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.
How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better products
The speed advantage has proven central to Listen's pitch. Traditional customer research at Microsoft could take four to six weeks to generate insights. "By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it," said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.
With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.
The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. "We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward," Patel said, "and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day." Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.
Simple Modern, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. "We went from 'Should we even have this product?' to 'How should we launch it?'" said Chris Hoyle, the company's Chief Marketing Officer.
Chubbies, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. "There's school, sports, dinner, and homework," explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. "I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules."
The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI "through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed." The redesigned product became "a blockbuster hit."
The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not less
Listen Labs is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly $140 billion annually, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption.
"There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing," Wahlforss said. "Why we're replacing them is that one, they're super costly. Two, they're kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with."
But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn't just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption.
"What I've noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don't need less of it. You want more of it," Wahlforss explained. "There's infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren't researchers before can now do that as part of their job."
Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toilet
Listen Labs traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. "We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day," Wahlforss recalled. "We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today."
The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss's co-founder "was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot." The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the International Olympiad in Informatics — the same competition that produced the founders of Cognition, the AI coding startup.
The Berghain billboard stunt generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.
"We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet," he said. "But now we fixed that situation."
The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.
Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building next
Wahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building "the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we've done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices."
Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. "Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?"
Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. "Obviously, as you said, there's kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop."
The company already handles sensitive data with care. "We don't train on any of the data," Wahlforss said. "We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that."
How AI could reshape the future of product development
Perhaps the most provocative implication of Listen's model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop.
"They're based in Australia, so they're coding during the day, and then in their night, they're releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate."
The vision extends Y Combinator's famous dictum — "write code, talk to users" — into an automated cycle. "Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you'll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously."
Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen's control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A 2024 MIT study found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos.
"I'm constantly have to emphasize like, let's make sure the quality is there and the details are right," he said.
But the company's growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft's Patel said Listen has "removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work." Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day.
"It's a total game changer," said Ali Romero, Sling Money's marketing manager.
Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he's building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website.
One of them: "Slow is fake."
It's an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution. But Listen Labs is betting that in the AI era, the companies that listen fastest will be the ones that win. The only question is whether customers will talk back.

### 5. `EN` [Salesforce rolls out new Slackbot AI agent as it battles Microsoft and Google in workplace AI](data/articles/db7ff708ed2fd3ffb22714bc4e846e1c.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Salesforce on Tuesday launched an entirely rebuilt version of Slackbot, the company's workplace assistant, transforming it from a simple notification tool into what executives describe as a fully powered AI agent capable of searching enterprise data, drafting documents, and taking action on behalf of employees.
The new Slackbot, now generally available to Business+ and Enterprise+ customers, is Salesforce's most aggressive move yet to position Slack at the center of the emerging "agentic AI" movement — where software agents work alongside humans to complete complex tasks. The launch comes as Salesforce attempts to convince investors that artificial intelligence will bolster its products rather than render them obsolete.
"Slackbot isn't just another copilot or AI assistant," said Parker Harris, Salesforce co-founder and Slack's chief technology officer, in an exclusive interview with Salesforce. "It's the front door to the agentic enterprise, powered by Salesforce."
From tricycle to Porsche: Salesforce rebuilt Slackbot from the ground up
Harris was blunt about what distinguishes the new Slackbot from its predecessor: "The old Slackbot was, you know, a little tricycle, and the new Slackbot is like, you know, a Porsche."
The original Slackbot, which has existed since Slack's early days, performed basic algorithmic tasks — reminding users to add colleagues to documents, suggesting channel archives, and delivering simple notifications. The new version runs on an entirely different architecture built around a large language model and sophisticated search capabilities that can access Salesforce records, Google Drive files, calendar data, and years of Slack conversations.
"It's two different things," Harris explained. "The old Slackbot was algorithmic and fairly simple. The new Slackbot is brand new — it's based around an LLM and a very robust search engine, and connections to third-party search engines, third-party enterprise data."
Salesforce chose to retain the Slackbot brand despite the fundamental technical overhaul. "People know what Slackbot is, and so we wanted to carry that forward," Harris said.
Why Anthropic's Claude powers the new Slackbot — and which AI models could come next
The new Slackbot runs on Claude, Anthropic's large language model, a choice driven partly by compliance requirements. Slack's commercial service operates under FedRAMP Moderate certification to serve U.S. federal government customers, and Harris said Anthropic was "the only provider that could give us a compliant LLM" when Slack began building the new system.
But that exclusivity won't last. "We are, this year, going to support additional providers," Harris said. "We have a great relationship with Google. Gemini is incredible — performance is great, cost is great. So we're going to use Gemini for some things." He added that OpenAI remains a possibility as well.
Harris echoed Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's view that large language models are becoming commoditized: "You've heard Marc talk about LLMs are commodities, that they're democratized. I call them CPUs."
On the sensitive question of training data, Harris was unequivocal: Salesforce does not train any models on customer data. "Models don't have any sort of security," he explained. "If we trained it on some confidential conversation that you and I have, I don't want Carolyn to know — if I train it into the LLM, there is no way for me to say you get to see the answer, but Carolyn doesn't."
Inside Salesforce's internal experiment: 80,000 employees tested Slackbot with striking results
Salesforce has been testing the new Slackbot internally for months, rolling it out to all 80,000 employees. According to Ryan Gavin, Slack's chief marketing officer, the results have been striking: "It's the fastest adopted product in Salesforce history."
Internal data shows that two-thirds of Salesforce employees have tried the new Slackbot, with 80% of those users continuing to use it regularly. Internal satisfaction rates reached 96% — the highest for any AI feature Slack has shipped. Employees report saving between two and 20 hours per week.
The adoption happened largely organically. "I think it was about five days, and a Canvas was developed by our employees called 'The Most Stealable Slackbot Prompts,'" Gavin said. "People just started adding to it organically. I think it's up to 250-plus prompts that are in this Canvas right now."
Kate Crotty, a principal UX researcher at Salesforce, found that 73% of internal adoption was driven by social sharing rather than top-down mandates. "Everybody is there to help each other learn and communicate hacks," she said.
How Slackbot transforms scattered enterprise data into executive-ready insights
During a product demonstration, Amy Bauer, Slack's product experience designer, showed how Slackbot can synthesize information across multiple sources. In one example, she asked Slackbot to analyze customer feedback from a pilot program, upload an image of a usage dashboard, and have Slackbot correlate the qualitative and quantitative data.
"This is where Slackbot really earns its keep for me," Bauer explained. "What it's doing is not just simply reading the image — it's actually looking at the image and comparing it to the insight it just generated for me."
Slackbot can then query Salesforce to find enterprise accounts with open deals that might be good candidates for early access, creating what Bauer called "a really great justification and plan to move forward." Finally, it can synthesize all that information into a Canvas — Slack's collaborative document format — and find calendar availability among stakeholders to schedule a review meeting.
"Up until this point, we have been working in a one-to-one capacity with Slackbot," Bauer said. "But one of the benefits that I can do now is take this insight and have it generate this into a Canvas, a shared workspace where I can iterate on it, refine it with Slackbot, or share it out with my team."
Rob Seaman, Slack's chief product officer, said the Canvas creation demonstrates where the product is heading: "This is making a tool call internally to Slack Canvas to actually write, effectively, a shared document. But it signals where we're going with Slackbot — we're eventually going to be adding in additional third-party tool calls."
MrBeast's company became a Slackbot guinea pig—and employees say they're saving 90 minutes a day
Among Salesforce's pilot customers is Beast Industries, the parent company of YouTube star MrBeast. Luis Madrigal, the company's chief information officer, joined the launch announcement to describe his experience.
"As somebody who has rolled out enterprise technologies for over two decades now, this was practically one of the easiest," Madrigal said. "The plumbing is there. Slack as an implementation, Enterprise Tools — being able to turn on the Slackbot and the Slack AI functionality was as simple as having my team go in, review, do a quick security review."
Madrigal said his security team signed off "rather quickly" — unusual for enterprise AI deployments — because Slackbot accesses only the information each individual user already has permission to view. "Given all the guardrails you guys have put into place for Slackbot to be unique and customized to only the information that each individual user has, only the conversations and the Slack rooms and Slack channels that they're part of—that made my security team sign off rather quickly."
One Beast Industries employee, Sinan, the head of Beast Games marketing, reported saving "at bare minimum, 90 minutes a day." Another employee, Spencer, a creative supervisor, described it as "an assistant who's paying attention when I'm not."
Other pilot customers include Slalom, reMarkable, Xero, Mercari, and Engine. Mollie Bodensteiner, SVP of Operations at Engine, called Slackbot "an absolute 'chaos tamer' for our team," estimating it saves her about 30 minutes daily "just by eliminating context switching."

### 6. `EN` [Anthropic launches Cowork, a Claude Desktop agent that works in your files — no coding required](data/articles/a102a18a5efc083299a9baaa1b4a8378.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
Anthropic released Cowork on Monday, a new AI agent capability that extends the power of its wildly successful Claude Code tool to non-technical users — and according to company insiders, the team built the entire feature in approximately a week and a half, largely using Claude Code itself.
The launch marks a major inflection point in the race to deliver practical AI agents to mainstream users, positioning Anthropic to compete not just with OpenAI and Google in conversational AI, but with Microsoft's Copilot in the burgeoning market for AI-powered productivity tools.
"Cowork lets you complete non-technical tasks much like how developers use Claude Code," the company announced via its official Claude account on X. The feature arrives as a research preview available exclusively to Claude Max subscribers — Anthropic's power-user tier priced between $100 and $200 per month — through the macOS desktop application.
For the past year, the industry narrative has focused on large language models that can write poetry or debug code. With Cowork, Anthropic is betting that the real enterprise value lies in an AI that can open a folder, read a messy pile of receipts, and generate a structured expense report without human hand-holding. How developers using a coding tool for vacation research inspired Anthropic's latest product
The genesis of Cowork lies in Anthropic's recent success with the developer community. In late 2024, the company released Claude Code, a terminal-based tool that allowed software engineers to automate rote programming tasks. The tool was a hit, but Anthropic noticed a peculiar trend: users were forcing the coding tool to perform non-coding labor.
According to Boris Cherny, an engineer at Anthropic, the company observed users deploying the developer tool for an unexpectedly diverse array of tasks. "Since we launched Claude Code, we saw people using it for all sorts of non-coding work: doing vacation research, building slide decks, cleaning up your email, cancelling subscriptions, recovering wedding photos from a hard drive, monitoring plant growth, controlling your oven," Cherny wrote on X. "These use cases are diverse and surprising — the reason is that the underlying Claude Agent is the best agent, and Opus 4.5 is the best model."
Recognizing this shadow usage, Anthropic effectively stripped the command-line complexity from their developer tool to create a consumer-friendly interface. In its blog post announcing the feature, Anthropic explained that developers "quickly began using it for almost everything else," which "prompted us to build Cowork: a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude in the very same way."
Inside the folder-based architecture that lets Claude read, edit, and create files on your computer
Unlike a standard chat interface where a user pastes text for analysis, Cowork requires a different level of trust and access. Users designate a specific folder on their local machine that Claude can access. Within that sandbox, the AI agent can read existing files, modify them, or create entirely new ones.
Anthropic offers several illustrative examples: reorganizing a cluttered downloads folder by sorting and intelligently renaming each file, generating a spreadsheet of expenses from a collection of receipt screenshots, or drafting a report from scattered notes across multiple documents.
"In Cowork, you give Claude access to a folder on your computer. Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder," the company explained on X. "Try it to create a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft from scattered notes." The architecture relies on what is known as an "agentic loop." When a user assigns a task, the AI does not merely generate a text response. Instead, it formulates a plan, executes steps in parallel, checks its own work, and asks for clarification if it hits a roadblock. Users can queue multiple tasks and let Claude process them simultaneously — a workflow Anthropic describes as feeling "much less like a back-and-forth and much more like leaving messages for a coworker."
The system is built on Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK, meaning it shares the same underlying architecture as Claude Code. Anthropic notes that Cowork "can take on many of the same tasks that Claude Code can handle, but in a more approachable form for non-coding tasks."
The recursive loop where AI builds AI: Claude Code reportedly wrote much of Claude Cowork
Perhaps the most remarkable detail surrounding Cowork's launch is the speed at which the tool was reportedly built — highlighting a recursive feedback loop where AI tools are being used to build better AI tools.
During a livestream hosted by Dan Shipper, Felix Rieseberg, an Anthropic employee, confirmed that the team built Cowork in approximately a week and a half.
Alex Volkov, who covers AI developments, expressed surprise at the timeline: "Holy shit Anthropic built 'Cowork' in the last... week and a half?!" This prompted immediate speculation about how much of Cowork was itself built by Claude Code. Simon Smith, EVP of Generative AI at Klick Health, put it bluntly on X: "Claude Code wrote all of Claude Cowork. Can we all agree that we're in at least somewhat of a recursive improvement loop here?"
The implication is profound: Anthropic's AI coding agent may have substantially contributed to building its own non-technical sibling product. If true, this is one of the most visible examples yet of AI systems being used to accelerate their own development and expansion — a strategy that could widen the gap between AI labs that successfully deploy their own agents internally and those that do not.
Connectors, browser automation, and skills extend Cowork's reach beyond the local file system
Cowork doesn't operate in isolation. The feature integrates with Anthropic's existing ecosystem of connectors — tools that link Claude to external information sources and services such as Asana, Notion, PayPal, and other supported partners. Users who have configured these connections in the standard Claude interface can leverage them within Cowork sessions.
Additionally, Cowork can pair with Claude in Chrome, Anthropic's browser extension, to execute tasks requiring web access. This combination allows the agent to navigate websites, click buttons, fill forms, and extract information from the internet — all while operating from the desktop application.
"Cowork includes a number of novel UX and safety features that we think make the product really special," Cherny explained, highlighting "a built-in VM [virtual machine] for isolation, out of the box support for browser automation, support for all your claude.ai data connectors, asking you for clarification when it's unsure."
Anthropic has also introduced an initial set of "skills" specifically designed for Cowork that enhance Claude's ability to create documents, presentations, and other files. These build on the Skills for Claude framework the company announced in October, which provides specialized instruction sets Claude can load for particular types of tasks.
Why Anthropic is warning users that its own AI agent could delete their files
The transition from a chatbot that suggests edits to an agent that makes edits introduces significant risk. An AI that can organize files can, theoretically, delete them.
In a notable display of transparency, Anthropic devoted considerable space in its announcement to warning users about Cowork's potential dangers — an unusual approach for a product launch.
The company explicitly acknowledges that Claude "can take potentially destructive actions (such as deleting local files) if it's instructed to." Because Claude might occasionally misinterpret instructions, Anthropic urges users to provide "very clear guidance" about sensitive operations.
More concerning is the risk of prompt injection attacks — a technique where malicious actors embed hidden instructions in content Claude might encounter online, potentially causing the agent to bypass safeguards or take harmful actions.
"We've built sophisticated defenses against prompt injections," Anthropic wrote, "but agent safety — that is, the task of securing Claude's real-world actions — is still an active area of development in the industry."
The company characterized these risks as inherent to the current state of AI agent technology rather than unique to Cowork. "These risks aren't new with Cowork, but it might be the first time you're using a more advanced tool that moves beyond a simple conversation," the announcement notes.
Anthropic's desktop agent strategy sets up a direct challenge to Microsoft Copilot
The launch of Cowork places Anthropic in direct competition with Microsoft, which has spent years attempting to integrate its Copilot AI into the fabric of the Windows operating system with mixed adoption results.
However, Anthropic's approach differs in its isolation. By confining the agent to specific folders and requiring explicit connectors, they are attempting to strike a balance between the utility of an OS-level agent and the security of a sandboxed application.
What distinguishes Anthropic's approach is its bottom-up evolution. Rather than designing an AI assistant and retrofitting agent capabilities, Anthropic built a powerful coding agent first — Claude Code — and is now abstracting its capabilities for broader audiences. This technical lineage may give Cowork more robust agentic behavior from the start.
Claude Code has generated significant enthusiasm among developers since its initial launch as a command-line tool in late 2024. The company expanded access with a web interface in October 2025, followed by a Slack integration in December. Cowork is the next logical step: bringing the same agentic architecture to users who may never touch a terminal.
Who can access Cowork now, and what's coming next for Windows and other platforms
For now, Cowork remains exclusive to Claude Max subscribers using the macOS desktop application. Users on other subscription tiers — Free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise — can join a waitlist for future access.
Anthropic has signaled clear intentions to expand the feature's reach. The blog post explicitly mentions plans to add cross-device sync and bring Cowork to Windows as the company learns from the research preview.
Cherny set expectations appropriately, describing the product as "early and raw, similar to what Claude Code felt like when it first launched."
To access Cowork, Max subscribers can download or update the Claude macOS app and click on "Cowork" in the sidebar.
The real question facing enterprise AI adoption
For technical decision-makers, the implications of Cowork extend beyond any single product launch. The bottleneck for AI adoption is shifting — no longer is model intelligence the limiting factor, but rather workflow integration and user trust.
Anthropic's goal, as the company puts it, is to make working with Claude feel less like operating a tool and more like delegating to a colleague. Whether mainstream users are ready to hand over folder access to an AI that might misinterpret their instructions remains an open question.
But the speed of Cowork's development — a major feature built in ten days, possibly by the company's own AI — previews a future where the capabilities of these systems compound faster than organizations can evaluate them. The chatbot has learned to use a file manager. What it learns to use next is anyone's guess.

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles Intel and Hugging Face collaborated to demonstrate the real-world value of upgrading to Google’s latest C4 Virtual Machine (VM) running on Intel Xeon 6 processors (codenamed Granite Rapids (GNR)). We specifically wanted to benchmark improvements in the text generation performance of OpenAI GPT OSS Large Language Model(LLM). The results are in, and they are impressive, demonstrating a 1.7x improvement in Total Cost of Ownership(TCO) over the previous-generation Google C3 VM instances. The Google Cloud C4 VM instance further resulted in: 1.4x to 1.7x TPOT throughput/vCPU/dollar
Lower price per hour over C3 VM Introduction GPT OSS is a common name for an open-source Mixture of Experts (MoE) model released by OpenAI. An MoE model is a deep neural network architecture that uses specialized “expert” sub-networks and a “gating network” to decide which experts to use for a given input. MoE models allow you to scale your model capacity efficiently without linearly scaling compute costs. They also allow for specialization, where different “experts” learn different skills, allowing them to adapt to diverse data distributions.
Even with very large parameters, only a small subset of experts is activated per token, making CPU inference viable.

### 20. `EN` [The creator of Claude Code just revealed his workflow, and developers are losing their minds](data/articles/c2e433d6dc0060138f55b9de14c8a605.html)
**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Keyword:** `AI`
When the creator of the world's most advanced coding agent speaks, Silicon Valley doesn't just listen — it takes notes.
For the past week, the engineering community has been dissecting a thread on X from Boris Cherny, the creator and head of Claude Code at Anthropic. What began as a casual sharing of his personal terminal setup has spiraled into a viral manifesto on the future of software development, with industry insiders calling it a watershed moment for the startup. "If you're not reading the Claude Code best practices straight from its creator, you're behind as a programmer," wrote Jeff Tang, a prominent voice in the developer community. Kyle McNease, another industry observer, went further, declaring that with Cherny's "game-changing updates," Anthropic is "on fire," potentially facing "their ChatGPT moment."
The excitement stems from a paradox: Cherny's workflow is surprisingly simple, yet it allows a single human to operate with the output capacity of a small engineering department. As one user noted on X after implementing Cherny's setup, the experience "feels more like Starcraft" than traditional coding — a shift from typing syntax to commanding autonomous units.
Here is an analysis of the workflow that is reshaping how software gets built, straight from the architect himself. How running five AI agents at once turns coding into a real-time strategy game
The most striking revelation from Cherny's disclosure is that he does not code in a linear fashion. In the traditional "inner loop" of development, a programmer writes a function, tests it, and moves to the next. Cherny, however, acts as a fleet commander.
"I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal," Cherny wrote. "I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input."
By utilizing iTerm2 system notifications, Cherny effectively manages five simultaneous work streams. While one agent runs a test suite, another refactors a legacy module, and a third drafts documentation. He also runs "5-10 Claudes on claude.ai" in his browser, using a "teleport" command to hand off sessions between the web and his local machine.
This validates the "do more with less" strategy articulated by Anthropic President Daniela Amodei earlier this week. While competitors like OpenAI pursue trillion-dollar infrastructure build-outs, Anthropic is proving that superior orchestration of existing models can yield exponential productivity gains.
The counterintuitive case for choosing the slowest, smartest model
In a surprising move for an industry obsessed with latency, Cherny revealed that he exclusively uses Anthropic's heaviest, slowest model: Opus 4.5.
"I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything," Cherny explained. "It's the best coding model I've ever used, and even though it's bigger &amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it's better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end."
For enterprise technology leaders, this is a critical insight. The bottleneck in modern AI development isn't the generation speed of the token; it is the human time spent correcting the AI's mistakes. Cherny's workflow suggests that paying the "compute tax" for a smarter model upfront eliminates the "correction tax" later.
One shared file turns every AI mistake into a permanent lesson
Cherny also detailed how his team solves the problem of AI amnesia. Standard large language models do not "remember" a company's specific coding style or architectural decisions from one session to the next.
To address this, Cherny's team maintains a single file named CLAUDE.md in their git repository. "Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time," he wrote.

Back to Articles What Is OpenEnv? The Calendar Gym: A Production-Grade Benchmark What We Learned Looking Ahead Appendix: Common error cases in tool use Specific error cases found in the wild AI agents often perform impressively in controlled research settings, yet struggle when deployed in real-world systems where they must reason across multiple steps, interact with real tools and APIs, operate under partial information, and recover from errors in stateful, permissioned environments—highlighting a persistent gap between research success and production reliability.
OpenEnv is an open-source framework from Meta and Hugging Face designed to address this challenge by standardizing how agents interact with real environments. As part of this collaboration, Turing contributed a production-grade calendar management environment to study tool-using agents under realistic constraints such as access control, temporal reasoning, and multi-agent coordination.

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles It has become increasingly challenging to assess whether a model’s
reported improvements reflect genuine advances or variations in
evaluation conditions, dataset composition, or training data that
mirrors benchmark tasks. The NVIDIA Nemotron approach to openness
addresses this by publishing transparent and reproducible evaluation
recipes that make results independently verifiable.
NVIDIA released Nemotron 3 Nano 30B
A3B
with an explicitly open evaluation approach to make that distinction
clear. Alongside the model card, we are publishing the complete
evaluation recipe used to generate the results, built with the
NVIDIA NeMo
Evaluator library, so
anyone can rerun the evaluation pipeline, inspect the artifacts, and
analyze the outcomes independently.
We believe that open innovation is the foundation of AI progress. This
level of transparency matters because most model evaluations omit
critical details. Configs, prompts, harness versions, runtime settings,
and logs are often missing or underspecified, and even small differences
in these parameters can materially change results. Without a complete
recipe, it’s nearly impossible to tell whether a model is genuinely
more intelligent or si

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles The past year has been all about giving LLMs more tools and autonomy to solve more complex and open ended tasks. The goal of the Jupyter Agent is to give the model the ultimate tool: code execution. A natural way to display multi-step code execution together with reasoning is within a Jupyter Notebook, which consists of code and markdown cells. So we built Jupyter Agent to act as an agent that can execute code directly inside a Jupyter notebook and use this environment to solve data analysis and data science tasks. Think of it like Cursor, but living natively inside your data science workflow.We built a demo of this vision with Qwen-3 Coder, currently one of the strongest coding models. This is a follow-up to our earlier work on jupyter-agent (v1).
While large models are starting to show useful behavior, the key question is how we can continue improving them. To this end, we focus on strengthening smaller models to perform well on agentic data science tasks as they currently struggle to compete with the large models.
The goal of this project is to build a pipeline to first generate high-quality training data, then fine-tune an existing small model, and finally evaluate whether the model's performance improves on relevant benchmarks.

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles Evaluation is broken What We're Shipping Why This Matters Get Started TL;DR: Benchmark datasets on Hugging Face can now host leaderboards. Models store their own eval scores. Everything links together. The community can submit results via PR. Verified badges prove that the results can be reproduced. Evaluation is broken Let's be real about where we are with evals in 2026. MMLU is saturated above 91%. GSM8K hit 94%+. HumanEval is conquered. Yet some models that ace benchmarks still can't reliably browse the web, write production code, or handle multi-step tasks without hallucinating, based on usage reports. There is a clear gap between benchmark scores and real-world performance.
Furthermore, there is another gap within reported benchmark scores. Multiple sources report different results. From Model Cards, to papers, to evaluation platforms, there is no alignment in reported scores. The result is that the community lacks a single source of truth. What We're Shipping Decentralized and transparent evaluation reporting.
We are going to take evaluations on the Hugging Face Hub in a new direction by decentralizing reporting

**Source:** Hugging Face Blog | **Keyword:** `AI`
Back to Articles Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) extends traditional LLM training by optimizing not just a single-turn response, but an entire decision-making process learned through direct interaction with an environment during training. Unlike traditional single-turn reinforcement learning or offline preference-based methods that rely on static datasets, agentic RL trains policies by actively collecting on-policy data as the agent plans actions, invokes tools, observes outcomes, and adapts its behavior over multi-step trajectories in either simulated or real environments. This interaction-driven optimization assigns credit across long-horizon decisions, where intermediate choices such as query reformulation, tool selection, and execution order directly influence downstream success. Training follows an iterative closed loop in which the agent interacts with the environment to collect rollout trajectories, computes rewards over these trajectories, updates the policy based on observed outcomes, and then uses the updated policy to drive the next round of interaction and data collection such as GRPO or PPO algorithms..

Back to Articles What is Open Responses? What do we need to know to build with Open Responses? Client Requests to Open Responses Changes for Inference Clients and Providers Open Responses for Routing Tools Sub Agent Loops Next Steps Open Responses is a new and open inference standard. Initiated by OpenAI, built by the open source AI community, and backed by the Hugging Face ecosystem, Open Responses is based on the Responses API and is designed for the future of Agents. In this blog post, we’ll look at how Open Responses works and why the open source community should use Open Responses.
The era of the chatbot is long gone, and agents dominate inference workloads. Developers are shifting toward autonomous systems that reason, plan, and act over long-time horizons. Despite this shift, much of the ecosystem still uses the Chat Completion format, which was designed for turn-based conversations and falls short for agentic use cases. The Responses format was designed to address these limitations, but it is closed and not as widely adopted. The Chat Completion format is still the de facto standard despite the alt

La voiture électrique progresse. Ce qui vacille, en revanche, c’est la crédibilité de ceux qui ont promis d’aller trop vite. Après avoir annoncé des objectifs inatégnables pour passer leur gamme au 100 % électrique, plusieurs constructeurs rétropédalent sans surprise. Un comportement que je souhaitais épingler dans l'édito Watt Else du 19 février 2026.

**Source:** The Verge | **Keyword:** `AI`
Arturia launched a new version of its flagship effects suite, FX Collection, which includes two new plugins, EFX Ambient and Pitch Shifter-910. FX Collection 6 also marks the introduction of an Intro version with a selection of six effects covering the basics for $99. That pales in comparison to the 39 effects in the full FX Collection Pro, but that also costs $499.
Pitch Shifter-910 is based on the iconic Eventide H910 Harmonizer from 1974, an early digital pitchshifter and delay with a very unique character. Arturia does an admirable job preserving its glitchy quirks. Pitch Shifter-910 is not a transparent effect that lets you create natu …

**Source:** The Verge | **Keyword:** `AI`
Welcome to the weekend, folks! The Reviews and Guides team here at The Verge is gearing up for all things Unpacked, but Samsung isn’t the only one readying new phones. Google just announced the Pixel 10A, which, for you early adopters, is already up for preorder with a $100 gift card. Elsewhere in deal land, you’ll find steep discounts on mopping vacuums, slight discounts on Soundcore’s cheap ANC headphones, and a rare discount on a new PC controller with swiveling sticks.
So, let’s get to it, shall we?
We finally have a release date for the Pixel 10A: March 5th. What’s more, if you’re thinking about picking up Google’s latest phone, you can already preorder the base-model configuration at Amazon and Best Buy with 128GB of storage and a $100 gift card for $499. Alternatively, Amazon is offering it with a free pair of the Pixel Buds 2A, a fantastic set of recently released earbuds that typically retail for $130.
Despite being a pretty minimal update, Google’s forthcoming Android handset is a pretty solid deal. It doesn’t adopt a lot of features from the flagship Pixel 10 series; however, last year’s Tensor G4 chip is still speedy enough for most tasks, satellite SOS is handy, and you get slightly faster wired and wireless charging. More importantly, it still comes with seven years of OS and security updates, which, personally, I’d take over Magic Cue, Pixel Screenshots, and other AI-based tools any day of the week.
Read our hands-on impressions.
Google Pixel 10A Where to Buy: $599 $499 at Amazon (free $100 gift card) $629 $499 at Amazon (free Pixel Buds 2A) $599 $499 at Best Buy (free $100 gift card) Twelve. That’s how many AC outlets Anker’s 351 Power Strip — which is now available in black or white from Amazon and Anker for $23.99 ($6 off) — packs into its 9.65-inch, surge-protected build. The beefy power strip also features a 20W USB-C port and two USB-A ports, both of which can deliver up to 15W of juice. Just keep in mind that, like with most power strips and like-minded chargers, you’ll have to split power amongst the USB ports, which are limited to a max output of 15W when charging multiple devices simultaneously.
Anker 351 Power Strip Where to Buy: $29.99 $23.99 at Amazon $29.99 $23.99 at Anker (with code WS7DV2YWISTS) I’m admittedly not a huge fan of fighting games — I have no patience for learning combos, dear readers — but the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot seems like a good compromise if I were forced to choose between a traditional controller and one specifically built for hammering out hadokens. And now, the novel gamepad is on sale at both Amazon and Best Buy for $99.99 ($40 off), its lowest price to date.
Although Turtle Beach’s wireless PC controller offers a slew of welcome components, including drift-free Hall effect joysticks and adjustable trigger stops, its defining feature is a pair of rotating modules that can “pivot” to reveal a customizable controller layout that’s better suited for retro titles and fighting games. You also get programmable back buttons, the ability to save up to five profiles, and a 3.5mm audio jack, not to mention compatibility with mobile devices over Bluetooth and Xbox consoles via a wired connection.
Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot Where to Buy: $139.99 $99.99 at Amazon $139.99 $99.99 at Best Buy If you’re looking for a cheap(ish) set of noise-canceling headphones, Soundcore’s Space One are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and directly from Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) in all four colors for $79.99 ($20 off), matching their second-best price to date.
During Cyber Monday last year, our own John Higgins waxed poetic about the over-ear cans, namely because they deliver impressive sound and comfort for the price. The sound quality and ANC don’t rival the flagships from Sony or Bose, sure, but you can try over 20 different presets or tweak the sound yourself using the eight-band equalizer in Anker’s companion app. They can also last up to 40 hours with ANC enabled, meaning you should be able to fly from New York to Singapore and back again without ever having to charge them.
Soundcore Space One Where to Buy: $99 $79.99 at Amazon $99.99 $79.99 at Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) $99.99 $79.99 at Walmart More ways to save this weekend
Google’s refreshed Nest Cam Indoor, which launched in October, is already down to a new low of $74.99 ($25 off) at Amazon. The wired camera supports 2K HDR video and offers a taller and wider field of view than prior models, along with a new sensor for full-color low-light video. It also comes in a new berry color, which, for better or worse, seems to be Google’s latest obsession.

**Source:** The Verge | **Keyword:** `AI`
I've always wanted to go skydiving. Aerial_Knight's DropShot, from indie developer Aerial_Knight, lets me live out that dream - at least in a safe, virtual kind of way. It also lets me shoot bullets from finger guns, wield laser skulls, and wear cool sunglasses while I'm falling through the air. So maybe it's better than the real thing.
Playing as a character named Smoke Wallace, who was bitten by a dragon that gave him the finger gun that can actually shoot bullets, you plummet toward the ground and try to pick off bad guys with that finger gun or by punching them up close.

Lorsque m'est venue l'idée saugrenue de proposer un « top » des Zelda pour célébrer les 40 ans de la franchise, je me suis immédiatement posé une question : existe-t-il une licence dont il est potentiellement aussi difficile de classer les épisodes en termes de qualité globale ? Face à l'excellence quasi unanimement constatée des épisodes de la série principale, le défi semblait insurmontable, et pourtant, j'ai quand même décidé de le relever. Ce top ne va assurément plaire à personne, mais ça en dit long sur le niveau stratosphérique des jeux The Legend of Zelda dans leur ensemble.

Antonio Filosa attends the presentation of the new Fiat 500 Hybrid at the Stellantis FIAT Mirafiori plant in Turin, Italy, in November of 2025. | Elisa Marchina/NurPhoto via Getty Images Demand for EVs has gone glacial, and one automaker after another is running aground: General Motors threw $7.6 billion overboard. Ford washed $19.5 billion off its books. Leave it to Stellantis to face the most titanic charge yet, a $26.5 billion bill for its own misplaced bet on EVs. The Jeep, Dodge, and Chrysler parent company hasn't said how much of that unfathomable sum is explicitly due to EV losses, as the write-down wiped away about 25 percent of the company's stock value overnight. Every automaker faces the same cooling EV demand and whipsawing political climate, yet Stellantis appears the most exposed, due in part to longstanding …

Any ebook reader will let you cram a Beauty and the Beast-sized library’s worth of books in your pocket, but so will your phone. An ebook reader offers a more book-like reading experience, with fewer distractions and less eye strain, and many include extra features, like adjustable frontlighting. Some really are pocketable. Others are waterproof or offer physical page-turning buttons, while a few even let you take notes.
I’ve been using ebook readers for more than a decade, and I’ve gone hands-on with dozens, from the Kindle Paperwhite to lesser-known rivals like the PocketBook Era. Whether you want something your kid can throw against the wall or a waterproof, warm-glow Kindle that won’t ruin your spa ambiance, these are the best ebook readers for everyone. The best Kindle
Kindle Paperwhite (2024) Score: 8 ProsCons The best-looking screen on any e-reader
Slightly larger screen without a noticeably larger device
Faster page turns, loading, and a more responsive UI
A splash of color (without a color screen) Upgrades aren’t as significant as the last Paperwhite
Lacks stylus support and page turn buttons
Signature Edition wireless charging is frustrating without magnets
Signature Edition back panel feels less grippy Where to Buy: $159.99 at Amazon (with ads) $159.99 at Best Buy (with ads) $159.99 at Target (without ads) Dimensions: 7 x 5 x .3 inches / Weight: 211 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: IPX8 waterproofing, Bluetooth audio support If you mostly buy ebooks from Amazon, you’ll want a Kindle, and the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite is the best choice for most people. It’s $70 cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon e-reader — yet offers many of the same features, including a spacious 7-inch 300pi display with rich contrast levels. Unlike Amazon’s entry-level Kindle, it also features IPX8 water resistance and an adjustable warm frontlight that reduces blue light, which can interrupt melatonin production. The $199.99 Signature Edition Paperwhite also supports wireless charging, a rare feature in an e-reader.
Amazon dominates the US ebook market, so Kindle owners have access to advantages that owners of other ebook readers don’t. Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale at Amazon, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon.
There are downsides, though. The Paperwhite includes lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 to remove them, and its size can make one-handed reading uncomfortable. More significantly, like all Kindles, it uses a proprietary format and doesn’t natively support EPUB, the open standard used by most other ebook stores. If you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore, Barnes &amp; Noble, or Google Play Books, you’ll need to convert and transfer file formats in order to read them on a Kindle. If you mostly stick with Amazon, though, you’ll be more than happy with the Paperwhite.

The best non-Amazon ebook reader
Kobo Libra Colour (32GB, ad-free) ProsCons Nice color screen with sharp, 300ppi black-and-white resolution
Physical page-turning buttons
Built-in stylus support
Compatible with Overdrive Getting books from other stores onto the device can be tough
More expensive than the Kindle Paperwhite
Lacks the vibrancy of other color e-readers
No wireless charging Where to Buy: $229.99 at Amazon $229.99 at Rakuten Kobo $229.99 at Target Dimensions: 5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches / Weight: 199.5 grams / Screen area and resolution: 7-inch screen, 300ppi (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support The Kobo Libra Colour is a great alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, particularly for readers outside the US or anyone who prefers not to buy into Amazon’s ecosystem. It offers many of the standout features found on the 12th-gen Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C, and a 300ppi display — along with a few extra perks. Most notably, it uses E Ink’s latest Kaleido color technology, delivering soft, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. Resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing color, but it still makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant, even if images aren’t nearly as vivid as those on a traditional tablet or the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition.
Unlike Amazon’s Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Libra Colour also works with a stylus (sold separately), letting you highlight in multiple colors, annotate books, and use Kobo’s integrated notebooks. It borrows some more advanced tools from the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, including handwriting-to-text conversion and math-solving, allowing it to double as a small digital notebook. It also includes physical page-turn buttons, lacks lockscreen ads, supports more file formats (including EPUB), and makes borrowing from OverDrive libraries relatively straightforward. A recent update even provides support for Instapaper, letting you save articles, blog posts, and other content for offline viewing.
However, at $229.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required to perform certain tasks. The gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which happens more frequently. The Libra Colour also can’t easily access Amazon’s ebook library, either, so longtime Kindle users may need third-party tools to convert their purchases. Still, if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Libra Colour offers the most versatile and enjoyable reading experience of any e-reader on this list. It remains my personal favorite.

The best cheap ebook reader
Kindle (2024) ProsCons Excellent, high-resolution display
Easy to hold with one hand
Faster than its predecessor with improved battery life
Fun color options No waterproofing
Lacks adjustable color temperature
Slightly more expensive than its predecessor Where to Buy: $109.99 at Amazon (with ads) $109.99 at Best Buy (with ads) $129.99 at Amazon (without ads) Dimensions: 6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches / Weight: 158 grams / Screen area and resolution: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution / Storage: 16GB / Other features: USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support The base-model Kindle ($109.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it has USB-C for relatively fast charging. Reading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids — especially the Amazon Kindle Kids Edition, which costs $20 more. The kid-friendly version shares the same specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also includes six months of Amazon Kids Plus, which grants kids access to thousands of children’s books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to pay $79 per year (or $48 with Amazon Prime).
The base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the waterproofing, which you’ll find in the entry-level Kobo Clara BW and aforementioned Kindle Paperwhite. You also don’t get the physical page-turning buttons found on entry-level e-readers like Barnes &amp; Noble’s Nook GlowLight 4e (though the Kindle is a lot snappier than the Nook). And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to remove ads. But if you can do without that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $110.
The best ebook reader for taking notes
Kobo Elipsa 2E ProsCons Intuitive note-taking features
Great e-reader
Adjustable warm light
Useful note-taking capabilities, including handwriting-to-text conversion Lacks native support for Kindle books
227ppi display isn’t as sharp as the competition
No note-summarization features Where to Buy: $399.99 at Walmart $399.99 at Target $399.99 at Amazon Dimensions: 7.6 x 8.94 x 0.30 inches / Weight: 390 grams / Screen area and resolution: 10.3-inches, 227ppi resolution / Storage: 32GB / Other features: Handwriting to text conversion, magnetic stylus, Bluetooth audio support Of all the large ebook readers I’ve tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because it’s a good e-reader with solid note-taking abilities. You can write directly on pages just as in a physical book. The Kindle Scribe lets you annotate book pages as well, but it’s complicated, involving resizable text boxes that mess up the page formatting and prevent you from doing basic things like circling words. In contrast, taking notes on the Elipsa 2E feels far more intuitive and natural.
The Elipsa 2E offers other helpful note-taking tools and capabilities. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online and convert handwriting to typed text. The Kindle Scribe offers the latter capability, too, but again, Kobo does it faster and better within the original notebook document rather than on a separate page. The only thing missing from the Elipsa 2E is the Scribe’s note-summarization feature, but that’s a tradeoff I am okay with given how much easier it is to take notes.
Note-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo devices. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen balances things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not a noticeable drawback. Plus, the Elipsa 2E comes with an adjustable warm light for nighttime reading. That’s a feature rival e-readers with more advanced note-taking capabilities — including the $409.99 Onyx Boox Go 10.3, which lets you insert links to notes — lack.
Other ebook readers we tested
There are some other ebook readers my colleagues and I have tested that I didn’t feature above, but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable:
Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition
The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is the first Kindle to feature E Ink’s color screen technology, and it stands out from other color e-paper devices with customizations. It offers improved contrast, more vibrant colors, and faster screen refreshes. With a $279.99 price tag, it’s the most expensive Kindle model currently available that doesn’t support a stylus for note-taking, and it includes premium features like wireless charging that are convenient but not really necessary for a device with months of battery life. If you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon, the Colorsoft Signature is your best option. – Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter Kindle Colorsoft

Xbox ex boss and new Xbox boss | Image: Microsoft After nearly 40 years at Microsoft, Xbox chief and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer is leaving the company, along with Xbox president Sarah Bond. Spencer’s retirement was announced in a memo from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on February 20th, stating, “Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning.” Last summer, Microsoft responded to rumors of Spencer’s retirement, saying at the time that he was “not retiring anytime soon.” Microsoft’s CoreAI president, Asha Sharma, will be moving into Spencer’s former role as Microsoft Gaming CEO, while Matt Booty is being promoted to EVP and chief content officer.

La neige fera son retour en Île-de-France ce dimanche 15 février, tout comme sur d'autres régions du nord et du nord-est de la France - Image d'illustration (vue depuis notre caméra meteo-paris.com) Des chutes de neige relativement éphémères auront lieu ce dimanche jusqu'en plaine entre les Hauts-de-France, tout le Bassin parisien et le nord-est du pays. D'autres épisodes pourraient avoir lieu la semaine prochaine. Retour très bref de la neige en plaine L'invasion polaire continentale qui a eu lieu samedi, fut de courte durée, rapidement remplacée par une poussée océanique plus douce. Si l’air froid persiste sur une grande partie de la France ce dimanche, un nouveau front pluvieux traverse rapidement le pays par l’Ouest. Ce front est accompagné d’un net redoux en altitude, mais la pluie est temporairement précédée de neige pendant quelques heures, là où la couche d’air froid sera suffisamment épaisse. Dimanche matin, la Normandie et l’Île-de-France ont connu des chutes de neige moins importantes que prévues, la perturbation s’étant scindée en deux. La neige a principalement touché un axe s’étendant du Limousin aux Pays de la Loire et au Centre, avant de se réactiver sur les Hauts-de-France, la Champagne-Ardenne et la Lorraine dans l’après-midi et la soirée. Évolution prévue des zones enneigées entre dimanche 8h et lundi 3h – (réactualisation de dimanche 6h - Modèle CEP via meteociel) Quelques centimètres, notamment sur les plateaux Ainsi, les cumul de neige ont été revus à la baisse de la Normandie à l'Île-de-France, mais pas forcément ailleurs. Paris n'a par exemple pas du tout été blanchie. Dimanche en fin de journée, les épaisseurs de neige pourraient dépasser 5 cm entre le nord du département de l'Aisne, ainsi que les Ardennes et le nord de la Lorraine. Épaisseurs de neige maximales prévue pour le dimanche 15 février 2026 (réactualisation de dimanche 6h) – Météo-Villes Une semaine à risque sur les régions du Nord et du nord-est Après le redoux de dimanche après-midi, l’air froid reprendra rapidement le dessus sur la moitié nord dès le début de la semaine. Une dépression, déviée vers le sud par l’air froid persistant au nord, devrait s’échouer sur la France entre mercredi soir et jeudi. Les précipitations, sous cet air froid, pourraient se transformer en neige. Il est cependant encore trop tôt pour déterminer précisément les régions concernées. Des chutes de neige significatives sont possibles, avec un risque accru entre la Normandie, l’Île-de-France et toutes les régions situées au nord de la Seine.

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Après l’épisode neigeux de dimanche (qui a finalement été moins important que prévu), la douceur est revenue rapidement. Cependant, de nouvelles chutes de neige pourraient se produire en limite de l’air froid mercredi matin. Un conflit avec l'air froid sur le nord de la France Dès mardi soir, de l’air froid en provenance de Scandinavie descendra vers l’Allemagne et la Belgique, et pourrait toucher toutes les régions situées au nord de la Seine. Dans cette zone, les températures seront négatives, tandis qu’au sud de la Loire, il fera facilement plus de 10°C. Les régions autour de la Seine seront donc au cœur d’un conflit avec des températures autour de 0 à 1°C et des précipitations causées par une dépression en Manche. Ces précipitations pourraient se transformer en neige, notamment en raison de l’isothermie engendrée par l’intensité et la persistance de ces dernières. Dans ce type de situation, tout est possible, car la formation de la neige dépend de la température et de l’intensité des précipitations. L'étendue et la localisation des chutes de neige régions dépendront également de la position de la dépression. Position des masses d'air à 850 hPa prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO européen pour mercredi matin - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Une zone de neige possible au niveau de la Seine ou au nord Depuis trois ou quatre jours, le modèle météo européen prévoit des chutes de neige au nord de la Seine, sur une bande d'environ 150 km de large. Ce secteur est souvent le théâtre de confrontations hivernales entre l’air froid scandinave et la douceur océanique, ce qui peut entraîner d’importantes chutes de neige. Les exemples ne manquent pas… Évolution des épaisseurs de neige prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO américain entre mercredi 00h et jeudi 7h - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Selon les cartes de prévision des épaisseurs de neige du modèle météo européen pour mercredi matin, il pourrait tomber entre 1 et 10 cm de neige dans cette zone. Cependant, cette carte pourrait exagérer les chutes de neige, comme ce fut le cas lors de l’épisode de dimanche matin. Ces prévisions dépendent évidemment du conflit, mais surtout des températures. Il est donc possible que seuls les plateaux situés à plus de 100 m d’altitude soient blanchis. Dans ce type de situation, les vallées connaissent généralement des températures trop élevées pour que la neige tienne réellement au sol. Épaisseurs de neige prévues par le modèle MÉTÉO européen pour mercredi matin - fond de carte Meteociel, retravaillé par Meteo-villes Le modèle américain envisage de la neige un peu plus au nord Le modèle météo européen n’est pas le seul à prévoir de la neige ce mercredi matin. Le modèle américain, quant à lui, anticipe un conflit à peu près calé sur la même zone, mais avec des épaisseurs qui semblent plus réalistes. Soyons honnêtes, certains modèles ne prévoient aucune neige, car les températures seraient trop élevées pour sa formation. Dans ces situations « limites », les prévisions météo sont délicates, même à quelques heures d’échéance.

Le château de Versailles sous la neige dans une ambiance polaire le 15 février 2010 – Archives Météo-Villes Un mois de janvier exceptionnellement neigeux ! Après un automne 2009 plutôt doux, l'hiver a fait un retour remarqué dès le mois de décembre sur la France. Une première vague de froid s'est en effet propagée jusqu'à la France à partir du 13 décembre avec de l’air glacial venu de Russie envahissant tout le pays et de la neige sur de nombreuses régions, atteignant même la région de Nice le 18 décembre. Cette première vague de froid se termine quasiment le jour de Noël, mais la douceur qui caractérise les derniers jours de l’année ne sera que très éphémère. Après une courte pause plus douce donc, le froid revient de plus belle à partir du 31 décembre 2009. Le début du mois de janvier 2010 est ainsi très hivernal sur la quasi totalité de la France avec de première chutes de neige le 1er janvier entre les côtes de la Manche et l'Île-de-France (10cm en Seine-Maritime). Les 3 et 4 janvier, c'est sur le sud de la France que la neige se montre plus étendue, tombant du Poitou à la région Rhône-Alpes en passant par le Limousin et l'Auvergne, on mesure 20cm à Grenoble, 13cm à Lyon et 8cm à Clermont-Ferrand. 8 cm à Lyon le 4 janvier 2010 – Archives Météo-Villes Le 6 janvier, la neige tombe par averses en Normandie avec 20cm mesurés à Honfleur. Le lendemain, on mesure 30cm à Alençon, 20cm à Dreux, Chartres et entre le sud du 78, 91 et 77 au passage d'une goutte froide alors qu'il neige également sur le sud-est entre le Languedoc-Roussillon et la Camargue puis jusqu'en vallée du Rhône et dans les Alpes la nuit suivante. Alors que la matinée du 8 janvier est glaciale dans le nord du pays avec jusqu'à -20,6°C 0 Brétigny-sur-Orge, battant le record de 1985, de très fortes chutes de neige persistent sur le sud. On mesure jusqu'à 50cm à Gap, 35cm à Grenoble, 30cm à Orange et même 20cm en Camargue. Ces chutes persistent le lendemain avec des cumuls devenant impressionnants dans l'intérieur du Languedoc-Roussillon jusqu'au Tarn. Certains villages d'altitude sont coupés du monde avec parfois plus de 50 à 60cm cumulés ! 60cm de neige le 9 janvier 2010 aux Martys (900m) dans le département de l'Aude – Photographie : meteo81 La neige remonte d'ailleurs de nouveau sur le nord du pays durant cette journée, apportant 2 à 10cm supplémentaires jusqu'en Alsace, Bourgogne, Franche Comté et même en Bretagne. De très nombreuses région françaises sont ainsi sous la neige. Après une nouvelle perturbation accompagnée de neige (3 à 7cm sur une large partie du nord et de l'est du pays) et de pluie verglaçantes entre les Pays de la Loire, la Bretagne et la Basse-Normandie, le temps se montrera plus sec jusqu'au 20 janvier avec un redoux très progressif sur la majorité du pays. Celui-ci restera néanmoins une nouvelle-fois de courte durée. Une troisième vague de froid envahira en effet la France à partir du 25 janvier 2010. Le 28 janvier, de nouvelles averses de neige ont déjà lieu sur un large quart nord-est jusqu'au nord des Alpes avnat une perturbatioj plus active le lendemain, apportant des chutes plus franches en Champagne-Ardenne, Lorraine, Bourgogne, Franche-Comté et au sud de l’Alsace. La neige tient surtout au-dessus de 300m d’altitude. Le 31 janvier, la neige atteint de nouveau la Côte d'Azur avec plusieurs centimètres entre Nice et Fréjus, surtout entre Cannes et Saint-Raphaël où les plages sont bien blanchies. Dans le même temps, on mesure -14°C à Aurillac et -11°C à Nevers. Plages blanchies par la neige à Cannes le 31 janvier 2010 au matin – Archives Météo-Villes Un mois de février tout aussi hivernal ! Le mois de février débute donc sous le froid et la neige sur de nombreuses régions. Dès le 1er févier, des chutes de neige sont observées sur une partie du nord et de l'est avec par exemple 5/7cm à Lyon. Le 2 février, on mesure 30cm de neige dès 200m d'altitude dans le nord-est avant un net redoux entre le 3 et le 4 sur la totalité du pays. À La Mure, on passe par exemple de -16,9°C en début de nuit à 10.7°C durant la journée ! Encore une fois, le redoux restera temporaire puisque la 4ème vague de froid de la saison envahira la France le 9 février avec notamment le retour de la neige sur le nord dès la fin de journée. Le 10 février, on observe des averses de neige sur une large partie du nord et du centre du pays, plus fréquentes sur le Pas-de-Calais. C'est néanmoins le 11 février que la neige va se montrer plus généralisée et même parfois forte une nouvelle-fois sur la Côte d'Azur. On mesure en effet 5cm à Nice en fin de journée du 11 février, 10 à 15cm à Cannes et jusqu'à 30-40cm dans la région de Grasse dès 200m d'altitude ! Les jours suivants seront plus secs mais généralement glaciales sur la quasi-totalité du pays, excepté entre la pointe Bretonne, la Côte d'Azur et le littoral de la Corse avec des gelées généralisées et parfois fortes, les minimales descendant souvent sous les -10/-15°C. Les chutes de neige successives et le froid deviennent pesants pour bon nombre de français - Une du 10 février 2010 Cette 4ème vague de froid prendra fin le 17 février avec la reprise d'un flux océanique très perturbé mais aussi plus doux. Plusieurs tempêtes successives concerneront d'ailleurs la France à la fin du mois de février, notamment la fameuse tempête Xynthia le 27 février au soir. L'hiver n'avait néanmoins pas dit son dernier mot, celui-ci faisant un dernier retour durant le mois de mars. Ce début d'année 2010 fut donc exceptionnellement neigeux sur notre pays, le plus neigeux depuis l'hiver 1986-1987, si bien que peu de régions ont été épargnées par les flocons entre décembre, janvier et février.

### 4. `FR` [Pourquoi pleut-il autant depuis le début de l'année ?](data/articles/f1dd309871e590f5e4636c0fe9e1d43a.html)
**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
La pluie n'en finit plus de tomber sur la France, causant des crues majeures dans la moitié ouest. expliquer qu'il pleut autant depuis le début de l'année et cette situation est-elle exceptionnelle ? Notre article vous explique. Une circulation atmosphérique atypique Depuis le début de l'année 2026, le courant jet circule à des latitudes plus basses qu'en temps normal. Il a longuement ondulé de la côte est des États-Unis vers les Açores avant de passer par la péninsule ibérique et la Méditerranée. Ainsi, il a permis aux dépressions de s'enchaîner sur la péninsule ibérique et la Méditerranée avec des pluies affectant une grande partie de la France. En remontant quelque peu, ce jet passe désormais au dessus de la France et maintient l'agitation. De plus, ajoutons que les vagues de froid nord-américaines ont dynamisé l'activité dépressionnaire sur l'Atlantique. En arrivant au dessus de l'océan, l'air polaire favorise le creusement des dépressions, qui traversent ensuite l'Atlantique vers l'Europe. Schéma montrant la circulation basse en latitude du courant jet fin janvier et début février 2026 - Météo Villes Ainsi, cela fait maintenant plusieurs semaines que l'activité dépressionnaire est particulièrement marquée sur notre pays et globalement sur tout l'ouest de l'Europe. Sur la période du 1er janvier au 15 février 2026, l'anomalie de pression atteint -19 hPa par rapport à la normale au large de la Bretagne ! Un tel déficit sur une période de 45 jours est spectaculaire et témoigne de l'activité dépressionnaire hors norme qu'a subi la France. Si vous consultez régulièrement votre baromètre, vous avez surement remarqué que la pression est souvent très basse depuis le début de l'année 2026. Anomalie de pression du 1er janvier au 15 février 2026 - keraunos.org Des cumuls de pluie vraiment remarquables Sur les 45 premiers jours de l'année, 39 ont enregistré au moins 1 mm de pluie en moyenne nationale ! Cela signifie que 87% des jours ont été pluvieux en France depuis le début 2026, un chiffre remarquable ! Non seulement la pluie a été anormalement fréquente mais elle est aussi anormalement abondante. La Bretagne symbolise cet excès de pluie avec des cumuls tout bonnement remarquables. Au 18 février, il est déjà tombé 566 mm de pluie à Quimper depuis le début de l'année ! Cela représente 260% du cumul normal, c'est à dire qu'il est tombé 2,6 fois plus de pluie que lors d'un début d'année moyen ! Jamais de telles pluies n'avaient été observées depuis le début des mesures. Sur le graphique ci-dessous, on note l'absence d'accalmie avec des courbes qui croissent presque continuellement. Cumuls de pluie sur plusieurs villes bretonnes depuis le début de l'année 2026 - Le Parisien Autre indicateur qui permet de montrer que ce début d'année 2026 est véritablement exceptionnel : l'indice d'humidité des sols atteint des records. En effet, en date du 17 février 2026, l'indice moyenné à échelle nationale est à son plus haut niveau depuis le début des mesures pour cette époque de l'année. D'ailleurs, il arrive même sur le podium des situations où les sols ont été les plus humides en France, toutes dates confondues. Seuls décembre 1982 et janvier 1994, théâtres de graves inondations, avaient connu une humidité moyenne légèrement supérieure à la situation actuelle. Indice d'humidité des sols en moyenne nationale du 18 février 2025 au 17 février 2026 - Météo France En résumé : la situation actuelle est véritablement remarquable avec des crues spectaculaires générées par des pluies parfois records, elles-mêmes liées à une séquence remarquablement dépressionnaire, tant par son intensité que sa durée.

Crue majeure de la Loire à Béhuard (49) ce mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Jérémy Girault De nombreux cours d'eau débordent dans l'ouest de la France et certaines crues sont majeures. La situation ne va pas s'arranger car de nouvelles pluies copieuses sont prévues dans les prochaines heures. Notre article fait le point sur la situation. Crues majeures et nouvelles pluies à venir La situation reste particulièrement tendue d'un point de vue hydrométrique dans la moitié ouest de la France où de nombreux cours d'eau étaient encore en vigilance orange ce mardi 17 février 2026. Certains tronçons sont même en vigilance ROUGE : la Garonne marmandaise et girondine, la Loire saumuroise et les basses vallées angevines et, plus dernièrement, la Charente-aval. Ces tronçons de l'ouest de la France subissent actuellement des crues majeures et, pour certains, vont encore monter dans les prochaines heures. Carte de vigilance des cours d'eau émise le mardi 17 février 2026 à 16h - Vigicrues Pour ne rien arranger, la pluie n'en finit plus de tomber. Une nouvelle onde pluvieuse gagne le nord-ouest de la France en nuit du mardi 17 au mercredi 18 février 2026 et plusieurs passages pluvieux balayeront l'hexagone mercredi et jeudi. Sur les 48 prochaines heures, il faut s'attendre à plusieurs dizaines de millimètres supplémentaires sur tout le nord, le centre et l'ouest de la France, ainsi que dans les Alpes. Les cumuls vont atteindre 50 à 70 mm dans l'ouest et le sud de la Bretagne et sur le sud-ouest du Massif Central, sur des sols déjà saturés ! L'ampleur des crues va donc encore croître... Cumuls de pluie modélisés les mercredi 18 et jeudi 19 février 2026 - meteologix.com Plusieurs secteurs lourdement impactés Si la Garonne a atteint son pic dimanche et a depuis entamé une très lente décrue, le pire est encore à venir dans le Maine-et-Loire où plusieurs cours d'eau ont été placés en vigilance ROUGE. Ce niveau maximal d'alerte concerne la Mayenne, Loire, la Maine et la Sarthe dans les basses vallées angevines. Ce mardi 17 février 2026, la crue de la Maine causait des inondations notables sur la promenade de Reculée à Angers et le niveau va continuer de monter probablement jusqu'au milieu de la semaine.

Une dépression très creuse va apporter des vents forts et de nouvelles pluies abondantes sur la France en milieu de semaine Vents forts et nouvelles pluies intenses sont attendues au passage d'une dépression bien creuse sur la France entre mercredi 18 et jeudi 19 février 2026. Le niveau de certains cours d'eau étant déjà très élevé, cette nouvelle tempête laisse craindre le pire. Un temps restant agité dans les prochains jours L’influence océanique perturbée persiste en cette mi-février. Sous l’effet d’un courant jet survolant la France, de nouvelles perturbations sont attendues dans les prochains jours, avec plusieurs zones dépressionnaires circulant sur l’ouest de l’Europe jusqu’au week-end. La situation nécessitera une vigilance particulière entre mercredi et jeudi. Une dépression secondaire devrait se former rapidement en marge d’une zone dépressionnaire au large de l’Irlande, se dirigeant vers la Bretagne puis vers l’Italie jeudi. Cette dépression assez creuse devrait entraîner un temps très agité sur le pays, marqué par des vents forts et de fortes précipitations. Vents parfois forts, en limite du niveau de tempête Alors qu’un creusement dépressionnaire notable se dirige vers notre pays, les vents vont se renforcer sur une partie ouest et sud de la France entre mercredi et jeudi. Les vents les plus forts devraient suivre une trajectoire similaire à celle de la tempête Nils, mais heureusement, ils ne devraient pas atteindre la même intensité. C'est donc notamment entre la façade Atlantique, le sud-ouest et les abords de la Méditerranée que les rafales les plus fortes sont attendues entre mercredi soir et jeudi avec parfois plus de 90-100 voire 140 km/h sur les secteurs les plus exposés. Ceci restera néanmoins à confirmer d'ici là. Rafales maximales de vent prévues d'ici vendredi matin, selon le modèle météo européen - via Meteociel Des pluies abondantes et une aggravation des inondations Outre les vents parfois forts, il conviendra également de surveiller le risque de nouvelles fortes précipitations au passage de cette dépression sur notre pays. En effet, entre les pluies parfois abondantes de ce lundi, surtout sur le sud et l'est de la France et le passage de la dépression PEDRO, les cumuls de précipitations s'annoncent de nouveau très importants entre mardi midi et jeudi soir, y compris dans le bassin de la Seine et de la Loire. Cumuls de précipitations attendus entre mardi matin et jeudi soir – Modèle européen via Meteociel Or, ces précipitations toucheront des secteurs déjà particulièrement durement touchées ces dernières semaines, secteurs où les inondations sont déjà nombreuses et parfois importantes depuis la semaine dernière. C'est notamment le cas d'une large partie ouest de la France où la quasi-totalité des cours d'eau sont en crue et où la Garonne, la Loire Saumuroise et les basses vallées angevines subissent une crue historique. Carte Vigicrues du 18 février 2026 à 09h56 Les précipitations de ce début de semaine, suivies du passage de la dépression entre mercredi et jeudi, risquent d’aggraver considérablement la situation actuelle dans ce secteur, laissant craindre des crues généralisées et potentiellement importantes. Un coefficient de marée et une forte houle aggravant la situation Et comme si cela ne suffisait pas, ces intempéries surviennent au plus mauvais moment. Bien qu’il ne s’agisse pas de marées d’équinoxe, les coefficients restent particulièrement élevés (96 et 97), et la houle générée par cette dépression profonde pourrait dépasser les 6 mètres de hauteur sur la façade Atlantique jeudi matin. Cette situation risque de freiner l’écoulement des cours d’eau et, par conséquent, d’aggraver encore davantage les inondations.

Quantités de neige remarquables à La Rosière en Savoie (73) le mercredi 18 février 2026 - photo Météo Tarentaise Les stations des Alpes croulent sous plusieurs mètres de neige, perturbant la vie quotidienne. D'importantes avalanches se déclenchent, coupant parfois les routes d'accès aux stations. Sur place, les images sont impressionnantes ! Parfois 3 mètres dans les stations ! Les quantités de neige sont actuellement remarquables dans la plupart des massifs alpins, notamment entre les Hautes-Alpes, l'Isère, la Savoie et la Haute-Savoie. De nombreuses stations mesurent des quantités inédites depuis de nombreuses années, du fait de la succession d'épisodes perturbés depuis plusieurs semaines. La couche au sol atteint fréquemment entre 2 et 3 mètres vers 2000 mètres dans les stations, comme l'illustre le cliché ci-dessous pris à La Rosière en Savoie. La station de La Rosière ensevelie sous plusieurs mètres de neige le mardi 17 février 2026 - photo Météo Tarentaise Dans les stations, la vie est perturbée par ces quantités de neige remarquables. Se déplacer devient difficile voire impossible. Ceux qui n'ont pas bougé depuis plusieurs jours voient leurs véhicules parfois totalement ensevelis sous plusieurs mètres de neige ! Dans les rues, on se déplace dans de véritables tranchées creusées dans la neige et les toitures croulent sous un manteau neigeux particulièrement impressionnant, comme ici dans la station de Bessans.

Le dernier mois réellement hivernal en France remonte à février 2018, marqué par deux épisodes importants de chutes de neige et par des températures particulièrement basses, atteignant des niveaux qui n’ont pas (encore) été observés cette année. Sur les 95 vagues de froid observées en France depuis 1900, seule une vague de froid a été observée après 2015 et aucune depuis 2020… La dernière, date donc de février 2018... Source : Serge Saka Une première vague de froid au début du mois Entre le 4 et le 9 février 2018, la France replonge en plein hiver. Un puissant épisode de froid et de neige concerne près des deux tiers du pays, paralysant temporairement plusieurs régions. Tout commence le 5 février, lorsqu’une perturbation venue de Méditerranée remonte vers le nord. La neige tombe jusqu’en plaine sur le Massif central, gagne la vallée du Rhône, la Bourgogne, puis atteint l’Île-de-France en fin de journée. Le 6 février, la situation se complique nettement. Un épisode neigeux majeur frappe l’Île-de-France et les Pays de la Loire. Les chutes deviennent soutenues et tiennent au sol, y compris dans la capitale. Les conséquences sont spectaculaires : un record de 739 kilomètres d’embouteillages est enregistré autour de Paris, piégeant de nombreux automobilistes. Au matin du 7 février, le paysage est est blanc sur les 2/3 du territoire avec une épaisseurs de neige remarquables dans le Bassin parisien. On mesure jusqu’à 25 cm de neige localement, notamment à Vendôme, Dreux ou Versailles, et 12 cm à Paris-Montsouris. Le 8 février, le ciel se dégage mais le froid s’intensifie. Sur des sols enneigés, les températures plongent entre –13°C et –14°C localement, et descendent autour de –6°C à –7°C dans les aéroports parisiens. Enfin, le 9 février, une nouvelle perturbation océanique traverse l’air froid et apporte de nouvelles chutes de neige du Massif central vers l’Île-de-France et le nord du pays, prolongeant cet épisode hivernal marquant.

Il provoque en France une vague de froid courte mais intense, d’abord sèche, puis accompagnée de neige. Un premier épisode neigeux concerne l’extrême Sud-Est entre le 26 et le 27 février, lié à une instabilité débordant d’Italie. La neige tombe jusqu’en plaine et même sur le littoral entre le Var, les Alpes-Maritimes et l’est des Bouches-du-Rhône. Elle atteint Nice, Menton et surtout Ajaccio, qui se réveille le 27 février sous 15 cm de neige. La nuit des 27-28 février est glaciale sur l’ensemble du pays, avec des températures descendant sous –10°C sur près de la moitié de la France, y compris en Île-de-France, dans le Nord et le Centre. On relève notamment –14,3°C à Luxeuil-les-Bains, –13,4°C à Clermont-Ferrand et Nancy, –11°C à Creil, –10,3°C à Orléans et –10°C à Lyon-Bron. La vague de froid se termine entre le mercredi 28 février au matin et le jeudi 1er mars dans l’après-midi par un épisode neigeux plus généralisé, progressant du Sud-Ouest vers le Nord et le Nord-Ouest.

Les anomalies de température prévue pour mercredi prochain seront très importantes localement jusqu'à 12°C au-dessus des normales de saison ! Après de longues semaines marquées par une météo très agitée, entre pluies abondantes, vents violents et inondations, la situation commence enfin à s’améliorer. Même si l’hiver n’est pas encore terminé, la fin du mois de février annonce souvent les premiers signes du printemps — et c’est bien ce qui semble se profiler cette année. Retour de l'anticyclone des Açores Depuis plusieurs semaines, l’anticyclone des Açores nous délaisse. Positionné bien trop au sud, il laisse le courant perturbé océanique influencer l’ensemble de l’Europe, y compris la péninsule Ibérique. Dans ce contexte, la France connaît un temps particulièrement instable, ce qui explique des inondations de plus en plus étendues et marquées. La situation s’apprête toutefois à évoluer. Dès ce week-end, les hautes pressions devraient progressivement remonter vers l’Europe continentale. L’anticyclone se centrera alors sur l’Andalousie. Le flux d’ouest océanique restera présent sur la France, mais il sera nettement moins actif : les pluies se cantonneront principalement aux côtes de la Manche. Évolution de la masse d'air prévue entre mardi et mercredi - animation WRF Meteociel Parenthèse printanière d'une à deux journées À partir de lundi, et surtout mardi, les hautes pressions se décaleront davantage vers le continent. Le vent s’orientera au sud, favorisant la remontée d’un air très doux en provenance du Maroc. En cette fin février, le soleil gagne déjà en hauteur dans le ciel. Dans une telle configuration, les températures peuvent grimper plus facilement qu’au cœur de l’hiver. La période de la Saint-Valentin marque d’ailleurs souvent le début du réveil de la nature : certains oiseaux entament leur période de reproduction, ce qui serait à l’origine de cette fête. La fin du mois de février offre régulièrement une ou deux journées aux accents printaniers. Les journée de mardi et surtout mercredi devraient illustrer parfaitement cette tendance : le ciel sera enfin dégagé sur les trois quarts du pays et les températures dépasseront fréquemment les 15 °C l’après-midi. Avec un vent de sud soufflant au pied des Pyrénées, le seuil de chaleur pourrait même être approché, voire atteint localement, avec jusqu’à 25 °C sur le Pays basque. Prévisions des températures METEO-VILLES pour mercredi prochain Cette parenthèse printanière pourrait être d'assez courte durée. Dès jeudi, le courant perturbé océanique devrait reprendre le dessus, entraînant le retour des nuages, de quelques pluies par l’ouest et, mécaniquement, des températures un peu moins agréables, même si la douceur restera d’actualité.

Alors que la douceur va s'affirmer dans les prochains jours, on se demande si l'hiver est terminé en France. Toutefois, le passé lointain comme récent nous ont montré que l'hiver peut encore se manifester bien au delà du mois de février. Congères de 2 mètres à Gonneville dans le Cotentin (50) le 13 mars 2013 - via infoclimat.fr D'importantes coulées froides peuvent encore survenir Lorsque les jours rallongent et que le pôle Nord se réchauffe, le vortex polaire - qui concentre la majorité de l'air froid aux hautes latitudes - devient moins stable. C'est à dire qu'il devient de moins en moins compact. Il peut alors se déformer et entraîne avec lui des ondulations plus importantes du courant jet. Ainsi, des coulées d'air froid peuvent d'échapper du pôle en direction des latitudes moyennes comme la France. Il est donc tout à fait classique d'observer des coups de froid tardifs sur nos régions en mars, ce pourquoi il ne faut jamais enterrer l'hiver trop vite. Schéma d'un vortex polaire instable et d'un courant jet ondulant (classique au printemps) - NOAA Il suffit de regarder les relevés du passé pour se rendre compte qu'un froid marqué peut encore survenir au cours du mois de mars. À Paris-Montsouris, on peut encore descendre sous les -5°C durant la première partie du mois. L'exemple le plus récent date du 13 mars 2013 avec une température qui affichait -5,5°C à l'aube. De plus, on peut encore assister à des journées sans dégel jusqu'à début mars. D'ailleurs, le jour sans dégel le plus tardif est assez récent puisqu'il s'agissait également du 13 mars 2023 où le thermomètre n'avait pas dépassé -1,4°C dans la capitale ! Températures minimales et maximales les plus basses mesurées à Paris-Montsouris en mars depuis 1886 - infoclimat.fr Offensives hivernales en mars : des exemples récents Il est donc important de rappeler qu'il est beaucoup trop tôt pour enterrer l'hiver. Si l'hiver météorologique s'achève au 28 février, le froid et la neige en plaine peuvent encore se manifester bien après ! Rappelons qu'il peut encore neiger sur toute la France au cours du mois de mars. Il n'y a d'ailleurs pas besoin d'aller fouiller dans les archives lointaines pour retrouver des épisodes hivernaux marquants en mars. En 2010, l'agglomération de Perpignan s'était retrouvée sous 25 à 40 cm de neige le 8 mars et les températures plongeaient localement jusqu'à -10°C dans le nord-est de l'hexagone ! 30 à 40 cm de neige sur l'agglomération de Perpignan (66) le lundi 8 mars 2010 - Météo Villes Encore plus près de nous, on peut évoquer la tempête de neige historique qui s'était produite de la Bretagne à la Belgique le 12 mars 2013. La Normandie avait été la région la plus touchée et Météo France avait même déclenché la vigilance ROUGE neige dans la Manche et le Calvados. Le vent violent avait causé des congères atteignant 1 à 2 mètres de haut !

Encore un peu de patience : cette longue séquence agitée et pluvieuse avec des inondations touche probablement à sa fin. Après une période transitoire d'environ une à deux semaines, il semble que le mois de mars sera beaucoup plus sec. Vers le retour d’un temps plus calme ? Depuis plusieurs semaines, la France est soumise à un flux océanique humide et perturbé. Résultat : des pluies fréquentes, des épisodes venteux parfois soutenus et une instabilité persistante. Les périodes anticycloniques durables se sont faites rares, les hautes pressions peinant à s’installer avant d’être rapidement balayées par le retour des perturbations atlantiques. Une évolution plus favorable semble toutefois se dessiner à moyen et long terme. A partir de ce week-end, les modèles météo envisagent le retour de conditions anticycloniques sur la moitié Sud de la France et le courant-jet remontera vers le nord du continent. Cette configuration apportera un temps plus sec et plus calme pendant au moins quatre jours, et surtout sur les régions de l'Ouest et du Sud-ouest, durement éprouvées par les inondations. Le grand retour de l'anticyclone des Açores sur le sud-ouest de l'Europe ce week-end ! Carte de prévisions ECMWF pour samedi 21 février 2026 Une accalmie durable en perspective ? La prudence reste néanmoins de mise. Si les simulations précédentes suggéraient une installation prolongée des hautes pressions, les dernières tendances sont plus nuancées. Le flux océanique pourrait se remettre en place dès le mercredi 25 février jusqu'en fin de mois. Certains scénarios envisagent cependant un changement plus marqué au début du mois de mars, avec l’établissement d’un vaste anticyclone entre les Açores et le nord de l’Europe. Une telle configuration pourrait bloquer durablement les perturbations atlantiques et favoriser une période sèche prolongée sur la France. Il resterait toutefois à surveiller l’éventuelle formation d’une dépression isolée sur le sud du pays, susceptible de retarder cette stabilisation. Les tendances mensuelles pour mars vont même dans le sens d’un temps globalement plus sec. Si cette évolution se confirmait, elle trancherait nettement avec les conditions agitées récentes et constituerait une bonne nouvelle pour la gestion des crues et des inondations. Néanmoins, à cette échéance, les projections restent susceptibles d’évoluer. Il conviendra donc de suivre attentivement les prochaines mises à jour des modèles météorologiques.

Après plusieurs journées aux allures de printemps, marquées par une douceur exceptionnelle — jusqu’à 18 °C à Paris le 18 février 1958 — la situation bascule brutalement. Une masse d’air polaire déferle par le nord et le thermomètre s’effondre de 12 °C en seulement quelques heures. Tout le Nord-Pas-de-Calais paralysé après une nuit de cauchemar Dans la nuit du 25 au 26 février 1958, une violente tempête de neige frappe toute la moitié nord de la France, et particulièrement le Nord-Pas-de-Calais. En quelques heures, 10 à 15 cm de neige tombent, balayés par des rafales proches de 120 km/h. D’immenses congères se forment, bloquant routes et autoroutes. Des centaines d’automobilistes se retrouvent piégés dans leur véhicule, incapables d’avancer ou de faire demi-tour. En pleine nuit, des milliers de voitures sont abandonnées en rase campagne. Le bilan est dramatique : quatre personnes perdent la vie. Robert Lamoureux, Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle pris dans la tempête de neige Parmi les conducteurs pris au piège figure le fantaisiste Robert Lamoureux. En route de Bruxelles vers Paris au volant de sa voiture américaine, il se heurte à un véritable mur de neige près de Baisieux. Alors qu’il tente de se dégager, son véhicule s’embrase. Il réussit à s’extraire à temps, échappant de justesse à la catastrophe. Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle vivent eux aussi une nuit éprouvante. Après s’être rendus à Lille pour présenter le film « Ascenseur pour l’échafaud », dont elle est la vedette et lui le réalisateur, ils prennent la direction de Thumeries, au sud de Lille, où réside la famille de Louis Malle. Leur voiture est immobilisée par la neige près de Seclin. Ils ne seront secourus que le lendemain matin, vers 8 heures, par un camionneur, transis de froid. La DS ensevelie par la neige et dans laquelle Jeanne Moreau et Louis Malle ont été pris au piège durant une nuit, transis de froid - archives meteo-paris.com Cet épisode marque également un tournant médiatique. À la suite de cette tempête, Paul Douchy, prévisionniste à la Météorologie nationale, commence à présenter la météo quotidiennement à la télévision. Jusqu’alors, depuis le 17 décembre 1946, ce rendez-vous n’était proposé qu’une fois par semaine.

Bientôt le retour d'un temps plus calme ? Depuis plusieurs semaines, la France subit l’influence d’un courant océanique humide et perturbé, engendrant des précipitations fréquentes, des vents parfois tempétueux et un temps durablement instable. Jusqu'à présent, il était devenu rare d’enchaîner plusieurs jours de temps anticyclonique sur la France. Les hautes pressions ne parvenaient jamais à s’installer durablement, et le courant océanique reprenait rapidement le dessus. Cependant, une amélioration semble se profiler. Bien que le temps reste perturbé dans les prochains jours, les prévisions météorologiques annoncent le retour de conditions anticycloniques pour la fin de semaine sur la France et une partie de l’ouest de l’Europe. En effet, le courant-jet devrait circuler plus au nord de l’Europe en fin de semaine, permettant aux hautes pressions (anticyclone des Açores) de s’étendre à nouveau vers l’ouest du continent, et donc vers la France pour le week-end. Cela devrait assurer le retour d’un temps plus sec et calme durant au moins 4 jours. Prévision de l'évolution des anticyclones et dépressions sur l'Europe du jeudi 16 au lundi 23 février 2026 – Modèle européen via Meteociel Un temps calme s'imposant enfin plus durablement ? Il est difficile de prédire avec certitude. Si les modélisations de ces derniers jours suggéraient une tendance anticyclonique plus durable sur notre pays, les dernières simulations remettent en question cette hypothèse. Le courant océanique pourrait reprendre de la vigueur dès mercredi 25 février à la fin du mois. Prévision de l'évolution des anticyclones et dépressions sur l'Europe du lundi 23 février au lundi 2 mars 2026 – Modèle européen Cependant, certains scénarios envisagent une inversion de la situation et l'arrêt de ce courant perturbé océanique au début du mois de mars avec la formation d'un vaste anticyclone entre les Açores et la partie nord de l'Europe. Ceci annoncerait potentiellement le début d'une nouvelle accalmie beaucoup plus prolongée sur la France, mais il faudra attendre que la dépression qui viendra peut-être s'isoler sur le sud du pays disparaisse. Les tendances pour le mois de mars indiquent même un temps durablement sec. Bien que nous restions prudents, une telle évolution serait un contraste saisissant avec les conditions météorologiques récentes et une excellente nouvelle pour la gestion des crues et inondations. Si la majorité des modèles convergent vers cette prévision, il est essentiel de suivre l’évolution des prévisions dans les prochains jours, car les tendances peuvent changer à une échéance aussi lointaine.

Vague de froid du mois de février 1917 à Paris : Même les chevaux ne résistent pas ! archives meteo-paris.com Les deux derniers hivers de la Première Guerre mondiale sont particulièrement rudes en France, déjà en partie dévastée par trois années de combats. Entre le 20 janvier et le 15 février 1917, une vague de froid exceptionnelle frappe surtout le Nord et l’Est du pays, atteignant son apogée au début de février avec des températures extrêmement glaciales. Dans « Le Monde Illustré » du 3 février 1917, on note que cet hiver renoue avec la tradition, car selon le journal « les grands hivers d’antan deviennent de plus en plus rares… ». Il est vrai que la courbe de l’évolution des températures hivernales en France indique un réchauffement du début du siècle à l’arrivée de la Première Guerre mondiale. Des conditions météo insoutenables pour le moral des troupes Les sols gelés de l’Aisne, paradoxalement, permettent des mouvements de troupes impossibles sur sols boueux en temps normal. Cependant, l’armée française souffre terriblement du froid, étant nettement sous-équipée pour y résister, contrairement à l’armée allemande. Les régiments ne disposent que de quelques peaux de bête, et certains tirailleurs algériens sont même chaussés de souliers découverts et vêtus de culottes courtes. Ces conditions difficiles affectent grandement le moral des troupes. La relève sous la neige durant la guerre - début 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Jusqu’à -26°C dans les plaines et vallées de l'Est de la France ! Le froid atteint son point culminant au tout début du mois de février avec des températures glaciales : -26 °C à Bonneville, -23 °C à Commercy, -22 °C à Montbrison, -20 °C à Grenoble, -18 °C à Lyon, -17 °C à Alençon et Clermont-Ferrand, et -15,5 °C à Paris. Les dix premiers jours de février sont comparés à la situation de février 1895. A Paris, le déneigement des voies de circulation est très compliqué en raison du manque de main-d’œuvre. Les femmes sont alors réquisitionnées. Février 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Les rivières gèlent peu à peu Les rivières de l’Est commencent à geler le 24 janvier, tandis que celles du Nord, y compris celles de la région parisienne, le sont dans les derniers jours de janvier, un phénomène inédit depuis 1895. La navigation devient impossible sur les canaux puis sur la Seine. Parallèlement, la forte demande en charbon engendre d’importantes difficultés d’approvisionnement à Paris, comme à Londres. Malgré l’utilisation de quelques brise-glace et la construction de barrages pour retenir les glaces près de Rouen, les péniches restent bloquées entre Rouen et Paris. Un service spécial de transports automobiles est alors mis en place. Rouen - 7 février 1917 - archives meteo-paris.com Le prix du charbon s'envole !! Les files d’attente pour acheter du charbon s’allongent, et les prix s’envolent. Même les bourgeoises des beaux quartiers doivent attendre des heures, ce qui ne manque pas de provoquer quelques grincements de dents, tant figurés que réels. La pénurie de charbon, alors que de nombreuses machines en dépendaient à l’époque, a de plus en plus d’impact sur l’activité économique. Des lignes de tramway sont interrompues, des usines ferment leurs portes, et les blanchisseries, chauffées au coke, cessent progressivement leurs activités. Certains journaux s’indignent même que les prisonniers allemands soient mieux chauffés que les Français. La rareté du charbon entraîne une flambée des prix du bois de chauffage dans les grandes villes. Il est alors vendu au kilo, après avoir été scié et pesé sur des balances à main. Par ailleurs, les fourrures en peau de lapin deviennent très bon marché.

**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
Graves inondations dans le sud-ouest durant le mois de mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Le mois de mars 1930 est resté gravé dans les annales pour sa pluviométrie exceptionnelle dans le sud-ouest de la France, où des inondations d'ampleur historique avaient coûté la vie à plusieurs centaines de personnes ! Des crues d'ampleur dramatique Si les crues observées en ce mois de février 2026 sont majeures, celles survenues il y a un peu moins d'un siècle étaient encore plus spectaculaires. En effet, la fin de l'année 1929 se déroule sous un courant océanique persistant avec de nombreuses précipitations et cette tendance se poursuit au début de l'année 1930. Ainsi, les crues se multiplient sur le pays et atteignent leur apogée au mois de mars 1930, notamment dans les régions du sud-ouest. Les cours d'eau atteignent des niveaux records et les vastes plaines sont recouvertes par l'eau à perte de vue ! Ampleur remarquable des inondations dans le sud-ouest en mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Parmi les crues les plus remarquables, celle du Tarn marque véritablement les esprits. Du 1er au 4 mars 1930, le Tarn et ses affluents atteignent des niveaux et des débits historiques, se transformant en de véritables torrents ! Les communes traversées par ces cours d'eau subissent des crues d'ampleur exceptionnelle et la puissance du courant provoquer l'effondrement de nombreux bâtiments. Le village de Reyniès, sur la photo ci-dessous, est littéralement ravagé par la crue du Tarn ! Le village de Reyniès (82) ravagé par la crue du Tarn en mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Lourds dégâts et plus de 300 victimes ! Lorsque vient la décrue, on découvre des villes et villages ravagés par la puissance de cours d'eau devenus des torrents en furie. Dans le Tarn, la commune de Moissac a subi de lourds dégâts. De nombreux bâtiments qui bordaient le cours d'eau se sont effondrés. En plus des dégâts matériels considérables, le bilan humain est très lourd. Les crues ont emporté des dizaines de personnes, dont certaines ne seront jamais retrouvées. Lourds dégâts à Moissac (82) suite à la crue majeure du Tarn le 4 mars 1930 - Chronique Météo Villes Les crues de mars 1930 dans le sud-ouest font partie des plus meurtrières de l'histoire de France. On dénombre plus de 300 victimes, bien que le chiffre soit approximatif. Les habitations se sont effondrées par centaines, mettant à la rue environ 10.000 personnes ! Le Président de la République de l'époque, Gaston Doumergue, se déplace dans les zones sinistrées pour apporter son soutien aux populations traumatisées par la catastrophe.

### 16. `FR` [Vers le début d’une lente décrue](data/articles/a0ab6818820313c7eac6d402bf88039a.html)
**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
La décrue est en vue sur la France avec le retour de conditions bien plus sèches - Celle-ci s'annonce néanmoins lente dans certains secteurs. Images impressionnantes de la crue de la Charente à Saintes ce mercredi 18 février 2026, dont le niveau va continuer de grimper cette nuit et demain. (photos via EPTB Charente) La décrue s'amorce en cette fin de semaine Le temps se montre exceptionnellement perturbé et humide en France depuis maintenant plusieurs semaines. En conséquences, les crues sont nombreuses et parfois très importantes à travers le pays, notamment sur l'ouest et le sud-ouest de la France. Plusieurs tronçons sont d'ailleurs toujours placés en vigilance rouge par Vigicrues ce vendredi 20 février : - Les basses vallées angevines - La Loire aval - La Loire saumuroise - La Charente aval Sur ces secteurs, les niveaux des cours d'eau continuent d'augmenter en cette fin de semaine avant un pic de crue attendu ce week-end. À Saintes par exemple, la Charente devrait atteindre un pic dimanche 22 février autour de 6.60 m (record de 6.84 m en décembre 1982). Évolution du niveau de la Charente à Saintes du 8 au 22 février 2026 – Vigicrues Ce pic devrait être suivi d'une lente décrue sur ce secteur, comme sur la majorité des cours d'eau de l'ouest de la France. En effet, une poussée anticyclonique est observée dès ce vendredi sur la France, ce qui permettra le retour d'un temps plus calme et sec au moins jusqu'en milieu voire fin de semaine prochaine. Cumuls de précipitations attendus jusqu'au vendredi 27 février 2026 sur la France – Modèle GFS via meteociel Ce retour au sec devrait donc permettre aux niveaux des cours d'eau d'entamer une baisse plus ou moins marquée dès ce week-end et ce durant plusieurs jours, une bonne nouvelle pour les régions sinistrées. Une décrue qui s'annonce lente dans certains secteurs Toutefois, il ne faut pas s'attendre à un retour à la normal dès la semaine prochaine. La décrue s'annonce en effet lente à très lente sur la majorité des cours d'eau français. Il faut en effet attendre que toute l'eau des bassins versants s'évacue avant que les fleuves et rivières retrouvent des niveaux plus normaux, ce qui s'annonce long sachant que les sols sont complètement saturés d'eau sur la quasi-totalité du pays. Il est donc logique d'observer un temps de retard entre l'arrêt des pluies et le début de la décrue, le temps que la pluie tombée en amont des cours d'eau se propage en aval. Schéma d'explication d'un bassin versant – METEO-EXTREME À cela s'ajoute la fonte plus ou moins marquée du manteau neigeux attendue dans les prochains jours sur les reliefs. Cette période plus calme et sèche devrait en effet s'accompagner d'un regain de douceur printanière sur notre pays, que ce soit en basses couches mais également en montagne. Cette douceur devrait engendrer un début de fonte du manteau neigeux parfois exceptionnel présent sur nos reliefs. On relevait en effet souvent plus de 250 à 350 cm de neige en haute montagne du côté des Alpes ce 20 février, parfois 4 mètres du côté de l'Isère. Les Pyrénées sont également très enneigées avec en général 250 à 280 cm sur les sommets de la région. Ainsi, l'eau de fonte devrait donc de nouveau alimenter les cours d'eau et ainsi maintenir des niveaux assez hauts malgré l'arrêt des précipitations. La couche de neige dépasse les 250cm en haute montagne dans les Pyrénées en cette fin de semaine comme ici au col du Portalet - Via Twitter @CyNPirineos Enfin, il est important de noter que certains scénarios envisagent déjà le retour de l'influence océanique perturbée pour la fin de semaine prochaine avec des pluies de nouveau généralisées et des perturbations successives, ce qui pourrait engendrer une nouvelle hausse du niveau des cours d'eau. Cette tendance reste néanmoins incertaine et sera à confirmer dans les prochains jours.

Voiture écrasée par un arbre à Perpignan au passage de la tempête Nils ce jeudi 12 février 2026 - photo Arpy Cod La tempête Nils a frappé encore plus durement que prévu dans le sud-ouest de la France et jusqu'en Méditerranée. On a mesuré jusqu'à 180 km/h dans les Pyrénées-Orientales et une personne a perdu la vie dans les Landes. Jusqu'à 180 km/h : Nils encore plus forte que prévu ! Les services de Météo France avait anticipé la virulente de la tempête Nils, plaçant la Vendée et de nombreux départements du sud-ouest de la France ainsi que la Corse en vigilance orange tempête. Le département de l'Aude avait été placé en vigilance ROUGE dès mercredi après-midi. À la vue des rafales de vent encore plus importantes que prévu, l'alerte rouge a été étendue aux départements des Pyrénées-Orientales jeudi matin. Carte de vigilance en vigueur le matin du jeudi 12 février 2026 - Météo France Et pour cause, les rafales de vent enregistrées au passage de la tempête Nils ont dépassé la prévision ! Dans la nuit, le sud-ouest a subi des rafales remarquables avec 157 km/h au Cap Ferret sur le littoral aquitain ! Ces vents très violents ne se sont pas limités à la côte. Dans les terres, on a mesuré 132 km/h à Toulouse, 134 km/h à Tarbes, 136 km/h à Mont-de-Marsan et 145 km/h à Pau ! Le matin, Aude et Pyrénées-Orientales ont subi des vents remarquables avec 149 km/h à Perpignan, 158 km/h à Leucate et même jusqu'à 180 km/h à Caixas ! Bien souvent, il s'agit de la plus forte tempête dans ces régions depuis Klaus en 2009 ! La Corse fut aussi fortement affectée jusqu'à 185 km/h à Cagnano dans le Cap Corse ! Rafales maximales de la tempête Nils le jeudi 12 février 2026 - keraunos.org 1 victime et de gros dégâts Les vents particulièrement puissants ont causé de très nombreuses chutes d'arbres dans tout le sud-ouest de la France et près de la Méditerranée. De plus, les sols gorgés en eau ont rendu le déracinement des arbres plus aisé. En matinée du jeudi 12 février 2026, la circulation a été fortement perturbée sur de nombreux axes routiers, y compris sur l'A9 où plusieurs pins sont tombés sur les voies. Un poids lourd a percuté l'un d'eux, blessant légèrement son chauffeur. Plus tôt dans la nuit, un routier de 55 ans a perdu la vie dans les Landes, touché par la chute d'un arbre traversant son pare-brise. Poids lourd ayant percuté un pin tombé sur l'A9 à Lespignan (34) le matin du jeudi 12 février 2026 - photo SDIS34 L'intensité de cette tempête a surpris autant les habitants que les météorologues avec des rafales un ou deux crans au dessus des valeurs initialement prévues. Les chutes d'arbres se comptent par milliers dans le sud-ouest de la France, y compris dans les grandes villes. Celles-ci ont occasionné de très nombreuses pannes d'électricité.

### 18. `FR` [Vigilance neige pour dimanche, et pas seulement](data/articles/4456f69aadf69276bd5fdd6e788750d6.html)
**Source:** Météo-Paris | **Keyword:** `Local`
La neige du mardi 6 février 2018 au soir à Paris 9e (square Montholon) - archives meteo-paris.com Nous avons choisi de vous présenter des cartes précises d’épaisseur de neige prévue d’ici la fin du mois de février, non pas par démagogie (car nous sommes conscients que ces scénarios évolueront dans les prochains jours), mais pour illustrer la tendance qui se dessine pour la fin du mois. En effet, tous les modèles météorologiques prévoient au moins deux ou trois épisodes de neige en plaine, bien que les timings, les épaisseurs et les régions concernées varient d’un modèle à l’autre. Nous avons opté pour le scénario du modèle météorologique européen, car il sert de référence aux prévisions nationales, même s’il est loin d’être parfait. Neige de dimanche : éphémère avec des différences selon les prévisions Les chutes de neige de dimanche toucheront principalement les régions du Nord au Massif central, en matinée, avant de se décaler vers le nord-est l’après-midi. Depuis quelques heures la plupart des scénarios indiquent des épaisseurs plus importantes et suivent le modèle météo européen qui a toujours été plus neigeux que les autres. Les fourchettes basses des météo arpège, européen et Icône indiquent des épaisseurs comprises entre 0 et 3 cm. Simulation de l'épaisseur de neige prévue pour dimanche 15 février par le modèles météo ARPÈGE (français) - Meteociel En revanche, les fourchette hautes du modèle météo arôme indiquent 1 à 10/12 cm : presque rien dans les vallées (et peut-être seulement une neige ne tenant pas au sol dans Paris) et jusqu'à 10 cm sur certains plateaux. Cette possible grande différence sera liée à la température au moment où auront lieu les précipitations, car il fera entre 0 et +1°C. Il suffira donc de sortir de l'îlot de chaleur des agglomérations et de monter sur les plateaux à plus de 100 à 150 m d'altitude pour passer d'un paysage sans neige à un paysage très enneigé. Simulation de l'épaisseur de neige prévue pour dimanche 15 février par les modèles météo ARÔME (français) et européen - Meteociel Nouvelles possibilités de neige la semaine prochaine Cet épisode neigeux sera suivi d’un puissant redoux, mais temporaire. La semaine prochaine, la France se trouvera entre l’air doux au sud et l’air plus froid au nord, au cœur d’un puissant courant hésitant entre une influence océanique polaire et une influence océanique des Açores. Une nouvelle chute de neige pourrait avoir lieu au nord de la Seine mercredi matin, car une dépression pourrait circuler sur ces régions, apportant de la neige au nord de son centre. Samedi 21 ou dimanche 22, une descente froide pourrait également se produire, accompagnée d’une forte instabilité et de possibles averses de neige jusqu’en plaine, notamment entre le Massif central et les régions du nord-est. Plusieurs possibilité également pour la fin du mois Enfin, en milieu de semaine suivante (aux alentours de mercredi 25 ou jeudi 26 février), le courant océanique pourrait être particulièrement vigoureux, mais l’air froid resterait sur le nord de la France, avec des scénarios très neigeux au nord de la Seine. Selon le modèle météo Européen, les deux tiers de la France seraient sous la neige sur cette carte. Il s'agit ici d'un scénario assez isolé, mais qui mérite d'être signalé.

La neige est très abondante à Val d'Isère en Savoie actuellement ! - Photographie : Station Val d'Isère Même si la neige reste timide en plaine depuis le début du mois de janvier sur la France, le constat est tout autre en montagne. Avec le temps très humide et perturbé de ces dernières semaines, la neige se montre en effet particulièrement abondante sur la majorité de nos massifs, notamment en moyenne montagne où l'épaisseur est parfois impressionnante, même pour une mi-février. Nous vous proposons donc un petit tour de nos massifs. Enneigement MOYEN par massif en bas et en haut des pistes au vendredi 13 février 2026 - relevés Météo-France Voici la liste des stations de sports d'hiver les plus enneigées en haut des pistes (source : Meteo-France) : Piau Engaly : 350 cm La Rosière 1850 : 300 cm Puy Saint-Vincent : 279 cm Saint-François-Longchamp : 265 cm Bonneval sur Arc : 262 cm Flaine : 260 cm Alpe d’Huez : 255 cm Praloup : 255 cm Arêches-Beaufort : 240 cm Chamrousse : 237 cm Les 2 Alpes : 235 cm Alpes C'est sur la partie nord du massif que les quantités de neige sont les plus importantes en station en cette mi-février 2026. On relève en effet en général entre 90 et 110 cm de neige en bas des pistes de la Haute-Savoie au Queyras en passant par l'Isère, parfois plus comme au Grand-Bornand (74) à 1430m d'altitude où on mesure 155 cm de neige ce 13 février. Les quantités sont en général comprises entre 200 et 300 cm en haut des pistes, là aussi des valeurs particulièrement élevées. L'enneigement est exceptionnel à La Rosière (Savoie), ce vendredi 13 février 2026 - cliché Alexandra Brochard via @MeteoExpress Attention toutefois, ces quantités de neige particulièrement importantes entraînent un risque d'avalanche très élevé en cette fin de semaine. Plusieurs avalanches notables ont d'ailleurs été observées ce jeudi 12 février sur le nord des Alpes. Le sud du massif n'est pas non plus en reste avec là aussi des quantités notables. On mesure en général entre 40 et 60 cm de neige en bas des pistes dans les stations des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence et des Alpes-Maritimes et jusqu'à 200 cm sur les sommets. La nivôse de Millefonts (06) mesure par exemple 147 cm de neige à 2430 m d'altitude, soit 86 cm de plus que l'année dernière à la même période ! Pyrénées Le massif pyrénéen est également particulièrement concerné par les chutes de neige ces dernières semaines. Que ce soit l'est ou l'ouest du massif, toutes les stations observent d'importantes quantités de neige en cette mi-février 2026. Certains secteurs des Pyrénées-Orientales ont même relevé des quantités de neige qui n'avaient plus été vues depuis près de 30 ans et d'autres ont atteint des records au début du mois de février ! Si les quantités restent raisonnables en bas des pistes (entre 20 et 40 cm en général) en raison de plusieurs redoux plus ou moins notables depuis le début du mois de février, on relève le plus souvent 200 à 250 cm de neige sur les sommets ! Corse Comme pour les Pyrénées et les Alpes, le temps agité et très humide de ces dernières semaines a apporté une couche de neige particulièrement importante sur les massifs de l'île de beauté. Celle-ci est même plus importante que dans certains massifs alpins avec en général entre 30 et 50 cm à moyenne altitude et jusqu'à 250 cm sur sommets de la région, localement plus ! On relève par exemple 277 cm à la nivôse de Maniccia (2360m), 157 cm de plus que l'année dernière à la même date et presque 2 m de plus qu'en février 2024 ! La station de Bastelica dans le Val d'Ese a même pu rouvrir ses portes au début du mois de février après 3 ans sans neige ! Les autres massifs français sont malheureusement un peu moins bien fournis en terme de neige car moins élevés. L'air globalement assez doux pour la période a en effet limité les chutes de neige abondante sur le Jura, les Vosges et le Massif Central ces dernières semaines en plus de quelques journées de pluie jusqu'aux sommets de ces massifs, entraînant un lessivage parfois notable. On ne relève en général pas plus de 20-25 cm sur les sommets de ces reliefs, ce qui est à contrario déficitaire. Encore et toujours des chutes de neige en vue ! D'autres chutes de neige abondantes sont prévues d'ici la fin du mois (et notamment d'ici le 24 février) à tel point qu'il pourrait encore tomber 1 m à 2,50 m supplémentaires en haut des pistes, notamment sur le nord des Alpes et l'Ouest des Pyrénées ! Les épaisseurs pourraient ainsi atteindre localement 5 m voire davantage...

**Source:** France 24 (EN) | **Keyword:** `International`
The Committee to Protect Journalists published a report alleging the systematic abuse of Palestinian media workers in Israeli detention centers between 2023 and 2026. Through interviews with dozens of former detainees, the organization documented harrowing accounts of torture, starvation, and sexual violence aimed at silencing the press. The findings highlight that the majority of these journalists were held under administrative detention without formal charges or access to legal counsel. Evidence such as medical records and photographs supports claims of extreme weight loss and untreated injuries resulting from physical beatings. The advocacy group is now calling for international accountability and independent investigations into these alleged violations of humanitarian law. Despite these testimonies, the Israeli military maintains that it adheres to international standards and does not intentionally target members of the media.

Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he would raise a temporary tariff rate on US imports from all countries from 10% to 15%, less than 24 hours after the US supreme court ruled against the legality of his flagship trade policy.
Infuriated by the high court’s ruling on Friday that he had exceeded his authority and should have got congressional approval for the tariffs he introduced last year under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the US president railed against the justices who struck down his use of tariffs – calling them a “disgrace to the nation” – and ordered an immediate 10% tariff on all imports, in addition to any existing levies, under a separate law.

For years, she has sat as a judge at the international criminal court, weighing accusations of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity; now she is on the same list as terrorists and those involved in organised crime. “It really was a moment of a bit of disbelief,” she said.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware) RFID cards and tags are everywhere! We use them in buildings for access control. Printers and photocopiers can use them to identify staff members. Livestock tagging and pet identification tags all use a form of RFID. The tech to read an RFID device is cheap, for around $5 you can get the reader, and for $4, a Raspberry Pi Pico can read the IDs from the cards / tags.In this how to, we will learn how to read RFID tags and cards using an MFRC522 reader and a Raspberry Pi Pico, the goal will be to create a fictional RFID access control system that will allow users into a building, or alert security to remove them. Before we can do that, we need to identify the ID of our cards / tags. The first section of this how to will do just that, and then we will insert some code to control two LEDs to simulate the locking mechanism.For this how to you will needRaspberry Pi Pico running MicroPythonMFRC522 RFID readerLarge breadboard11 x Male to male jumper wiresGreen LEDRed LED2 x 100 Ohm resistors (Brown - Black - Brown - Gold)Building the Hardware (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The hardware build is split into two sections.

**Source:** IoT Business News | **Keyword:** `Business`
Key Insights (AI-assisted):
Tightening integration between intrinsically safe hardware and modern connectivity is shifting hazardous-area IoT from niche pilots to scalable deployments. As ATEX smartphones gain full cellular, GNSS, and sensor stacks, the bottleneck moves from device capability to interoperability with SCADA, MDM, and line-of-business applications. This forces OT and IT teams to converge architectures and security models, particularly on private LTE/5G. The trend reflects a broader move toward real-time, worker-centric IoT in brownfield industrial environments with stringent safety and regulatory constraints. Sensors, standards, and operational constraints in hazardous zones
A technician in a chemical plant needs to log temperature readings, check equipment vibration, and photograph a valve assembly. Standard procedure, but in a Zone 2 hazardous area, standard electronics won’t do. The risk isn’t the device itself – it’s what happens if a component fails and creates a spark, or if a surface gets hot enough to ignite surrounding gases.
Industrial IoT in petrochemical, mining, and pharmaceutical facilities comes down to collecting sensor data while ensuring equipment remains intrinsically safe.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple ships a simple but effective charging cable with the Apple Watch that will fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7 or later (Watch 8/9/10/11, Watch Ultra 1/2/3). You won’t find a faster charging accessory but you can also choose from a wide range of stylish and practical charging stands, docks and power banks for your Apple Watch—including some that can also charge other Apple devices such as your iPhone and AirPods.
Here, we round up the best Apple Watch chargers, docks and charging stands—some of which can charge your other Apple devices at the same time. Most should be compatible with all generations of the Watch, but be sure to check compatibility before buying.
See below the product chart for more on Apple Watch fast-charging, including the expected charging times of each Apple Watch.
There are simple charging cables, multi-device chargers that can power up your Apple Watch plus your iPhone and AirPods, chargers that are built for portability and travel, designer models that look great at home or in the office, and handy Apple Watch power banks.
While battery life has improved with the most recent Watch launches, particularly the Apple Watch 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3, you will still find yourself in need of recharging between one and two days.
We’ve tested a lot and selected our favorite Apple Watch chargers here.

Every Apple Watch comes with the company’s Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable. At $29 / £29 it’s not overly expensive to buy a spare or replacement, but there are more able multifunction Watch chargers available, as well as much cheaper simple cables that we would steer clear of but which we have investigated to see if we can find one we can recommend. First we start our best Apple Watch charger roundup with these simple models, and then we test the more functional and better-designed alternatives. Pros
Fast charge Watch

Apple ships its Watch Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable with its Watch Series 7 and later models, including the Watch Series 8/9/10/11, SE 3 and Watch Ultra. (Earlier Apple Watch SE models and Series 6 and earlier Watches shipped with the Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable that lacks the fast-charging function.)
Both charging cables are Apple white and a meter long. The latest version features an enhanced charging puck that also works with the case of the AirPods Pro 2 &amp; 3 and AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation.
The 7.5W Fast Charger Cable can charge 33% faster than the older 5W cable—charging a compatible Watch battery from 0-80% in just 45 minutes. An eight-minute charge will support eight hours of sleep tracking.
Without fast charge, it takes about 1.5 hours to charge an Apple Watch to 80%, and about 2.5 hours to 100%.
Fast charging requires at least a 20W USB-C charger, like you’d use to charge an iPhone; find our best iPhone chargers for a wider choice that the plain Apple 20W charger.
While you can still buy the older Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable, there’s little benefit as the newer Magnetic Fast Charger to USB-C Cable is backwards compatible with older Watch models, looks the same, and is the same price. You can use the old cable on a later Watch but obviously without fast charging. Pros

Apple’s official Watch Charger is fast and reliable but expensive compared to the knock-off Watch chargers you can find online. This is a shame as having a spare in your bag or lying around at home is useful given the Watch’s pretty dreadful battery life.
Usually there is a trusted third-party provider with an alternative to Apple’s simple charging cable but we could find none for the Apple Watch that were cheaper than the Apple version. We know that the Satechi USB-C Fast Charging Cable for Apple Watch is trustworthy as it’s from one of our favorite brands, but it’s actually pricier than the Apple—so why bother, unless you prefer the shorter cable?
There are some great third-party Apple Watch charging stands and adapters—many of which we review below. But you are taking a chance (albeit a very affordable chance) by picking a cheapo simple Watch charger from Amazon, Temu or other online retailers. We bought one from Amazon that frayed its cable sitting in a bag for a few weeks. If you must, then scan the user reviews but we can’t vouch that the good ones are genuine and others often state problems with durability and extremely slow charging. You spent a bunch on your Apple Watch so why risk it going up in flames by saving a few bucks on a spare charger? Pros

Small enough to fit in your pocket, this little 5W Watch charger from Satechi can plug straight into a USB-C charger or a USB-C charging port—for example, the Thunderbolt on your MacBook or iPad, a USB-C car charger, or USB-C output power bank.
As we all know, it’s not only the Apple Watch with a weak battery. This portable Watch Charger can also be used to charge AirPods in a compatible case.
When you get an alert telling you that your Watch battery is fading, you don’t always have your meter-long Apple charging cable with you but you are likely nearer a USB-C power point, and this little Watch charger can live at the bottom of your backpack for when you need it most. Pros

The Nimble Watch charging stand can fast-charge the Watch (Series 7 and later), and weighing just 3.2oz (91g) is portable, too. It is made from sustainable plant-based aloe leather.
The magnetic charging module allows the Watch to be raised to work either lying flat or in Nightstand mode. It ships with a separate 5-foot (1.5m) USB-C but requires a USB-C wall charger. Belkin An alternative is the larger (3.8 x 3.8 x 0.63 inches) and heavier (6.8oz) Belkin Boost Charge Pro Portable Fast Charger for Apple Watch, which is a long name for a fairly simple square, rubberized Apple Watch charging stand. It’s a little more expensive ($59.99), too, but it is available in white as well as black. Its built-in 4-foot (1.2m) USB-C cable wraps neatly around the underside of the dock, so keeping your space clutter-free. There’s a precision dial on the bottom of the dock to raise the puck height depending on the size of your Watch.
Alternatively, you can save money by buying one of the simple Apple Watch stands that require you to connect your Watch charging cable into the basic stand. Pros

It’s simple to use once you find a USB-C port on a wall charger, your MacBook or even your iPhone (15 or later), you can lie your Watch on the pad and soon enough juice should be in your Watch so you won’t miss any of those precious active minutes. Best 2-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone chargers
If you own an Apple Watch there is a high possibility that you also own an iPhone, so why not have one versatile charger that can power up both Apple devices at the same time. Here are some of the favorites we have tested. Pros

Colors: Aluminum
USB-C charger: 30W wall charger included
Twelve South has triumphed with this pocketable 2-in-1 charger that can handle iPhone and Apple Watch (or Watch and AirPods), charging the two devices simultaneously.
It is fully Apple certified, so fast wirelessly charges the Watch at 5W and the iPhone at 15W. The Watch can’t be charged faster, although you can find 25W wireless chargers for the iPhone.
But its wonder is its clever, dinky foldable size and MacBook-like styling. Unfurl the charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed. You can even fold 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nightstand mode. Flip it round, and you can set the iPhone in landscape StandBy mode.
It chips with a super-compact 30W USB-C wall charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads: US, UK, EU and AU/NZ.
The ButterFly is also our favorite Apple Watch travel charger, but it works back at base just as well. Twelve South You can buy a different (a little pricier at $99.99) version in six different colors—the Twelve South ButterFly SE uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe, so also charges at 15W, but doesn’t ship with a wall charger. Its not metal like the original Butterfly but at least with its color choices (Black, White, Pink, Coastal Blue, Iridescent, Midnight Plum) it resembles more a butterfly than a moth. Pros

USB-C charger: Not included (27W charger required)
Very similar to the Twelve South ButterFly, reviewed above, the Native Union Voyage is a touch larger but also a little lighter. In the same way, it’s a superb travel charger for iPhones after version 12 and Apple Watches. It can fast charge both as it uses 15W Qi2 for iPhone magnetic wireless charging (compared to the ButterFly’s 15W MagSafe but the same Qi2 standard as the ButterFly SE) and 5W for Apple Watch. AirPods can be charged on the Watch part depending on your charging needs.
It is so compact that it will easily fit in your pocket or get lost at the bottom of your backpack—the included pouch is handy in this regard, and something we hoped would be included with the ButterFly.
Like the ButterFly SE (but not the original ButterFly that ships with a 30W USB-C charger) it doesn’t come with a wall charger so you’ll need to add your own. And it is priced the same as the ButterFly SE.
It seems a shame to just compare this very neat 2-in-1 charger to the similar chargers that came before it. It does beat the Twelve South chargers in two respects. We think the Voyage will likely show less wear than the others as its silicone cover looks more hardy. And we like the fact you can just push out the Watch charging module from the back rather than risking your fingernail on the ButterFly’s notch.
Take a look at the Voyage and the ButterFly and ButterFly SE, and make your choice. You won’t be disappointed with any of these dinky and cleverly designed 2-in-1 chargers. Pros

The BoostCharge Pro looks rather like a paperweight and will delight interior designers.
Compact and low-level in an elegant organic shape, the bulb-like charging stand is made from at least 60% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic and has pleasingly soft edges and a texture that makes you stroke it longingly.
The chrome Watch-charging pad sticks out from the back of the stand, and can’t be folded in when not in use, as is possible with some compact multi-device chargers such as the Anker 3-in-1 Cube. It features fast wireless charging for both Watch and iPhone. While it lacks an AirPods charging module like the 3-in-1 charging stations reviewed here, you can charge the AirPods wireless charging case on the top when the charging pad is flat and not charging your iPhone.

Belkin created not one but two UltraCharge Pro Convertible chargers; see also the review below. Both fold up to create a pocketable charging pad and can be unfolded to make a viewing stand. Only this version—they’re both called the same thing so bear with me—can charge both iPhone and Watch when partially folded up.
While not as design-mag gorgeous as the BoostCharge Pro Charging Dock reviewed above, the super-portable UltraCharge Pro Convertible is a foldable compact design marvel nonetheless.
Belkin designates its 15W iPhone chargers as “BoostCharge” and its 25W models as “UltraCharge”. Both will charge the Apple Watch at the same 5W but owners of the iPhone 16 and 17 series will cut around 15 minutes off their charging time with the 25W variety. Pros

It’s got the same name and near identical functions and technical specification as the Belkin UltraCharge Pro Convertible reviewed above, so the choice is all yours and may come down to price. This slightly pricier version is classier with its chrome bar and maybe that’s why Apple chose to sell this model in its Store. It’s also a bit heavier, making the cheaper version better suited to travel.
As the Watch-charging module is folded away under the pad, you can’t charge your Watch while it’s in Pad mode as you can with its non-identical twin. Pros

We list this elegant charging stand as a 2-in-1 because it can charge two types of Apple device: the Apple Watch and AirPods. However, you could argue that it’s a 3-in-1 as it has dual Watch charging pads for families or offices with more than one Apple wearable and can therefore charge two separate devices at the same time.
For such households this charger will help eliminate the need for messy individual charging cables. Best 3-in-1 Apple Watch/iPhone/AirPod chargers
As well as owning an Apple Watch and iPhone, a fair few of us have further swelled Apple’s coffers by buying AirPods. These are the 3-in-1 chargers that we have tested and approve for simultaneously charging Apple Watch, Apple iPhone and Apple AirPods (with a wireless charging case). Pros

If you’ve got an Apple Watch, chances are you also own an iPhone and maybe a set of AirPods, too. Here’s where a charging station, which can power up all three devices simultaneously, becomes essential if you want to rid yourself of a snake’s nest of cables.
Previously, 3-in-1 chargers were limited to 15W wireless charging either via Apple’s MagSafe or Qi2. Apple’s own iPhone MagSafe Charger has alone been able to charge iPhone 16 and later at 25W. The new Qi2 25W standard, however, means you can get the fastest magnetic charging in a stand without needing to rig it with Apple’s charging puck. In our real-world tests using the iOS 26 beta on our iPhone 16 Pro, we saw actual charging times from 0 to 50 percent of 30-35 minutes, measurably faster than 15W MagSafe.
As with the 25W MagSafe, Qi2 25W requires at least an iPhone 16 running iOS 26 to hit the top wireless charging speed. It and this stand is backwards compatible with older iPhones going back to the iPhone 12 but is pegged back at Qi2’s older 15W limit for those iPhones.
Here we are just as interested in the UltraCharge Pro’s Apple Watch-charging prowess and this is as fast as it gets at 5W.
The base is wrapped in a beautifully soft-touch silicone, while the bar that holds the iPhone and Watch chargers look great in a shiny chrome finish. It’s not the highest stand, but the iPhone charging pad is highly adjustable— up to 70 degrees in portrait or landscape—so it can be angled as you desire. Pros

If you own an Apple Watch it’s a fair bet that you also have an iPhone, and, go on admit it, some AirPods, too—you’re well invested into the Apple ecosystem.
This 3-in-1 charging station from Journey has a tiltable MagSafe-certified pad (15W) for all iPhones 12/13/14/15, plus a Qi charger for AirPods that have a wireless charging case.
Important to us here, though, is the Apple Watch charger at the back, which can fast-charge your Apple wearable.
The Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, reviewed above, is similar and features a tiltable Watch charger at the front rather than the back. If you want a 3-in-1 fast charging stand in white, then pick this Journey stand or the OtterBox 3-in-1 reviewed below; if you prefer black, go for the Charcoal Belkin UltraCharge Pro.
There is a cheaper version, the Journey Trio 3-in-1 Charging Station, which features a handy detachable Watch charger that you can slip into your pocket and plug into a USB-C charger, including your MacBook, away from the base unit. While that is a neat feature (and might save you $40 on a standalone Watch adapter) the MagSafe pad is only compatible so charges the iPhone at 7.5W and the Watch charger is slower than the one featured on the Trio Ultra 3-in-1.

The first 3-in-1 device charger based on the fast MagSafe-like 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging tech, the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station not only boosts wireless charging speeds that match Apple’s MagSafe but wraps up everything into a solid, foldable and compact yet flexible design. Apple Watch fast charging is the cream on the top.
Foldable and super compact, the Anler MagGo Wireless Charging Station is a great portable option for your travels. The Watch-charging module neatly folds into the base of the charging station. It’s just as great as a permanent charger at home.
We also like Anker’s 3-in-1 Cube, reviewed below—but while it’s gorgeous, it is heavier than the MagGo and doesn’t feature Watch fast charging.
If you can live without the MagSafe wireless charging iPhone stand element, we are rather in love with another Apple Watch charger from the same company, which is also a power bank: the Anker MagGo 10K Power Bank For Apple Watch, reviewed below in our Best Apple Watch Power Banks reviews. Pros

Belkin’s Boost Up Charge Pro Wireless Charging Pad 3-in-1 charger (available at Apple) is the fastest way you can wirelessly charge both your Apple Watch and iPhone (12/13/14/15/16-series models), plus AirPods that come in a wireless charging case. It’s a flat pad so the iPhone charges lying down rather than visible as it would be on a stand.
It boasts both Watch fast charging (7.5W) and iPhone MagSafe fast charging (15W). The included 20W USB-C wall charger is a little underpowered if charging all three devices simultaneously. A 30W or 40W charger would better handle that situation.
The Watch can either lie flat or in Nightstand mode, but because the iPhone lies flat you can’t take advantage of iOS 17’s StandBy mode.

Matching the Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe in terms of charging speed, the OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station is a super-fast iPhone/Watch/AirPods charger with a small footprint—indeed, it’s a little smaller than its rival.
The charging points for iPhone and Apple Watch are fully certified—iPhone 15W and Watch 5W. At 5W, the lower Qi pad is slower than the Twelve South.
We prefer the HiRise 3 Deluxe for its tilting iPhone MagSafe pad and more flexible Watch module. But if the white color option fits your decor better than the black-only HiRise, the OtterBox 3-in-1 is a great choice. Best Apple Watch travel chargers

### 3. `EN` [Apple’s budget MacBook coming soon: What to expect](data/articles/d95e9934296ec3d2ee791238f40014c0.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple’s MacBook lineup could be in for a major shakeup. The company is reportedly planning on releasing a new, low-cost laptop that can compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops in the budget market. Such a laptop could bring the Mac to a whole new class of users.
The new MacBook may feature an aluminum design in playful colors, an A19 Pro chip, Ultra Retina XDR OLED display, fewer ports, and Apple’s C2 modem. This new, low-cost MacBook could be a very popular one, which means you’ll want to keep track of its developments. Well, look no further. This article will keep track of the rumors and reports of this upcoming product, as well as offer our perspective on the device, so keep an eye on this page for the latest. New A19 MacBook: Release date
March 4, 2026 – possible Apple is scheduled to host three “Apple Special Experiences” on March 4 in the U.S., U.K., and China. These sessions, which are expected to offer media hands-on time with new products, could provide the ideal setting for the budget MacBook’s debut.
Apple’s low-cost MacBook has been rumored for some time, with Apple leaker Jon Prosser describing a new colorful MacBook Air back in May 2021, that never materialised, but over the past year rumors have remerged suggesting that Apple does have something different coming. In June 2025, credible analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, indicated (in Chinese) that Apple would start production of the new low-cost MacBook at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025 or in the early stage of the first quarter of 2026. It’s worth emphasising that those dates refer to the manufacturing process rather than the announcement or shipping timeframe. If production began in October 2025 then it’s plausible that the budget MacBook will arrive in early 2026, potentially unveiled at a spring event, or in the run up to Apple’s March 4 ‘Experience’. In November, 2025, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning to release a “low-cost laptop to rival Chromebooks and Windows PCs” in the first half of 2026. He said it was currently in testing at Apple and “in early production with overseas suppliers.”
On February 8, 2026, Gurman reported that the low-cost MacBook will be available “in the first half of the year.” He did not offer any specifics. And then, on February 15, he wrote that Apple’s long-rumored low-cost MacBook is expected to arrive “as early as March,” with a design that defies its price tag. What will the new MacBook be called? MacBook (probably)
No reports have been made about the official name of the laptop, but you can assume it won’t be part of the MacBook Air line. It’s being referred to as the A18 or A19 Pro MacBook, based on the chip it could have. Apple could simply call it “MacBook,” reviving the name of the discontinued 12-inch MacBook that was targeted at a similar market. Apple last updated the MacBook in 2017.
Foundry New A19 MacBook: Design
Playful colors
Aluminum chassis (not plastic) According to Mark Gurman (in February 2026), Apple’s low-cost MacBook will have a design that defies its price tag. Apple’s goal with this laptop is to make it affordable compared to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, and one way to cut costs is to make a plastic case instead of an aluminum one. However, since Apple is working to make its products carbon-neutral, it’s doubtful that it would use plastic, preferring to use aluminum or some other recyclable or carbon-free material. Therefore, it is no surprise that the new MacBook, according to Gurman, will have an aluminum chassis. There will be a new manufacturing process “designed to be both faster and more cost-effective than the one used with Apple’s current laptops,” according to Gurman. Along with the aluminum shell, Gurman reports that the new MacBook will be available in “playful colors.”
The following colours are indicated: yellow, light green, blue, silver, dark gray, and pink. Which, in the case of yellow, green and blue, does seem to match the logo Apple designed for the invites to the special events on March 4. Apple Back in June 2023 analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested the following colors: silver, blue, pink, and yellow. A19 Pro MacBook: Display
12.9-inch display – rumored
Apple currently uses a Liquid Retina (LED-backlit display with IPS technology) display in the MacBook Air, an upgrade over the original Retina displays Apple last used with the 13-inch MacBook Pro in 2022. It’s possible Apple could revert to a Retina display with squared-off corners for the A19 Pro MacBook, though it’s more likely that Apple shaves cost by using a smaller display.
On August 11, DigiTimes reported that the laptop will have a 12.9-inch display, slightly smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air. New A19 MacBook: Processor
iPhone chip: A19 Pro or A18 Pro – expected
Another way to meet the pricing goals for this new MacBook is to use a chip that isn’t as robust as the chips used in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. When Kuo first discussed the budget MacBook in his June 2025 report, he stated that Apple will use an A18 Pro, the same chip that was in the iPhone 16 Pro. Now that the A19 arrived with the iPhone 17 this is probably the more likely chip. about what the iPhone 17 can tell us about the MacBook that could use the same chip in: Is Apple’s rumored cheap MacBook hiding in plain sight? The A-series chips are used in iPhones, while M-series chips are in Macs. Both chip families are based on the same general architecture, but the M chips generally offer more processing power.
An A19 Pro (and A18 Pro) can technically do everything an M-series chip can, but it will be slower. When comparing Geekbench 6 benchmarks, the A18 Pro offered single-core performance that’s on par with the M3. However, because the A18 Pro has only 6 CPU cores, its multi-core performance is slightly behind the M1, which has 8 CPU cores. If Apple keeps everything the same, an A18 Pro MacBook will perform like an M1 MacBook Air, which, for a lot of people, has more than enough processing power. Should Apple use an A19 Pro we can expect something even better. It will draw comparison with the iPad models that are powered by Mac chips, though. MacRumors reported, in December 2025, that references to an A18 Pro MacBook appeared in a set of leaked Apple files.
New A19 MacBook: Connectivity
Apple is using its own wireless networking chip, the N1 in the iPhone 17, bringing Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 7, and Thread. It’s likely the same chips will make their way into the A19 Pro MacBook. There’s also a chance this new Mac will have cellular connectivity using Apple’s C1, C1X or yet to launch C2 modem. The C2 is likely to support mmWave. Aside from this, it’s rumored that the budget MacBook will have fewer USB ports than the MacBook Air (which has two USB-C and a magsafe charging port). This low-cost MacBook may not support Thunderbolt. New A19 MacBook: Camera
No camera?
It’s also possible that Apple opts not to include a built-in camera. Over the past several years, Apple has promoted the Mac’s Continuity Camera feature that lets you use an iPhone as a Mac webcam, as well as the upcoming macOS Tahoe Magnifier app. Apple could promote this as a webcam solution. This would be a drastic change, since it’s been a long time since Apple shipped a laptop without a camera, but it could be a possibility in order to meet the company’s price goal. New A19 MacBook: Performance Results are expressed as Geekbench scores. Higher scores/longer bars are faster. We don’t yet have the benchmarks for the A19 Pro, but the A18 Pro has 8GB of RAM, which Apple has said is the bare minimum required to run Apple Intelligence features. So, this new laptop will have at least 8GB of RAM and possibly 16GB, like the other MacBook models. Since the iPhone doesn’t offer RAM upgrades, we don’t know what Apple could charge for extra memory.
As for graphics performance, the A18 Pro has a 6-core GPU, and its Metal score in Geekbench 6’s Compute benchmark is similar to that of the M1 found in the MacBook Air. It’s not a cutting-edge performer, but it’ll handle everyday tasks without any issues. Since Apple’s other MacBooks all start at 256GB of storage, it’s nearly certain this model will come with 256GB of storage as well. New A19 MacBook: Price
The cheapest laptop Apple sells is the $999 MacBook Air. However, Walmart still sells the M1 MacBook Air with a 256GB SSD for $649 and as low as $599. The A19 Pro MacBook has been thought of as a replacement for this Walmart model, though it’s hard to believe it would be that cheap. A price that falls between $729 and $849 seems like it would fit into the MacBook lineup.
There are claims that the low-cost MacBook could start at $599, which could allow Apple to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops. Gurman reports that the new laptop will cost “well under $1,000.”
Our estimation would be around the middle of those two figures, around $749. @macworld.com A cheap MacBook…or something else. A rumor says that Apple is going to release a cheap laptop, but what if it’s actually the long-rumored iPad/Mac hybrid we’ve heard about?

### 4. `EN` [Apple's Low-Cost Colorful MacBook: All the Rumors](data/articles/fc9b97747ef78e866a45b8045bc669e9.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple has been developing a more affordable version of the MacBook, and it's rumored to be launching in under two weeks. This is going to be one of Apple's most unique Macs, because there hasn't really been anything quite like it before. We've rounded up everything we know about the low-cost MacBook ahead of its March debut. Design Rumors about the MacBook's design make it sound a lot like the MacBook Air. It will have an aluminum chassis in various colors, and a 12.9-inch or 13-inch display, depending on the rumor. It's possible the low-cost MacBook will have a thin and light design because it's going to use a lower power A-series chip that doesn't require a lot of heat dissipation, but that's not yet confirmed. Apple used to have a 12-inch MacBook with a thin design and a low-power Core M chip, and it's been suggested that this new MacBook could be something of a revival of that machine. Thinner and lighter typically means more expensive with Apple products, so a super slim design might not be what Apple is optimizing for. Making the low-cost MacBook thinner than the ‌MacBook Air‌ could just confuse the MacBook lineup. iPad, Apple keeps the price down by using older display technology that's not as thin, so we could see that same strategy with the low-cost MacBook. A thicker chassis and a super efficient chip could mean a long battery life, which would be ideal for an educational environment. Colors The MacBook is going to come in a selection of fun colors, and Apple has tested light yellow, light green, blue, pink, silver, and dark gray, according to Bloomberg. Not all of those colors are likely to ship, but it sounds like we'll get at least four of them. Ming-Chi Kuo thinks the MacBook will come in yellow, silver, blue, and pink, which would be the same colors that Apple offers for the ‌iPad‌. A-Series Chip The most consistent rumor we've heard about the MacBook is its planned chip. Rather than an M-series Mac chip, Apple is planning to use an A-series chip. The low-cost MacBook is expected to use the A18 Pro chip, which Apple first debuted in the iPhone 16 Pro. The A18 Pro uses a second-generation 3-nanometer process. It has a 6-core CPU with four performance cores and two efficiency cores, along with a 6-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine for AI-based tasks. In Geekbench benchmarks, the A18 Pro has an average single-core score of 3451, and a multi-core score of 8572. For comparison, the M4 iPad Pro earns a single-core score of 3694 and a multi-core score of 13732 (Apple's next ‌MacBook Air‌ is going to use the M4 chip). M1, which is the chip that Apple kept around in a lower-cost version of the ‌MacBook Air‌ for several years. An A18 MacBook wouldn't be too far off from the M4 Mac/‌iPad‌ chips in terms of single-core performance, but there would be a difference in multi-core performance. iPhone or ‌iPad‌ can do. Apple is developing the low-cost MacBook with students in mind, and it sounds like it will be the Apple equivalent of the affordable Chromebook PCs that are often used by students. RAM Macs start with 16GB RAM, but the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro has 8GB RAM, the minimum for Apple Intelligence. We can expect an A18 Pro MacBook to have at least 8GB RAM so it can support ‌Apple Intelligence‌, but it's possible Apple will give it the 16GB that all Macs have. Storage The ‌MacBook Air‌ starts with 256GB of storage, but Apple could possibly launch the low-cost MacBook with 128GB. Ports The A18 Pro chip in the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models doesn't support Thunderbolt, so the MacBook will be limited to USB-C (10GB/s) and won't offer Thunderbolt speeds. That will limit display connectivity, so it's likely the A18 Pro MacBook will only support a single external display. Naming It's not really clear what Apple will name the low-cost Mac notebook. We have the ‌MacBook Air‌ and the MacBook Pro, so it's entirely possible it will be called "MacBook." Apple has used the MacBook name multiple times in the past, and it's not in use at the moment. Price Pricing on the ‌MacBook Air‌ starts at $999, and the low-cost MacBook is expected to be priced much lower. iPad Air with M2 chip starts at $599. A price between $599 and $799 could make the most sense because it wouldn't be as expensive as the ‌MacBook Air‌ or ‌iPad Pro‌, but would come in at or just over the ‌iPad Air‌'s cost. iPhone 16e, Apple's most affordable ‌iPhone‌ that uses a slightly less powerful A18 chip. Launch Date Rumors suggest that the low-cost MacBook will be introduced at or just before Apple's March 4 Special Experience that's taking place in New York, London, and Shanghai. Apple could announce the MacBook in a press release ahead of the experience. This article, "Apple's Low-Cost Colorful MacBook: All the Rumors" first appeared on MacRumors.com

### 5. `EN` [Jony Ive's First OpenAI Device Will Be Smart Speaker With Camera, 2027 Launch Planned](data/articles/08d3b6bcfa2aee6f387501ba33f05eea.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
OpenAI is working on several AI hardware devices in partnership with former Apple designer Jony Ive, and the first product that comes out could be a smart speaker. The company is developing a smart speaker, a smart lamp, and considering AI glasses, according to The Information, with the speaker set to come out in early 2027. OpenAI's smart speaker has an integrated camera and it is designed to learn information about who is using it and what's around them. It will include a facial recognition feature similar to Face ID, and users will be able to use the speaker to make purchases. The speaker will have AI integration, so users can ask it questions and make requests. In an internal presentation, OpenAI employees were told that the speaker would observe users and suggest actions to help them achieve goals, such as suggesting an early bedtime ahead of a morning meeting. Siri that Apple is developing. OpenAI is planning to price the speaker between $200 and $300, with a launch planned for February 2027 at the earliest. OpenAI is exploring a smart lamp and smart glasses, but those products won't be ready until 2028 or later. With the exception of the speaker, OpenAI's hardware development is in the early stages and other products could be canceled. acquired Ive's hardware firm io in May 2025. Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have shared some details on their AI hardware work, suggesting that there was an established prototype in November 2025. At the time, Ive and Altman said the device would be "peaceful" and an "active participant" that's not annoying. The duo also described the device as a product that would "make people feel joy." an employee meeting, where Ive and Altman said they didn't want a device with a screen. The device, which is presumably the speaker that The Information says is in development, was described as pocket-sized and contextually aware of the user's surroundings.

### 6. `EN` [Three Upcoming Apple Products Seemingly Spotted in macOS 26.3 Code](data/articles/f6d7f751de0129aef3b63f5199489c5f.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
macOS 26.3 hints at Apple's rumored lower-cost MacBook, and two new Studio Display models, according to Macworld's Filipe Espósito. Espósito found the following codenames within macOS 26.3's source code, and he revealed the upcoming products that they likely correspond with, based on previous reporting from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and others. J700: Lower-cost MacBook J427: A new Studio Display J527: A new, higher-end Studio Display
This is far from the first time that these codenames have been spotted in Apple's software updates. According to MacRumors contributor Aaron Perris, the codenames were also present in updates such as macOS 26.2 and iOS 18.5 last year. more and more hints stack up, it is clear that all three products are inching closer to release. in the first week of March. The media would then receive hands-on time with the laptop during the "Apple Experience" in New York, London, and Shanghai on Wednesday, March 4 at 9 a.m. Eastern Time. in the first half of 2026, but it is unclear if they will be part of the announcements in the first week of March. The lower-cost MacBook is rumored to be powered by a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip, rather than an M-series chip. The laptop will apparently be available in a variety of bright colors, such as yellow, green, blue, and/or pink. Other rumored specs include a 12.9-inch display and 8GB of RAM. The starting price remains to be seen, with estimates ranging from $599 to $799 in the United States. from 2015 to 2019. 27-inch screen with mini-LED backlighting, up to a 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support, and an A19 chip or A19 Pro chip. No major design changes are expected. If the next Studio Display receives mini-LED backlighting and HDR support, its maximum brightness and contrast ratio would be higher than the current model. And a newer A19 or A19 Pro chip — up from the A13 Bionic currently — should contribute to performance improvements, camera-related enhancements, and more. There are no details about the second Studio Display. Presumably, it would be a higher-end model, and we can only dream of a larger 32-inch screen size.

### 8. `EN` [Dwindling M1 Air stock points to imminent release of a budget MacBook](data/articles/d2c060d95e8fb76ecb302498f10e357f.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple’s long-rumored cheap MacBook appears to have come a step closer to launch, with the discovery that Walmart has stopped selling new units of the low-cost M1 MacBook Air.
As first reported by PC Mag, searching for the late-2020 machine on the U.S. site with the “new” filter checked brings up three buying options: the 256GB in Space Gray or gold, and a listing for the 512GB model, which hasn’t been available since 2024. All three now show as out of stock for shipping, and the reporter was able to find just one store in his local area with units for pickup. I had a similar experience. I’m out of luck, and they’re out of stock.
David Price / Foundry (As a side note, I’ve been unable to find new units of the M1 Air in any other stores close to me, including Amazon. If you check the price-comparison table below, you’ll see if there are any in your location. If the table isn’t showing up at all, that means you’re out of luck, too.)
Retailer Price Check Product Price It isn’t clear how long Walmart has been short of stock for this machine, but we know it was on sale for the bargain price of $549 as recently as mid-December. As it’s unlikely that Walmart just happened to run out of stock after two years, it seems Apple and Walmart have decided to wind down sales.
While the decision could be related to cost-cutting measures due to memory prices ballooning, this timing adds credence to the rumors of a cheap MacBook expected within the next two weeks. Apple recently announced global “experiences” on March 4, and it’s widely rumored that it will announce a series of new entries in its iPhone, iPad, and MacBook lines in the days leading up to that. Rumors about the new MacBook claim it will use an A18 Pro iPhone chip and cost around $699, both reasons to stop selling these M1 models. Whatever the truth, we should find out soon.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple tested color options for the 2022 MacBook Air redesign that are said to be similar to the finishes planned for its forthcoming low-cost MacBook, according to a Chinese leaker. Apple is expected to announce its rumored low-cost MacBook at an event on March 4, with the device coming in a selection of bold color options that are believed to include yellow, green, and blue – as seen on Apple's invite graphic. Instant Digital" says Apple originally planned to offer the same kind of light, playful color scheme for the MacBook Air with M2 chip. October 2021, a proven leaker claimed the redesigned MacBook Air would come in color options that are similar to the 24-inch iMac, but it didn't happen. The model eventually dropped in July 2022 in silver, starlight, space gray, and midnight colors. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said the colors Apple has tested for its budget MacBook so far include light yellow, light green, blue, pink, classic silver, and dark gray, although he says it's unlikely all of them will ship. If the colorful palette is unveiled, it would make the budget MacBook the most colorful laptop Apple has offered since the iBook G3 era in the late 90s. Apple offered the machines in Tangerine, Blueberry, Indigo, Graphite, and Key Lime. Ming-Chi Kuo, the low-cost machine will retail for well under $1,000 and run an iPhone chip – potentially the A18 Pro – rather than an M-series processor. It will feature a slightly-under-13-inch display and an aluminum chassis, which is being built using a new, faster manufacturing process that Apple developed to keep costs down, according to Gurman. announced a "special Apple Experience" for the media in New York, London, and Shanghai, taking place on March 4, 2026 at 9:00am ET, when we're hoping to get a glimpse of the new machine.

### 12. `EN` [The retro iPod that never was](data/articles/7596b7a99f42abd5625ff7c4f100b0f7.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple is known for being secretive about what goes on inside its offices, whether it’s about upcoming products or things from the past. Still, from time to time, we get a glimpse into internal projects that were never meant to see the light of day. What if we told you that Apple once considered launching a “retro iPod”?
Thanks to newly published material by former Apple designer Jon Stoa, we now have a fascinating glimpse into never-before-seen marketing concepts. They not only show scrapped plans for the 2007 iPhone launch, but also concepts for what would have been a special edition iPod classic.
An iPod inspired by the 1984 Macintosh
On his resume webpage, which includes several images for ads, packaging elements, and marketing images created while working at Apple, Stoa shares some of the unreleased projects he worked on at Apple between 2006 and 2008. The most intriguing is the concept for a limited edition “retro iPod,” which would be designed to look like it came straight out of 1984.
The idea was heavily based on a growing trend of nostalgia, even 20 years ago. The material imagines an iPod based on the design of the original Macintosh with a beige finish, classic typography, and the rainbow Apple logo on the back. He writes that the device “would draw from both the present and the past to make a statement about the role of Apple and the iPod in culture, both now and then.” Apple proposed a series of names for its retro “1984” iPod. Jon Stoa Suggested names included iPod retro, iPod rewind, iPod beta, and iPod backspace, all rendered in Apple Garamond, the typography used in Apple’s marketing materials at the time.
The concept went far beyond a vintage design. The marketing material proposed preloading the iPod with some music videos from the 1980s and even classic arcade games such as Pac-Man. Distribution would have been limited, with the retro iPod only available at Apple Stores and selected boutique partners.
There’s no evidence Apple ever developed prototypes for the retro iPod. The materials appear to be unused design and marketing explorations rather than a cancelled product.
Still, the fact that someone inside Apple considered making a vintage edition of the iPod (which was at its peak in 2006) is fascinating. A retro iPod is unlikely to happen now, but it would make an intriguing device. Jon Stoa Could a retro iPod happen in 2026?
Apple officially killed the iPod brand in 2022 when it discontinued the iPod touch, but the more classic iPod nano and iPod shuffle disappeared years earlier. Even so, some people are still calling for the return of the iPod in some form.
Some fans would instantly buy an iPod classic, while others would like a reimagined version of the iPod that blends today’s technologies with the essence of the original iPod.
If Apple were to revisit the idea today, it likely wouldn’t be a straight reissue. Instead, we could imagine a compact device the size of the iPod classic, but built with today’s materials and components. A modern OLED or mini-LED display, haptic feedback to simulate the tactile feel of the Click Wheel, expanded storage options, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support, and deep integration with Apple Music.
Whether Apple would embrace this idea of looking back at its hardware is another question. The company typically prefers to move forward and rarely celebrates milestones such as product anniversaries. But it’s hard to imagine a limited-edition device like this not selling out instantly. The Apple Store cube on 5th Avenue in New York City could have had a light projection show ahead of the iPhone’s launch. Jon Stoa The canceled iPhone event
Stoa’s material also sheds light on Apple’s pre-launch strategy for the original iPhone.
According to the documents, Apple had considered hosting another press event on June 26, 2007, just three days before the iPhone officially went on sale. The event was to be held at The California Theatre in San Jose. Attendees would have received an iPhone-shaped gift card to spend on the iTunes Store.
However, the event never happened.

### 13. `EN` [M1 MacBook Air Out of Stock at Walmart as Lower-Cost MacBook Nears](data/articles/f8e2c7036676364c394861e8753689ed.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple's older MacBook Air with the M1 chip is now out of stock on Walmart's website in the U.S., amid rumors of a new lower-cost MacBook coming soon. A colorful MacBook (concept) Walmart first began selling the MacBook Air with the M1 chip for $699 in March 2024. The price later dropped to $649, then to $599, and briefly to as low as $549 during a Black Friday sale last year. However, we just noticed that it has been out of stock for a while now, and there is no indication if it will ever be returning. Apple first released the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020, as one of the first Macs with an Apple silicon chip, instead of an Intel processor. The configuration being sold by Walmart for as low as $549 included 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. They were new-in-box units, not refurbished or open-box models. Walmart's website continues to offer refurbished units from "trusted sellers" for as low as $449. discontinued the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in 2024, after it launched models with the M3 chip, and it has since updated the MacBook Air with the M4 chip. Prior to being discontinued, the model with the M1 chip was being sold for a starting price of $999 brand new, but Amazon sometimes offered it on sale for $749 to $899. The laptop going out of stock at Walmart could be a hint. plans to release a lower-priced MacBook with a version of the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip as early as the first week of March, according to several reports and leakers. This would be an all-new model positioned below the MacBook Air in the Mac lineup, and it would mark a revival of the "MacBook" brand (with no "Air" or "Pro" designation). green, blue, pink, and/or yellow. A few rumors have specifically said it will have a 12.9-inch screen. discontinued 12-inch MacBook, including an ultra-thin and lightweight design. However, that model was powered by Intel processors. Apple stopped selling the 12-inch MacBook in July 2019, so there has been a long wait for a similar model powered by Apple silicon. In the iPhone 16 Pro, the A18 Pro chip has a 6-core CPU and a 6-core GPU. The chip's multi-core performance is similar to the M1 chip, so this new MacBook could effectively be a replacement for the MacBook Air with the M1 chip, and that could explain why it is finally out of stock at Walmart ahead of the lower-cost MacBook launching. Skyrocketing DRAM and NAND storage chip prices may have been a factor too, though. Related Roundup: MacBook Air

### 15. `EN` [No, Apple won’t drop USB-C from the iPhone 18](data/articles/35940d125bc3496954dcdb09c3e96172.html)
**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Most iPhone fans are currently focused on the imminent launch of the iPhone 17e, which could be here in a matter of days. But one dubious rumor doing the rounds on social media right now concerns a flagship phone from the next generation. It’s just a shame that it’s almost certainly wrong.
This TikTok video, which at the time of writing has been viewed more than 17 million times, purports to show the charging port of the iPhone 18. (Or “iPhone18,” as it’s labelled by the clearly knowledgeable maker.) But rather than the USB-C port, which has been used on all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 15 in 2023, the animation shows something more akin to the MagSafe connector that appears on newer MacBooks. This video might look cool, but it’s not going to happen. TikTok The charging cable, which has a rather nice black braided cord, attaches via a magnetic connection. When it’s in place a green LED lights up on the charger head, and a small green lightning bolt is shown at the bottom of the previously blank phone screen. (Never mind that iPhones don’t behave like this; it’s the least of our worries.) It looks very similar to the MagSafe cable on my 2021 MacBook Pro, except with three pins instead of five and a chunkier body.
Now, the video doesn’t list its sources; we don’t get the usual “supply-chain sources” or “people with knowledge of the matter.” It’s just an animation. So in some ways it’s quite difficult to refute: where did this information come from? Who said this was likely? Is this simply a concept that an illustrator dreamed up, like this animation from the same channel showing possible iPhone 18 Pro colors?
Whatever the video’s intention, it’s getting major traction from viewers who think it’s real. A quick browse through a handful of the 9,700-odd reveals viewer after viewer complaining about Apple’s foolishness in doing this, or the impracticality of the design. A few appear to be Android fans mocking iPhone users for their misfortune. I couldn’t find any pointing out that this is extraordinarily unlikely to happen.
Because, as several commenters argue, it wouldn’t be a practical solution. It would disconnect very easily, and unlike on the MacBook, disconnecting easily isn’t necessary to protect it from a specific type of accident. It would annoy customers and accessories makers. And it could create problems with the EU, who mandated USB-C connectors on all smartphones sold in its territory.
What may have happened is that someone has got confused between MagSafe on the iPhone and MagSafe on the Mac. They’re both charging standards that use a magnetic connection to keep the charging points in place, but in most other respects they’re totally different. (For example, the phone’s magnetic connection is stronger so that it remains connected if you nudge the device, whereas the laptop is designed to detach if you trip on the wire.) The iPhone 17 already has the phone version of MagSafe, and the iPhone 18 will too, but that doesn’t mean it will have the Mac version as well. If nothing else, it would be enormously confusing.
Whereas the iPhone 17e is expected to be here in time for Apple’s “experience” on March 4, the first 18-series iPhones won’t arrive until September. And the actual iPhone 18, the cheaper baseline model, might not turn up until the following spring. So bookmark our iPhone 18 superguide to keep up with all the latest news and rumors.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
A reported hardware failure affecting Apple's new in-house C1X 5G modem in the iPhone Air has surfaced online, marking the first known real-world incident involving the company's own baseband technology. The ‌iPhone Air‌ is the first iPhone model to ship with the Apple's internally designed C1X 5G modem, replacing Qualcomm's X75 modem used across the iPhone 16 lineup. The transition to Apple-designed modems follows years of development after Apple acquired Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019 and began building its own baseband engineering teams and intellectual property portfolio with the goal of reducing reliance on Qualcomm and increasing efficiency. support thread on Reddit spotted by Wccftech, where the user "itstheskylion" described waking up to find the device had completely lost cellular reception. According to the user, the phone displayed no signal bars and diagnostics indicated a hardware-level cellular problem. The device had reportedly been kept in a case since purchase and showed no signs of physical damage. The user said that multiple troubleshooting steps were attempted, including restarting the device, performing a soft reset, and resetting network settings, but none restored cellular connectivity. The user also reported using a dual-SIM configuration with two different carriers, with neither connection functioning, which suggests the issue was not related to a carrier outage or network-specific disruption. Baseband hardware failures are uncommon in modern smartphones due to extensive factory testing and validation processes, but large-scale production inevitably includes a small percentage of defective units. Apple has historically replaced and collected devices that exhibit unusual behavior for internal analysis, particularly when new technologies are involved. At present, there is no evidence that the issue is widespread or indicative of a broader reliability concern. iPhone 18 Pro, ‌iPhone 18‌ Pro Max, and foldable ‌iPhone‌ are rumored to feature Apple's next-generation C2 modem.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple launched a new series of iPhones at the end of 2025: the iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, as well as a brand new iPhone Air, but there was no new iPhone 17e for those hoping for an update to the budget iPhone.
This wasn’t a surprise: Apple released the iPhone 16e in February 2025 to replace the iPhone SE, so an update to the iPhone “e” series phones wasn’t expected to arrive until early 2026.

March 4 launch – possible The iPhone 16e arrived on February 19, 2025, so there was some hope that Apple could introduce its replacement on February 19 a year later… With that date now here it’s looking unlikely. However, there is an “Apple Special Experience” coming up on March 4, 2026, with media being invited to meet Apple execs in at least three global locations. It’s generally thought these meetings will tie to new Apple product launches. There are a number of other new product launches expected including a refreshed iPad Air, new entry-level iPad, M5 MacBook Air, M5 Pro/MaxMacBook Pro, and a brand new low cost MacBook.
An event on March 4 – even if Apple isn’t referring to it as an event – is good timing for Apple to launch the new iPhone 17e because it is right in the middle of the Mobile World Congress. According to various reports, the iPhone 17e has entered test production runs to prepare it for a spring 2026 release.
A rumor in early January said the iPhone 17e will go into production following CES (which ended January 9). This is unsurprising, as it follows the same pattern as the iPhone 16e. iPhone 17e: Specs: What’s new for the iPhone 17e
A19 with one fewer GPU than iPhone 17 – likely
MagSafe support – likely
C1X modem – possible
256GB SSD – possible
Apple’s decision to introduce the iPhone 16e in February 2025 represented a significant shift in its product strategy, moving away from the sporadic release cycle of the iPhone SE toward a more predictable, annual “e-series” lineup. This transition was driven by several strategic imperatives, ranging from the necessity of supporting new AI technologies to the desire to test in-house hardware components in a lower-risk environment. To maintain a starting price of $599 while including the high-end A18 chip, Apple made several calculated omissions that differentiate the 16e from the standard iPhone 16. The iPhone 17e is expected to address some of the shortcomings of the iPhone 16e with a few key design refinements (a Dynamic Island is rumored), more storage at the entry-level, MagSafe support and an updated processor (the A19).
Processor: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and others have reported that the iPhone 17e will have an A19 chip, which is no real surprise. If this is the case, it may be a slightly less powerful than the A19 chip used by the iPhone 17. Apple uses binned chips in the “e” series, so Tte A18 in the iPhone 16e has one fewer GPU core than the A18 in the standard iPhone 16; and the A19 in the iPhone 17e will likely have one fewer GPU core than the iPhone 17.
MagSafe: A December 2025 report in The Information claimed that Apple will add MagSafe support to the iPhone 17e, one of the features that is notably missing from the 16e. When we reviewed the 16e, the lack of MagSafe was one of its major shortcomings. A Macworld source in February 2026 claimed that the iPhone 17e will feature 25W MagSafe wireless charging.
Modem: Apple’s C1 modem first appeared in the iPhone 16e, and rumors suggest the iPhone 17e will use the same modem. However, it could take the newer C1X modem as found in the iPhone 17 series, which is apparently two times faster than the C1 while using 30% less energy.
Storage: There are suggestions that the iPhone 17e could follow the iPhone 17 with 256GB at the starting point, up from 128GB. However, in February 2026 Apple leaker, John Prosser said he expects the baseline storage to stay at 128GB. iPhone 17e: How the iPhone 17e display will be different
Dynamic Island instead of notch – possible Notch vs Dynamic Island.
David Price / Foundry Screen size: The iPhone 17 has a 6.3-inch screen, which is larger than that of the iPhone 16 (6.1-inch). The iPhone 17e is not expected to get a bigger screen. It will likely sport a 6.1-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate, the same as the iPhone 16e. Dynamic Island: Digital Chat Station reported in August 2025 that the display will have a Dynamic Island – a change from the notch on the iPhone 16e.
OLED: In December 2025, Korean website, The Elec reported that BOE will provide OLED displays to Apple for the iPhone 17e. BOE also provided OLEDs for the iPhone 16e. Samsung Display and LG Display are expected to also provide 17e displays. Bezels: The display, according to The Elec, will have thinner bezels than the 16e. iPhone 17e: Cameras
18MP front camera with square sensor – likely
The iPhone 17e will likely continue to have a single 48MP camera on the back but the 12MP camera on the front (as seen on the iPhone 16e) could get an update in line with the iPhone 17 series). The front-facing cameras across the iPhone 17 range have all been updated to 18MP, so it is possible that the iPhone 17e will see the same update to the selfie camera. If so, it will also include a square sensor capable of taking photos in any orientation without requiring the user to rotate the phone. The notch may be replaced by the Dynamic Island in the iPhone 17e. Foundry | Alex Walker-Todd iPhone 17e: Design &amp; Colors
Digital Island likely to be only visible external change
Colors: There have been no reports relating to the iPhone 17e’s colors. The iPhone 16e is available in black or white, and we expect the same for the iPhone 17e.
Design: No changes are expected for the design, although, as mentioned above, the new iPhone 17e could have a Digital Island instead of the notch at the top of the screen. There is a possibility that the there could be thinner bezels than the 16e, according to The Elec. iPhone 17e: Price
Starting at $599
A January 2026 report on Wccftech suggests that Apple has been able to reduce costs for the new iPhone 17e, so that the price won’t increase. This is thanks to lower costs for the OLED panels Apple is using. The iPhone 16e starts at $599/£599, and Apple is expected to price the iPhone 17e at $599 as well, though no reports have been made so far. Tariffs and production cost increases may affect the price, but since the “e” series is considered Apple’s lowest-priced iPhone, the price would not exceed that of the iPhone 17, which starts at $799, and the iPhone 16, whose price has been reduced to start at $699.

### 19. `EN` [Report: Meta Revives Smartwatch Plans to Take On Apple Watch](data/articles/7ad34972812c858dde7d3ba14348e393.html)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Meta is set to release its first smartwatch this year featuring health-tracking and built-in Meta AI, reports The Information. The smartwatch, which would compete directly with Apple Watch and other brands, is the result of a revived project that Meta canceled in 2022 amid broader spending cuts at its Reality Labs hardware division. The original project involved plans to release three different camera-equipped watch models, but it doesn't sound like they will be part of the company's future product lineup. The new watch is code-named "Malibu 2." include facial recognition – and it sounds like they will almost definitely appear before a pair of mixed reality glasses that the company has also been developing. Internally code-named "Phoenix," the MR glasses are said to have been delayed until 2027. Meta executives are said to have grown concerned that launching too many devices in quick succession could confuse customers, hence the delay. Last year, the Facebook parent company launched its Ray-Ban Display AR glasses, which apparently proved so popular that Meta had to delay an international rollout. Those glasses use a neural wristband for its gestural interface, so it's possible the new smartwatch could potentially take over those controls. Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is developing rival smart glasses, an AI pin, and AirPods with cameras, all of which will connect to the iPhone and will interface with the smarter version of Siri that's in the works.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld According to rumors, 2026 is shaping up to be a huge year for the Mac, starting in just a couple of weeks with Apple’s first event (or “experience”) of the year. Along with the usual faster chips, Apple reportedly has new tricks up its sleeve in 2026, with several new features that will have Mac users everywhere saying, “Finally!” Here are four major overdue announcements we expect to arrive this year.
A budget MacBook
iPhone fans have long pined for a truly affordable MacBook priced below the $999 MacBook Air that isn’t just an older model with a cut-rate price. That dream machine may finally arrive in just two short weeks. On March 4, Apple will hold a series of “experiences” in New York, London, and Shanghai, and the star is expected to be the first-ever low-cost MacBook. After tackling the mid-range market with the MacBook Air, Apple reportedly wants to compete with Chromebooks and Windows laptops, with a new laptop that could be as cheap as $599. Apple will reportedly use an A18 Pro or A19 Pro iPhone chip, and it will likely have a smaller screen than the Air and possibly fewer USB ports. But it will be powerful enough for everyday tasks and light work. For a lot of users, that’s all that’s needed.
MacBooks with OLED displays

iPhone Gift Guide: Cases
If your loved one doesn’t own a case for their iPhone then this may be the best gift you can get them as it will share a bit of personality while protecting their precious phone from knocks, drops, and everyday scrapes. If they already have a case, then buy them a new or better one. Just slipping on a new case can transform an old iPhone into something that feels brand new again. It’s even more satisfying than an iOS update!

iPhone Gift Guide: iPhone power banks
Hands up if your iPhone has never run out of juice during the day when you are far from a convenient power socket. Yeah, right.
Apple used to make a special Smart Battery Case for the iPhone but stopped selling these when it added MagSafe magnetic wireless charging to the iPhone 12 and later. It then sold its own MagSafe Battery Case but stopped making these when it launched the iPhone 15. But fear not, as there are some great MagSafe power banks out there that clamp onto the back of your iPhone (12/13/14/15/16/17) and can recharge the phone for long enough that you can reach a power source.
Of course, Macworld has tested many of them and picked the best MagSafe power banks, but here are a few of our favorites. Pros
Huge 10000mAh battery capacity
Built-in USB-C cable
Wireless or 30W wired charging Retailer Price View Deal Product Price The Anker Zolo Magnetic Power Bank is available in four colors—black, blue, pink or white—and uses MagSafe to magnetically stick to the back of your iPhone when you need a power boost. In our tests, it recharged an iPhone twice over with its 10000mAh battery capacity. Better still, it features its own built-in USB-C cable for charging up the battery pack or wired-charging the iPhone 15/16/17 families that have a USB-C port rather than Lightning. Using the cable rather than MagSafe will charge an iPhone 15/16/17 at an impressive 30W. MagSafe wireless charging is slower at 7.5W but it will still rescue a fading iPhone 12 or later—or you can supply your own Lightning cable (or USB-C for iPhone 15 users) and connect with a wire. It also features a handy kickstand. Anker If you have an older (pre-15) iPhone, then you need a Lightning cable but the non-magnetic Anker Zolo Power Bank has both, meaning it will still be relevant when you upgrade to a USB-C iPhone. And of course you can use the USB-C cable to charge the power bank itself. If you have a family with both USB-C (15/16/17) and Lightning (14 and earlier) iPhones this will suit all models. There’s a handy digital battery-level display, too. This version of the Zolo doesn’t feature wireless charging. Anker With no built-in cable but a fast 15W Qi2 magnetic wireless charging pad, a third option is the Anker MagGo 10K Slim Power Bank (above), which is the slimmest 10K high-capacity wireless power bank we have tested—perfect for carrying with you in a bag for emergencies when your iPhone starts to fade and you are miles from a power socket or have forgotten your charger and cable. Pros
5000mAh battery capacity
Color options
15W wireless or 30W wired charging Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal Product Price This 5K battery pack was the winner for slimmer 5K magnetic power banks in our recharging tests, recharging a faded iPhone 16 Pro by 79%.
Belkin and Amazon offer a choice of colors (It’s available in a range of colors (White, Blue, Sand, Blue, Citrus Yellow, and Gold), and the Apple Store now has an exclusive set of new colors, including a brighter Pink, Deep Purple with a red stand and Teal with a yellow stand
The Belkin’s kickstand is easy to use and feels robust, and the battery pack itself is marginally smaller than the Ugreen. The $49.99 Torras MagStall Power Bank is a little slimmer but wider and boasts a stand/finger-grip, although recharges to a slightly lesser extent. Pros
Fastest 25W wireless or 30W wired charging
5000mAh battery capacity Retailer Price View Deal Product Price This 25W wireless power bank lived up to its claims of wirelessly charging an iPhone 16 Pro from 0% to 50% in 32 minutes—12 to 15 minutes faster than a 15W power bank. That might not sound a lot but when you’re in a rush to charge your phone, every minute counts. 25W wireless charging is limited to the iPhone 16 and 17 families, running at least iOS 26; older iPhones will charge at 15W using this power bank.
The Baseus PicoGo Magnetic 10K Power Bank (AM61) is an output blazer is more ways than one. It is certified Qi 2.2 so charges wirelessly at 25W. The built-in USB-C cable is rated at 45W, which is fast enough to keep even a MacBook going. Pros
Compact iPhone, Watch, AirPods charging stand
10K power bank
Foldable for travel Retailer Price OneAdaptr View Deal Product Price This compact OneGo power bank has it all: it can charge four devices at the same time—including iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods, plus another via its side USB-C port—and then folding up into a lightweight form that can slip into your pocket or overnight bag. iPhone Gift Guide: USB-C iPhone chargers
A simple charger sounds like a boring present but we think any iPhone users would be delighted to receive one of these beauties now that Apple no longer includes one in the box with new iPhones. And which iPhone users couldn’t do with at least one more spare charger at home or in the office—or a special one for travel?
An iPhone charger should be rated at least 20W, and we’d recommend 30W or better as newer iPhones can accept higher wattages than even Apple admits. A 30W charger can handle an iPad Pro and has just enough to power up even a 13-inch MacBook Air.
For more details and options, read our Best Picks roundup of the best iPhone chargers. Further down we recommend some multi-device chargers that might make more of an impact come unwrapping day. Pros
Cute robot-shaped charger
Two color options Retailer Price View Deal View Deal Ugreen View Deal View Deal Product Price The latest GaN (Gallium Nitride) chargers are tiny so we’re used them them being labeled “cute” but this small phone charger really is cute, shaped like a friendly robot. Take off its boots and you’ll find the plug prongs that connect straight into a wall power socket. The boots are even magnetic. Why? We don’t know but you can store the plug protector on most metal surfaces when the charger is in use. When plugged in, the LED screen shows different expressions that refer to the charging states. Its 30W power is enough to fast charge even the biggest iPhone. You’ll need a USB-C to USB-C cable to charge an iPhone 15/16/17 and USB-C to Lightning cable for older iPhones. It’s even powerful enough to keep a small MacBook charged. Pros
Smallest, lightest 30W charger
Foldable plug
Multiple color options Retailer Price View Deal View Deal Anker View Deal Product Price Measuring just 1.12 × 1.12 × 1.39 inches (U.S. model), the 30W Anker USB-C Nano Charger is the smallest 30W USB-C charger we’ve had in our labs for testing, and it weighs just 1.3oz (36g). The U.K. model is larger but also features foldable prongs and is equally incredibly light. It’s available in a range of pastel colors, including Misty Blue, Lilac Purple, Phantom Black, Aurora White, and Natural Green. Pros
Small, light 45W charger
2 ports
Foldable plug Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal Ugreen View Deal Product Price This two-port wall charger from Ugreen is great if your household or office has two phones—one doesn’t even need to be an iPhone! Indeed you could charge your iPhone plus Apple Watch or AirPods, too. Each USB-C port is rated at 45W so one could charge a mid-sized laptop. Using both ports, one will give 25W and the other 20W—enough for a reasonably fast charge. It’s a great compact choice for homes with a couple of devices in need of a power boost. iPhone Gift Guide: MagSafe chargers
While charging using a USB-C cable (USB-C to Lightning for older iPhones, and USB-C to USB-C for the iPhone 15 and later) from your charger is the fastest way to charge an iPhone, more convenient is wireless charging. Since the iPhone 12, wireless charging has become more efficient and therefore faster with Apple’s MagSafe technology that magnetically clamps the iPhone more securely to the wireless charger.
You can buy a simple USB-C to MagSafe charging pad, like Apple’s $39/£39 MagSafe Charger or a third-party alternative, or a multi-device charger that includes a MagSafe charger for iPhone plus a charger for AirPods or Apple Watch. For more details and options, read our Best Picks roundup of the best MagSafe wireless chargers. Pros

The 5W Apple Watch Charger is all set for Watch fast charging, and you can place your AirPods case at he front for three-at-a-time charging. Pros
3-in-1 charging
Fastest 25W for iPhone Retailer Price View Deal View Deal Belkin View Deal View Deal View Deal View Deal Product Price 2025 saw the release of a new wireless charging technology called Qi 2.2, which allows for super-fast 25W speeds, which is nearly as fast as you’ll get with a less convenient charging cable. 25W works only for the iPhone 16 or 17, with older iPhones stuck at 15W, but this is a great gift for owners of the latest iPhones if they also own an Apple Watch and AirPods. Pros
Charges iPhone and AirPods
Adjustable charging pad Retailer Price Check Product Price This is a great budget option for a stand that will charge both your iPhone and AirPods. At 7.5W, Anker’s stand is not as fast at charging as the 15W or 25W models reviewed above, but it will be fast enough for most of us. If speed is your only priority, charge using a cable! Like those pricier charger options, this charger features an adjustable charging pad, so can be angled to your own requirements. Pros
Charges Watch and iPhone (swap Watch for AirPods)
15W Qi2 for iPhone
Compact and portable Retailer Price View Deal View Deal View Deal Twelve South View Deal Product Price The ButterFly charger from Twelve South is a beautiful piece of design and works exactly as it should. You can charge your iPhone and Apple Watch at the same time, or switch the iPhone for your AirPods case if that is your greater need. It’s a great travel charging companion that easily slips into a pocket. There’s the original metal MagSafe ButterFly model or the more affordable ButterFly SE that uses Qi2 but matches MagSafe for 15W iPhone charging speed. The ButterFly comes in five different color options, two exclusive to Twelve South. Pros

Dedicated iPhone pocket
Oozes style and practicality Retailer Price Waterfield View Deal Product Price Handcrafted from full-grain leather in San Francisco this refined super-premium crossbody bag from Waterfield features a dedicated iPhone pocket, which you can access one-handed via the clever magnetic closure that eliminates the need for fumbling with zippers. An extra layer of protection, the self-finding magnetic Fidlock buckle secures the flap in place. There’s also a more open slip pocket at the back.
This bag will just as well suit the style-conscious iPhone user who doesn’t want to stuff their device in their back pocket. There’s plenty of space inside (3.5L) the 10-x-7-x-3-inch bag for more than just your phone, with another zipped pocket for your less-often required essentials. The black leather model of the Hudson is the most dressy of this beautiful bag, with the Chocolate and Grizzly colorways a little more casual but still very smart. iPhone Gift Guide: iPhone stands
If you don’t need wireless charging with your iPhone stand, here are our favorite iPhone stands. Pros
Flexible iPhone stand

Or you simply want to flip your phone into a more comfortable viewing position? Inspired by origami, the Moft Snap Wallet Tripod could be several solutions you are looking for. It folds up into a credit-card-sized device that’s just 0.36 inches thick and weighs 4.7oz, so you hardly notice in your pocket even though unfolded it can raise your iPhone by up to 8 inches. It’s clever and you’ll be surprised just how useful it can be.

Plus you can store two credit or travel cards in it even when it’s connected to you phone. Pros
360° iPhone stand
Dual-sided magnetic design
Includes finger-friendly grip Retailer Price View Deal Aulumu View Deal Product Price Aulumu calls its lightweight (34g) G09 Infinite Rotation Dual-Mag Stand “the first true 3-axis smartphone stand”.

It makes a lovely gift for an iPhone users who no longer carries a wallet but still needs a few cards to hand. iPhone Gift Guide: Lightning and USB-C cables
If you thought that chargers might be a boring gift, I hope we’ve persuaded you otherwise. But how would you feel unwrapping a charging cable? Me? I’d be delighted as you can’t own enough charging cables, can you? They are always handy. Sure, it’s not a pony or a new TV but it’s easier to wrap.
Older iPhones will need a USB-C to Lightning cable; check out our roundup of the best Lightning cables. Pair one of these with a USB-C charger, see above, for the fastest charging. An older USB-A to Lightning cable doesn’t support iPhone fast charging.
The iPhone 15, 16 and 17 families now have a USB-C rather than Lightning port so you can use the same cable as you have for your MacBook. We have tested the best USB-C cables for iPhones and can recommend these as great little gifts. Pros

Tidily retractable
Takes up little space
No knots Retailer Price View Deal Baseus View Deal Product Price Cables are by definition awkward things to carry around. They get tied up in knots all by themselves, are a unsightly nuisance, and are tricky to store. This thin 3.3-foot (1m) or 5.5ft (2m) USB-C cable is retractable so will slip into a drawer or pocket without dangling around getting in the way. You can buy it in black, white, purple or blue and is rated to support 100W so it can be used to charge your MacBook, too.

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld As we have extensively covered, Apple is rumored to soon introduce new products, as the company recently confirmed a special announcement for March 4. Among the expected products are a low-cost MacBook and a new generation of Studio Display.
If you needed more evidence that these products will soon be arriving in stores, here’s proof from Apple itself. Code from macOS 26.3, released last week to the public, confirms the existence of such devices.
As discovered by Macworld, the final build of macOS 26.3 released to the public on February 11 includes kernel extensions (kexts) for three new devices identified as J700, J427, and J527. The codenames match previous reports, including those based on an internal build of iOS 26 leaked last year.
Low-cost MacBook essentially confirmed
J700 is the codename for the rumored new low-cost MacBook. This Mac is expected to be priced lower than the current MacBook Air, and will be the first Apple silicon Mac to be powered by an A-series chip instead of an M-series one.
More specifically, the new entry-level MacBook will reportedly have the same A18 Pro chip as the iPhone 16 Pro models. Benchmark tests show that the A18 Pro performs slightly better than the M1, which is good enough for most casual users who will be the target audience for this new laptop.
More recently, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that the laptop will have a display that’s slightly under 13 inches and will be made of aluminum, despite its lower price. Some analysts believe it will cost as low as $599, but a price between $699 and $799 is more likely. Apple’s Studio Display is nearly four years old and in need of an update. Foundry Studio Display 2 may have an extra surprise
In addition to the highly anticipated MacBook, macOS 26.3 includes drivers for two other unreleased devices: J427 and J527, both variants of a new generation of Studio Display.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Keyword:** `Apple`
West Virginia's Attorney General JB McCuskey today announced a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of knowingly allowing iCloud to be used to distribute and store child sexual abuse material (CSAM). McCuskey says that Apple has opted to "do nothing about it" for years. "Preserving the privacy of child predators is absolutely inexcusable. And more importantly, it violates West Virginia law. Since Apple has so far refused to police themselves and do the morally right thing, I am filing this lawsuit to demand Apple follow the law, report these images, and stop re-victimizing children by allowing these images to be stored and shared," Attorney General JB McCuskey said. According to the lawsuit [PDF], Apple has described itself as the "greatest platform for distributing child porn" internally, but it submits far fewer reports about CSAM than peers like Google and Meta. new child safety features, including a system that would detect known CSAM in images stored in iCloud Photos. After backlash from customers, digital rights groups, child safety advocates, and security researchers, Apple decided to abandon its plans for CSAM detection in ‌iCloud Photos‌. "Children can be protected without companies combing through personal data, and we will continue working with governments, child advocates, and other companies to help protect young people, preserve their right to privacy, and make the internet a safer place for children and for us all," Apple said when announcing that it would not implement the feature. later explained that creating a tool for scanning private ‌iCloud‌ data would "create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit." West Virginia's Attorney General says that Apple has shirked its responsibility to protect children under the guise of user privacy, and that Apple's decision not to deploy detection technology is a choice, not passive oversight. The lawsuit suggests that since Apple has end-to-end control over hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure, it is not able to claim to be an "unknowing, passive conduit of CSAM." The lawsuit is seeking punitive damages and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection measures. Tag: Apple Lawsuits

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Apple's iPhone satellite capabilities can grow, but physics are remorseless. There's still a limit on how much satellite internet can do and how fast it can do it — unless Apple produces a case that it has been researching that doubles as a big antenna.
When Apple first launched Emergency SOS via Satellite with the iPhone 14 back in 2022, it was remarkable idea that since then has saved many lives. Apple has improved it since, and has plans for much more in future, but there is always an issue over establishing the satellite contact.
Users have to point their iPhone in the direction of a satellite orbiting the Earth, and then keep pointing at it as the satellite moves relative to the sender. One single low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite will cross from horizon to horizon in seven minutes, but line-of-site connection time is less than that in real life, and depends on buildings, trees, and terrain.
The iPhone software helps locate and track the satellite. The iPhone antenna still has a small surface area, and isn't that high-powered. Only so much data can reliably be sent before the satellite has moved away.
Now in a newly-revealed patent application originally filed in 2024, Apple has shown how it has been researching a way around this. "Electronic Device and Case with Satellite Communication Capabilities" details ways of using a case to act as an antenna for the iPhone. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

It's pretty common these days. A TikTok lie about Apple pops up, and it's passed around and cloned on the site. Millions of hits later, it reaches the ears of mainstream media, who pick it up like it's gospel, straight from Tim Cook's desk.
The latest lie is that the 2026 iPhone is getting a nearly microscopic MacBook-like Magsafe charger, and USB-C will be purged from the device. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

Apple is formally making room for AI agents in the car, adding a new voice-based conversational app category to CarPlay in iOS 26.4. Siri remains the system-level voice assistant in CarPlay
Apple's February 9, 2026 update to the CarPlay Developer Guide introduces a new CarPlay entitlement category for voice-driven conversational apps. The move creates an official path for third-party AI assistants to operate inside CarPlay rather than relying solely on Siri.
The change arrives as generative AI becomes more embedded across Apple platforms. CarPlay is next, but Apple is setting clear boundaries. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

Macworld TL;DR: This MacBook Air is only $199.97 right now, and shipping is free.
The RAM shortage is already starting to affect computer prices, but it hasn’t touched refurbished devices yet. If you need a low-cost computer for the basics, this MacBook Air is still a good option for only $199.97 (MSRP $999).
Inside, this MacBook has a 1.8GHz Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB solid-state drive. That combination is enough for web browsing, note-taking, light photo work, and office productivity. The 13.3-inch display has a 1440×900 resolution, which is sharp enough for documents and video without hammering the battery. You also get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you can connect to wireless networks, headphones, and other accessories without hassle. Fully charged, the battery can last up to 12 hours, which gives you plenty of room during busy days when you can’t sit down at an outlet.
This unit has a Grade “A/B” refurbished rating, which means it’s fully tested but may have light scuffs or small marks on the case. That’s also why the price is so low. It can update to macOS Monterey, which keeps it compatible with most modern software, though it will not move to newer macOS 26 releases. You also get a MagSafe charger in the box and a limited third-party warranty.
Shipping is free.
Right now, you can get a MacBook Air on sale for $199.97.

On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that sweeping tariffs introduced by President Trump were done illegally. While Trump's retaliation was expected, it seems that he didn't believe he went far enough with his new tariff plan.
Trump introduced a new global import tariff of 10% under Section 122 on Friday, which follows rules including being a uniform rate instead of country-specific, and for a limited term of up to 150 days unless Congress extends the period. However, Section 122 did permit temporary tariffs of up to 15%, higher than the 10% rate set by the President. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

Macworld TL;DR: CleanMy Phone scans duplicates, compresses media, and organizes your camera roll so your iPhone feels new again — for just $19.99.
You know the warning: “iPhone Storage Full.” Suddenly, you’re speed-deleting photos from 2017, removing apps you still probably need, and debating whether one blurry brunch pic is worth iCloud rent.
Instead, there’s an affordable and easy solution.
CleanMy Phone (now $19.99, normally $44.99) acts like a spring cleaning crew for your camera roll. The app scans your device and intelligently finds duplicate photos, giant videos, forgotten screenshots, and low-quality shots you didn’t realize were multiplying.
The surprisingly helpful part? It doesn’t just delete — it suggests. AI highlights the best image in a group, compresses videos without wrecking quality, and can even convert Live Photos to standard shots to save serious space.
Everything runs locally on your device, so your photos never leave your phone. No uploading, no weird privacy tradeoffs — just a cleaner library.
It also shows real-time storage analytics, so you finally understand why 40GB vanished overnight (spoiler: videos and memes).
Instead of upgrading storage again, you might just clean it up.
Because most phones don’t need replacing — they need organizing.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Ten months after Trump imposed sweeping tariffs that hurt US businesses and consumers, and hit Apple to the tune of $3.2 billion, the Supreme Court has ruled that it was done illegally. Refunds will be messy. Trump launching his tariffs in April 2205
Trump was always expected to introduce tariffs, but the extent of his April 2025 "Liberation Day" ones caught the world by surprise. The claimed mathematics behind the original rates was ridiculed, and then Trump further raised them to ostensibly punish countries, or even individuals like Tim Cook.
The Supreme Court has ruled 6 to 3 that imposing the tariffs without Congress's involvement was illegal. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the ruling, which denied Trump's claim that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) gave him the authority to act unilaterally.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Hours after the Supreme Court struck down broad "reciprocal" tariffs as unlawful, President Donald Trump lashed out at justices, and said he will impose a 10% global tariff under a different trade law with more restrictions and a timetable. President Trump introduces a global import tax. Image credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
The announcement follows a 6-3 ruling that the earlier tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, exceeded presidential authority and required congressional approval. The now-invalidated tariffs have cost Apple about $2 billion.
Section 122 provides a narrower legal pathway, but it doesn't soften the economic impact. The statute permits temporary tariffs of up to 15% total for 150 days unless Congress votes to extend them. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

Macworld Listen, we love MacBooks around here, but we hate paying Apple’s storage upgrade prices. That’s why today’s deal is so good: B&amp;H Photo is selling the M5 MacBook Pro with 1TB of storage space for $1,599, the same price as the 512GB version. Now that’s a deal worth getting!
So, the 14-inch MacBook Pro M5 is an absolute beast of a laptop that we gave a 4.5-star rating to and our Editors’ Choice award. We loved the improved CPU and GPU performance, as well as how speedy the drive is. We concluded that “the M5 MacBook Pro offers a great combination of price and performance.” And with this deal, you’ll get twice the storage without paying a penny more
The model’s 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR Display delivers crisp visuals and vibrant colors, as well as an amazing 1,000 nits of brightness that will make it easy to use the laptop in any lighting situation. The laptop also features a slew of ports, including Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, USB-C, and an SD card reader, as well as MagSafe for power.

Preview is one of the long-standing apps on macOS, having been included with the operating system for decades. In 2025, Preview finally moved over to iOS 26 and iPadOS 26, with a version tailored for mobile devices.
It is also a severely underrated app, as it is chiefly used as a way to view images and PDFs on the Mac. It's a lightweight viewer that saves you from needing to open other heavier applications, like Photoshop or Adobe Acrobat. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums

**Source:** Macworld | **Keyword:** `Apple`
Macworld Apple has a new AirTag for sale, but you’re probably not rushing out to buy one since you can still get the old ones for cheaper. But this deal may change your mind: Costco is throwing in a free AirTag when you buy a 4-pack for $100, essentially giving you five new AirTags for the price of 4, a savings of $45 on the price of buying five AirTags individually. (Note: You don’t need to be a member to take advantage of this deal.)
Apple’s 2nd-gen of AirTags have the same size as the previous model, and they look virtually the same. However, they have a louder speaker, which will make them easier to find even if your keys somehow ended up between couch cushions. Apple also upgraded the Bluetooth chip inside the tracker, expanding the range at which items can be located.
Also new is the U2 Ultra Wideband chip, which will make it possible to more precisely locate lost items, something that will definitely be handy. We’ve already tested the new AirTag 2 and gave it a 4-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award, finding it to be a simple and efficient Bluetooth tracker that’s also super easy to set up and fairly inexpensive.

The six-episode French-language drama was scheduled to launch on December 3, 2025. In late November, it disappeared from Apple's platform after reports surfaced that it may have been mislabeled as an original work.

​ Où ? 100% en ligne! Un lien de connexion vous sera envoyé après votre inscription
​ ? Avec la plateforme de cartographie libre et contributive OpenStreetMap (OSM, le «Wikipédia des cartes») tout le monde peut participer à la cartographie de n’importe quelle zone de la planète: il suffit d’un ordinateur, d’une souris et d’une connexion internet! Accessibles à tout·es, nous serons là pour vous accompagner pour vos premiers pas avec OSM.

gull, paulla, logiciels-libres, projets, futur, assemblée-générale [FR Paris] Soirée de contribution au libre – Le jeudi 12 février 2026 de 19h30 à 22h00.
Le but des soirées de contribution au libre est de proposer un espace de travail partagé aux personnes actives dans le libre en Île-de-France le temps d’une soirée, une fois par mois (le deuxième jeudi du mois plus précisément).
Dit plus court: c’est un lieu avec de l’électricité et une connexion internet. En avant les claviers !
Les soirées de contribution au libre sont faites pour vous si:
vous travaillez sur un projet libre et vous recherchez une atmosphère à la fois conviviale et studieuse pour aller de l’avant et, qui sait, créer des connexions avec d’autres projets libres, vous êtes un collectif autour du libre et vous cherchez un lieu pour vous retrouver physiquement et avancer avec efficacité sur vos chantiers. Si vous n’avez pas envie de contribuer à un projet libre, les soirées de contribution au libre ne sont sans doute pas faites pour vous. Pas de panique, Parinux organise d’autres évènements:
si vous voulez discuter autour du libre: l’Apéro du Libre (APL) est là pour ça ; c’est un rendez-vous fixé tous les 15 du mois ; venez-nous retrouver autour d’un verre pour papoter et refaire le monde (libre), si vous avez un problème informatique: c’est la vocation de Premiers Samedi du Libre (PSL) où vous pourrez trouver des oreilles attentives et compétentes à l’écoute de toutes vos questions. Nous nous réservons le droit de refuser l’entrée aux soirées de contribution au libre à tout personne qui n’en respecterait pas l’esprit. Et, bien sûr, les règles de bienséance habituelles s’appliquent pour que chacune et chacun se sente à l’aise dans un cadre bienveillant.
Si les soirées de contribution vous intéressent, le mieux est de contacter d’abord le CA de Parinux ca@parinux.org. Vous devrez de toute façon nous écrire pour obtenir le code de la porte cochère…

Rencontre mensuelle autour des logiciels libres, en toute simplicité.
Ces matinées seront ce que nous en ferons ensemble, selon vos attentes:
Découverte des logiciels libres dont Linux et de leur intérêt. Utilisation sur place.
Installations, sur votre machine (pensez à sauvegarder vos données avant de venir avec) ou sur des PC fournis pour apprendre ensemble sans risque. Parfois, on vous propose un ordinateur auquel Linux a redonné une seconde vie, avec lequel vous pouvez repartir…
Préparation d’une clé USB pour tester Linux chez vous, l’installer ou alors pour utiliser des logiciels libres sans installation sous Windows.
Entraide, suivi de votre expérience avec les logiciels libres.
Nous pourrons aussi nous intéresser aux outils en ligne, aux smartphones, ou nous amuser à redonner vie à de vieux PC un peu obsolètes, à reconditionner des ordinateurs pour des associations ou personnes avec peu de ressources, etc.
Pour tout projet qui risque de prendre un peu de temps, il est préférable de nous contacter avant.
Les débutant·e·s sont les bienvenu·e·s! Les autres aussi, bien évidemment !

### 3. `FR` [Nouvelles de Haiku - Hiver 2025-26](data/articles/5513552cd42722ebbaddda91c1eba20d.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Haiku est un système d’exploitation pensé pour les ordinateurs de bureau. Il est basé sur BeOS mais propose aujourd’hui une implémentation modernisée, performante, et qui conserve les idées qui rendaient BeOS intéressant: une interface intuitive mais permettant une utilisation avancée, une API unifiée et cohérente, et une priorisation de l’interface graphique par rapport à la ligne de commande pour l’administration du système.
Il ne s’agit pas d’une distribution Linux, mais d’un système complet avec son propre noyau, sa propre pile graphique, etc. L’idée de cette approche est d’avoir une seule équipe travaillant sur toute la pile logicielle, pour éviter les soucis de coordination entre projets indépendant et d’excès de modularité, qui peuvent aboutir à une architecture logicielle inefficace. En revanche, cela demande un gros travail pour une équipe relativement réduite, et le système est donc en développement depuis bientôt un quart de siècle sans avoir encore publié une version majeure complète.
La cinquième version beta a été publiée en 2024. Les développements continuent pour stabiliser, optimiser et peaufiner le système, avec une version beta 6 prévue en début de cette année, qui sera probablement suivie par une beta 7 quelque temps plus tard.
Cette série de dépêches est basée sur les rapports d’activité publiés mensuellement par le projet Haiku. Cette édition couvre les modifications de Haiku numérotées entre hrev59111 et hrev59355 (soit 244 changements individuels), en plus d’activités se déroulant hors du dépôt Git principal.
Entre parenthèses est indiqué le pseudonyme de l’auteur ou autrice principal·e du changement.

Mise à jour de haiku-format
À quand la beta 6?
Mise à jour de Go en version 1.18
Le mois de novembre a vu l’arrivée d’une grosse mise à jour de la chaîne d’outils pour le langage Go en version 1.18. Il s’agit d’une version de 2022, mais c’est un gros progrès puisque la version précédente disponible pour Haiku était la version 1.4 datant de 2014. De plus, cette version 1.18 est disponible dans le dépôt de paquets et peut être installée normalement avec pkgman (au moins pour les architectures x86 et x86_64).
La plus grande partie du travail a été réalisée par Korli, depuis plusieurs années, pour mettre en place l’environnement de compilation nécessaire, et aussi corriger de nombreux problèmes de compatibilité POSIX dans Haiku qui ont été mis en évidence par les tests de Go.
Cela permet par exemple d’utiliser Hugo, le générateur de site statique utilisé pour le site principal de Haiku. Waddlesplash a donc pu rédiger et vérifier le rapport d’activité de novembre en utilisant uniquement Haiku : avec Hugo, WebPositive (le navigateur natif de Haiku, basé sur WebKit), l’éditeur de texte Koder, ainsi que Iceweasel (un portage de Firefox) pour la correction d’orthographe.
Redémarrage automatique de app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique de Haiku. Il s’agit d’un composant critique, pour lequel un crash rend le système à peu près inutilisable. Waddlesplash a corrigé plusieurs problèmes dans le code pour permettre de redémarrer le serveur après un crash, et de le reconnecter avec les applications en cours d’exécution. Ce redémarrage nécessite encore quelques étapes manuelles car les crash démarrent actuellement le debugger automatiquement, mais cela peut être changé par une simple configuration.
Applications
ActivityMonitor
ActivityMonitor affiche sous forme graphique divers paramètres du système: charge CPU, consommation mémoire… Il peut s’exécuter dans une fenêtre ou bien être intégré au bureau sous forme d’un « réplicant ».
Affichage d’un message « pas de capteurs de température » à la place du graphe de température du système si l’information n’est pas disponible (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème de localisation, certains fichiers sources n’étaient pas pris en compte et les chaînes contenues dedans ne pouvaient pas être traduites (humdinger).
Terminal
Le Terminal permet d’exécuter des applications en ligne de commande.
Synchronisation du presse-papier interne du Terminal avec celui du système seulement une fois au démarrage de l’application, et pas lors du changement d’onglet comme cela avait été implémenté au trimestre précédent (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème qui masquait le signal SIGUSR1 pour les shells et autres processus lancés dans le terminal (korli).
Implémentation des séquences d’échappement permettant aux applications CLI de définir des liens hypertextes (en complément des liens qui étaient déjà détectés automatiquement par le terminal en fonction du contenu du texte) (korli).
HaikuDepot
HaikuDepot est l’interface graphique du gestionnaire de paquets. Il utilise un backend en ligne en Java pour stocker et récupérer les captures d’écrans, et notes d’utilisateurs, icônes des paquets, liste de paquets mis en avant, et d’autres informations.
L’application est plus robuste en cas de problème de réseau : gestion des erreurs et affichage de messages clairs pour l’utilisateur. Gestion en particulier des erreurs 503 remontées par l’API web utilisée par HaikuDepot (apl).
Ajout de filtres pour trouver facilement les applications « natives » (n’utilisant pas Qt ou GTK) et d’un filtre « desktop » pour trouver les applications graphiques (et filtrer un très grand nombre de paquets de bibliothèques, applications en ligne de commande…) (apl, avec des améliorations par humdinger pour clarifier la terminologie).
Amélioration de la taille de la fenêtre des conditions d’utilisation sur les écrans haute densité (nipos).
Refonte de la gestion des identifiants de messages internes à l’application HaikuDepot pour en simplifier la maintenance (apl).
Interdiction de la sélection multiple dans la liste des paquets (apl).
WebPositive
WebPositive est le navigateur web fourni avec Haiku. Il est basé sur le moteur WebKit, co-développé avec Apple, Sony, Igalia et d’autres participants.
Modification du message envoyé au Tracker pour ouvrir le dossier contenant un fichier (par exemple un téléchargement), pour utiliser le message officiellement prévu à cet effet plutôt qu’un moyen détourné (humdinger).
Meilleure gestion des noms de fichiers longs dans la fenêtre de téléchargements avec l’ajout d’une barre de défilement horizontal (mull, avec un petit correctif par humdinger pour corriger un décalage d’un pixel du positionnement de la barre de défilement).
Un chantier est en cours pour réintégrer à nouveau le portage de WebKit pour Haiku dans les sources upstream. Cela avait déjà été fait en 2010, mais n’avait pas été maintenu par la suite, ce qui a conduit à retirer ce code. Depuis, Haiku utilise un fork resynchronisé régulièrement, mais cela génère du travail en plus. L’envoi du code est aussi l’occasion de faire relire toutes les modifications par les autres développeurs de WebKit, avec des conseils pour améliorer et simplifier l’architecture.
Expander
Expander est une application permettant de décompresser des archives.
Correction d’un décalage d’un pixel de la barre de défilement (humdinger).
AboutSystem
AboutSystem affiche quelques informations sur le système et surtout la liste des auteurs de Haiku.
Simplification du code pour la mise à jour automatique des couleurs, mise en place de la mise à jour automatique des couleurs pour la liste des crédits (si on passe en mode sombre par exemple) (jscipione).
Ouverture de la fenêtre avec une taille respectant les proportions du nombre d’or, esthétiquement plus plaisant (axeld).
LaunchBox
LaunchBox est un « dock » permettant de stocker des raccourcis vers des applications ou fichiers fréquemment utilisés.
Correction de la couleur du panneau de LaunchBox, et d’autres couleurs dans le sélectionneur de couleurs standard (nephele).
Tracker
Tracker est l’explorateur de fichiers. Le code du Tracker contient également les fenêtres « ouvrir » et « enregistrer sous », mises à disposition des autres applications sous forme de la bibliothèque libtracker.so.
Envoi de la notification d’activation de l’espace de travail à tous les réplicants, afin que ces derniers puissent ajuster leur couleur (par exemple) en fonction de l’espace de travail actif (jscipione).
Correction du positionnement du champ de texte lors du renommage de fichiers dans la vue par icônes, résolution de problèmes de gestion de l’état des fenêtres après un glisser-déposer avorté, affichage des volumes disque en premier (avant les dossiers) si l’option « trier les dossiers en premier » est active, synchronisation en direct des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers lors du changement d’options, et divers nettoyages de code (jscipione).
Ajout d’une bordure manquante dans les fenêtres de sélection de fichiers (nipos).
Ajout du nombre d’élément sélectionnés (en plus du nombre d’éléments total du dossier) dans les fenêtres du Tracker (nathan242).
Correction d’un problème de concurrence dans le constructeur des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers, dont la conséquence était une mauvaise disposition des contrôles dans la fenêtre (certains boutons apparaissant superposés par exemple (PulkoMandy).
Amélioration de l’image d’aperçu qui suit la souris lors d’un glisser-déplacer lorsqu’on déplace beaucoup de fichiers: l’image est tronquée pour ne pas être trop grande mais le dégradé de transparence sur les bords n’était pas bien calculé (PulkoMandy).
Déclenchement automatique du « renifleur » de type MIME, qui identifie automatiquement les fichiers pour les afficher avec la bonne icône par exemple. En particulier cela rend l’utilisation du Tracker plus confortable sur les systèmes de fichiers ne permettant pas de stocker le type MIME dans un attribut étendu (Jim906).
Correction d’une régression sur la mise à jour en direct des tailles et dates de modification de fichiers dans les résultats de requêtes (waddlesplash).
MediaPlayer
MediaPlayer est une application pour lire des fichiers média (son et vidéo).
Correction de la couleur du texte dans la fenêtre d’informations (nephele).
Dans cette même fenêtre, le champ indiquant le chemin du fichier en cours de lecture est maintenant cliquable (nathan242, dont c’est la première contribution).
Ajout d’une détection automatique du type MIME des fichiers, s’il n’est pas renseigné (par exemple s’il est stocké sur un système de fichiers où il n’y a pas d’attributs étendus) (DigitalBox98).
Sudoku
Sudoku est un jeu de Sudoku, très utile pour patienter pendant une compilation un peu longue.
Amélioration de la palette de couleurs en mode clair (le mode sombre nécessite encore du travail) (axeld).
DeskBar
DeskBar est la barre des tâches de BeOS et de Haiku. La même application contient également le code pour la fenêtre de changement de tâches « Twitcher ».
Correction d’un bug qui faisait apparaître des applications en double dans le « Twitcher » (la fenêtre de changement rapide d’application qui apparaît avec le raccourci Alt+Tab) (madmax).
People
People est un gestionnaire de contacts. Il stocke les contacts dans des fichiers « person » avec les informations sous forme d’attributs étendus.
Correction du défilement avec la molette de la souris ou au touchpad (nipos).
Lecteur MIDI
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
MidiPlayer
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
Changement de la couleur du contrôle de volume qui était codée en dur, non configurable et pas harmonisée avec le reste du système (nipos).
ProcessController
ProcessController affiche la charge CPU et l’occupation mémoire dans la DeskBar. Il permet également d’afficher des statistiques par application, et de débugger et stopper des applications via un menu popup.
Ajustements pour les écrans haute densité : taille des menus, largeur par défaut de l’icône réplicant, autorisation du redimensionnement de la fenêtre principale (la taille est conservée si on installe ensuite un réplicant sur le bureau, et divers autres changements (waddlesplash).
Installer
Installer permet de cloner l’installation de Haiku actuelle vers un autre disque.
Ajout d’un outil pour copier automatiquement le chargeur de démarrage sur la partition EFI du système, pour réduire le nombre d’étapes manuelles pour installer Haiku correctement sur un système EFI (PawanYr, avec des améliorations de kallisti5 pour nommer le fichier installé correctement en fonction de l’architecture CPU du système).
Amélioration du calcul de la taille de la fenêtre « EULA » de l’installeur (qui affiche non pas un contrat de license, mais un message de bienvenue et quelques instructions pour l’installation), en fonction de la taille de texte sélectionnée dans les préférences (nipos).
Mail
L'application Mail permet de lire et de rédiger des e-mail. Elle fonctionne en collaboration avec le mail_server qui s’occupe de l’envoi et de la réception des messages.
Correction d’une régression sur la couleur de fond des champs d’adresse. Mise en place des mises à jour de couleurs automatiques. Les champs désactivés ou en lecture seule sont maintenant « navigables » (avec la touche tab) et le texte peut être sélectionné et copié (jscipione).
Les boutons « suivant » et « précédent » peuvent être accompagnés de la touche Maj. (Shift), pour changer de message sans modifier le statut « lu » des messages (humdinger).
DriveSetup
DriveSetup permet de configurer les supports de stockage: formatage, partitionnement.
L’application s’affiche sur tous les espaces de travail si la DeskBar n’est pas lancée. Ce cas particulier est utile lors du lancement de l’installation de Haiku, dans ce cas, le bureau n’est pas lancé, mais il est tout de même possible d’utiliser plusieurs espaces de travail, ce qui peut donner l’impression que les fenêtres ont disparu si on se retrouve sur un espace vide (PulkoMandy).
Finalisation d’un patch datant d’il y a plusieurs années pour ajouter un menu permettant d’écrire ou de lire des images disques depuis ou vers des partitions (plus besoin d’utiliser dd en ligne de commande) (sed4096, avec l’aide d’humdinger pour des améliorations de localisation et de choix de vocabulaire).
Debugger
Debugger permet de débugger les logiciels fonctionnant dans Haiku.
Correction d’un crash lorsqu’on essaie de débugger des applications trop grosses, par exemples celle utilisant Mesa et llvmpipe pour faire du rendu 3D (waddlesplash).
Changements transverses
Modification de toutes les chaînes de caractères où le nom d’une application est présent (par exemple : « Deskbar preferences »). En effet, le nom des applications peut optionnellement être traduit, et toutes ces chaînes doivent donc s’adapter dans les deux cas (nom d’application traduit ou conservé en anglais selon les préférences de l’utilisateur). Auparavant ce réglage ne pouvait pas être appliqué de façon systématique (humdinger).
Fenêtres de préférences
Réseau
Affichage de l’état précis des interfaces réseau (en cours de configuration DHCP, par exemple) et pas seulement « hors ligne » ou « en ligne » (nipos).
Périphériques d’entrée
Ajout et amélioration de plusieurs options pour la gestion des touchpad (samuelrp84). Voir plus bas les informations sur la réécriture du pilote Elantech qui donne plus de détails.
Apparence
Envoi d’un seul message de mise à jour aux applications lorsque plusieurs couleurs changent simultanément, ce qui est plus efficace et réduit les « clignotements » d’applications dans certains cas (nephele).
Correction de la hauteur des fausses barres de défilement visibles dans la fenêtre d’apparence pour configurer les barres de défilement (jscipione).
Outils en ligne de commande
Le réplicant NetworkStatus peut être installé dans la DeskBar via la ligne de commande même lorsque une fenêtre de NetworkStatus est déjà ouverte (nipos).
Ajout dans strace de l’affichage des structures stat, sockopt, sigset_t, sigprocmask et des noms de signaux (korli avec un correctif par nathan242).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans l’interface en ligne de commande du Debugger, qui conduisaient entre autres à un gel de l’application. Cette interface est surtout utilisée en cas de crash d’un service critique (app_server, registrar, input_server) qui empêcherait l’utilisation de l’interface graphique. Les investigations sur ces services en cas de crash sont donc facilitées.
Modification de bfs_tools pour rendre ces outils compilables sur le système hôte utilisé pour compiler Haiku (axeld). Ces outils permettent de manipuler à la main un système de fichiers bfs, de récupérer certaines données sur un disque corrompu, et diverses manipulations de bas niveau.
Modification de l’outil makebootable pour vérifier que la partition à rendre bootable est bien une partition BFS. Utiliser l’outil sur une partition d’un autre format ou sur un disque complet pourrait corrompre le système de fichier et rendre les données inaccessibles. Ajout d’un message indiquant lorsque le lancement de makebootable n’est pas nécessaire, car les utilisateurs continuent de recommander de lancer cet outil sans aucune raison pour corriger des problèmes de démarrage (encourageant ainsi les nouveaux utilisateurs à faire dea mauvaises manipulations et à corrompre leur système de fichiers) (PulkoMandy).
Suppression d’une verrue dans checkfs qui n’est plus nécessaire suite à des améliorations du Storage Kit. Cela permet de lancer checkfs pour vérifier une partition en donnant le chemin de n’importe quel fichier contenu dans la partition (waddlesplash).
Activation du support de l’IPv6 dans telnet, implémentation dans netstat (avec des corrections sur les opérateurs de filtrage), et ajout de traceroute6 compilé à partir des sources fournies par NetBSD (cmeerw).
Amélioration de l’affichage de df avec plus d’informations, un listage sur deux lignes, et l’ajout d’une option pour afficher les informations standardisées dans le format imposé par POSIX (nipos et PulkoMandy).
Kits
Interface
L'interface kit se charge de tout l’affichage de fenêtres à l’écran et des contrôles de base (boutons, cases à cocher…)
Correction d’un bug dans le contrôle calendrier lors du déplacement vers les mois suivant ou précédent (nipos).
Correction d’un problème de navigation au clavier dans une ListView après l’insertion de nouveaux objets (nipos).
BControl (la classe parente de tous les contrôles d’interface graphique) ne change plus ses couleurs dans la fonction AttachedToWindow(). Ce n’est plus nécessaire après d’autres changements dans BButton, et cela simplifie le code nécessaire pour personnaliser la couleur d’un contrôle spécifique (pour avoir, par exemple, un bouton rouge) (jscipione).
Améliorations sur BSlider: correction de la couleur du texte, nettoyage du code de dessin des sliders dans les implémentations de ControlLook (jscipione).
Augmentation de la taille des marques sur les boutons des barres de défilement (marques qui ne sont pas activées à moins de modifier manuellement un fichier de configuration) pour les rendre plus visibles sur les hautes résolutions (jscipione).
Les infobulles utilisent un espacement calculé en fonction de la taille du texte, pour une apparence plus jolie sur les écrans à haute densité (waddlesplash).
Séparation du titre des onglets et du nom des vues qui leurs sont attachées. Le comportement original est hérité de BeOS, il est donc préservé pour les anciennes applications. Mais pour les nouvelles applications, le nom interne des vues ne doit pas être traduit (il peut être utilisé par des scripts ou par le code de l’application), tandis que le titre affiché à l’utilisateur doit l’être. C’était le seul endroit où ce principe de séparation du nom et du texte affiché n’était pas respecté (KapiX et PulkoMandy).
Dans BTextView, la fonction « tout sélectionner » déplace le curseur à la fin de la sélection (et à la fin du texte). C’est le comportement de la plupart des autres systèmes, et préserver la position du curseur dans ce cas ne semble pas particulièrement utile (OscarL).
Correction de problèmes de choix de couleurs dans le code qui dessine des sliders avec un curseur triangulaire (nipos). Cette correction a permis d’utiliser ce type de slider dans les fenêtres de réglages de différents traducteurs d’images.
Amélioration de l’apparence des cases à cocher partiellement cochées. Elles s’affichent avec un signe "-" au lieu d’une croix. Auparavant, la couleur était subtilement modifiée mais ce n’était pas très visible (PulkoMandy).
Implémentation de la lecture d’un son dans BAlert, qui peut être activé dans les préférences de son (sed4096).
Storage
Le storage kit permet de contrôler les disques et supports de stockage (liste des partitions, montage et démontage, accès aux fichiers, chemins d’accès, requêtes…)
BPartition retourne une erreur B_BUSY si on essaie de monter une partition qui est déjà montée à un autre endroit, au lieu de la monter une deuxième fois (jscipione).
Device
Le device kit permet l’interaction directe avec certains périphériques (USB, série, joysticks…) directement depuis l’espace utilisateur.
Correction de problèmes de gestion de la mémoire dans BUSBInterface mis en évidence par AtomoZero lors d’expérimentations pour corriger le pilote de webcam à l’aide d’un LLM (waddlesplash).
Package
Le package kit se charge de la résolution des dépendances entre paquets et du téléchargement des paquets à installer. Il fonctionne en collaboration avec le système de fichier packagefs qui permet d’accéder au contenu des paquets une fois installés.
Retravail de BRepositoryCache pour remonter les informations sur les paquets via un callback plutôt que de remplir une structure BPackageInfoSet. Cela économise beaucoup de mémoire et d’allocations mémoire, et rend donc la lecture des dépôts de paquets plus rapide (waddlesplash).
Serveurs
Notifications
Le serveur de notifications permet d’afficher des notifications pour les évènements importants.
Les notifications déjà affichées changent de position immédiatement lorsque la configuration est modifiée pour les déplacer (nipos).
Ajout de la lecture de l’effet sonore choisi dans les préférences de son lors de l’apparition des différents types de notification, et à chaque pourcent de progression pour les notifications contenant une barre de progression (sed4096).
Choix de couleurs plus visibles en mode sombre pour les icônes de fermeture et de repli des notifications en mode sombre (nipos).
Network
Le serveur de réseau se charge de la configuration des interfaces réseau, de la configuration des routes et d’autres aspects liés à la communication en réseau.
Refonte du client DHCP dans net_server pour l’exécuter dans un thread séparé et ne pas bloquer la boucle de messages principale. Cela corrige plusieurs cas de gel du serveur lui-même et d’application qui communiquent avec de façon synchrone, par exemple les préférences de réseau. Cela permet également de plus facilement arrêter les requêtes DHCP lorsqu’une interface est reconfigurée avec une adresse statique (waddlesplash).
app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique gérant l’affichage à l’écran.
Correction de crashs causés par des verrous de concurrence manquants et des opérations effectuées dans le mauvais ordre (waddlesplash).
Retrait d’identifiants de messages qui n’étaient plus utilisés dans le protocole de communication entre les applications et le serveur graphique (X512).
Ajout du code nécessaire pour le tracé de lignes avec un dégradé de couleur (dans app_server et dans BView). Auparavant, les dégradés étaient utilisables uniquement pour le remplissage des formes et pas pour les contours (x512).
Modifications de BPicturePlayer pour utiliser une classe C++ avec de l’héritage plutôt qu’une structure C contenant des pointeurs de fonctions. Cela permet de vérifier que l’interface est implémentée correctement par les différents utilisateurs de cette classe dès la compilation (X512).
Implémentation de méthodes manquantes dans BoundingBox player, une implémentation de BPicturePlayer qui calcule un rectangle assez grand pour contenir tout le dessin réalisé par un objet BPicture rejoué via BPicturePlayer (KapiX).
Retrait d’une optimisation incorrecte dans le traitement des calques avec une opacité globale de 100% dans app_server. Ces calques peuvent tout de même contenir des pixels avec de la transparence, et doivent donc être applatis en tenant compte du canal alpha comme tous les autres calques (KapiX).
Modification du protocole app_server pour l’opération permettant de récupérer les « bounding boxes » pour chaque caractère d’une chaîne. L’interface précédente utilisait un tableau de structures, la nouvelle API est inversée ce qui permet d’envoyer plus efficacement 2 tableaux de types primitifs (X512).
Pilotes de périphériques
Implémentation correcte des timeouts sur les commandes dans le pilote SDHCI, ce qui corrige la compatibilité avec plusieurs lecteurs de cartes SD (PulkoMandy).
Réécriture complète du pilote pour les touchpads Elantech. Cette série de changements retouche tout d’abord la gestion des touchpads en général, avec des améliorations sur la documentation, sur le traitement des données invalides, la configuration par défaut, et un nettoyage du code.
Ensuite, le code pour la reconnaissance de « gestures » a été amélioré pour mieux reconnaître plusieurs mouvements tels que le « tap » pour cliquer, le défilement en faisant glsser 2 doigts sur le touchpad, etc. Les préférences du touchpad ont reçu plusieurs nouvelles cases à cocher pour configurer ces différentes options.
Enfin, la dernière partie du patch met à jour le pilote Elantech pour reconnaître les 4 versions du protocole, dont la dernière est entièrement testée. La version 2 ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant (elle a été désactivée pour l’instant) et les versions 1 et 3 sont activées de façon expérimentale dans les nightly builds en attendant les retours d’utilisateurs (samuelrp84).
Normalisation des noms de volumes générés par le pilote usb_disk pour s’assurer qu’ils ne commencent pas par des espaces (madmax).
Mise à jour de la couche de compatibilité FreeBSD avec FreeBSD 15 et synchronisation de tous les pilotes réseau (ethernet et wifi) concernés avec ceux de FreeBSD 15. Synchronisation du pilote rtl8125 avec OpenBSD (waddlesplash).
Ajout de « quirks » et de code supplémentaire dans le pilote I2C-HID pour essayer de se rapprocher du comportement implémenté dans Linux. Ce pilote ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant et il est désactivé par défaut (Lt-Henry).
Systèmes de fichiers
Ajout d’un bouchon supplémentaire pour une API qui n’a pas besoin d’être implémentée dans userlandfs-FUSE (qui permet l’utilisation de systèmes de fichiers FUSE sous Haiku). Cette modification permet d’utiliser en particulier le système de fichier squashfs-fuse pour accéder à des volumes squashfs (OscarL).
Toujours dans userlandfs-fuse, propagation de l’état « lecture seule » du système de fichier, ce qui permet au Tracker de clairement afficher ces systèmes de fichiers comme étant en lecture seule (fond de fenêtre grisé, désactivation des opérations modifiant les fichiers) (OscarL).
Dans le système de fichiers UDF, amélioration des messages de logs, et correction d’un kernel panic déclenché par une assertion suite à des modifications précédentes dans le VFS (waddlesplash).
Correction d’un double lock dans le pilote FAT qui pouvait déclencher un kernel panic dans de rare cas (Jim906).
Intégration d’une partie des patchs permettant de redimensionner une partition BFS. Ce travail avait été commencé en 2014 dans le cadre du Google Summer of Code mais n’avait pas pu être terminé dans les temps. La série de patch est restée à l’abandon pendant de longues années, mais elle est en train d’être finalisée pour pouvoir en intégrer au moins une première partie (axeld).
Correction d’un bug sur la gestion des timestamps avec un nombre de secondes entier pour BFS. Historiquement dans BeOS, il n’existait pas d’API POSIX pour stocker une date de modification avec une résolution plus fine qu’une seconde. Cela conduisait de très nombreux fichiers à avoir le poids faible de leur date de modification à 0, avec pour conséquence une dégradation de la répartition dans les tables de hachage pour l’exécution de requêtes. Dans ce cas, BFS stocke une valeur aléatoire générée en interne par le système de fichier dans les bits de poids faible. Le bug était que cette valeur pouvait être exposée à l’espace utilisateur, entraînant de mauvais résultats sur la gestion des comparaisons de dates (par exemple pour déterminer les règles à lancer dans un makefile). La représentation interne a été légèrement modifiée pour bien distinguer les fichiers pour lesquels une date précise a été enregistrée, de ceux pour lesquels il s’agit de bits aléatoires. Ces derniers peuvent ainsi être filtrés et masqués pour l’espace utilisateur (PulkoMandy).
Correction de la gestion des dossiers déjà existants dans write_overlay. Ils'agit d’un système de fichier qui permet de stocker en RAM des écritures temporaires sur un système de fichier monté en lecture seule, utilisé en particulier pour l’exécution en mode live CD (nathan242).
Le pilote BTRFS ne déclenche plus un kernel panic lorsqu’il rencontre un type de compression inconnu, à la place, il retourne simplement une erreur et considère que le fichier ou dossier concerné ne peut pas être lu (AbdullahZulfiqar2005).
Des changements sur les requêtes (pour BFS et les autres systèmes de fichiers capables d’exécuter des requêtes): une petite optimisation du code, une modification pour ne pas notifier les suppressions de nœuds via B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL car elles sont déjà notifiées par d’autres moyens. L’API B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL est maintenant considérée comme stable, et a donc été ajoutée dans la documentation officielle (waddlesplash).
libroot &amp; kernel
Réseau
Implémentation des sockets du domaine UNIX de type SOCK_SEQPACKET. Pour ce faire, modifications de recv et send pour accepter des buffers de taille 0 (pour les socket de type datagramme, pas les streams). Implémentation de MSG_TRUNC et MSG_PEEK pour les sockets du domaine UNIX, et amélioration de la gestion des adresses invalides dans accept et recv pour se rapprocher du comportement de Linux et des BSD (korli).
Implémentation de la découverte de MTU de chemin complet pour TCP et IPv4 (waddlesplash) et IPv6 (cmeerw). L’algorithme mis en place est simpliste, mais permet d’établir des communications dans des cas où le MTU est limité et la fragmentation de paquets n’est pas mise en place.
Nettoyage des buffers mémoire utilisés pour stocker des adresses dans le code de gestion du réseau. Cela corrige un comportement incorrect dans le cas où une adresse de socket UNIX n’est pas terminée par un caractère NUL (cas qui est explicitement autorisé sous Linux car l’information de longueur de l’adresse est disponible par ailleurs) (Anarchos pour la correction du cas où la vérification était oubliée, suivi d’un nettoyage par waddlesplash pour avoir une solution plus systématique à tous les endroits où ce cas particulier doit être pris en compte).
Un socket TCP qui est fermé alors que des données sont reçues par le noyau mais pas encore lues par l’application associée renvoie un paquet RST plutôt qu’un FIN. Ceci corrige un problème détecté dans les tests du langage Go. Modification du comportement lors de la réception d’un reset pendant la fermeture d’un socket TCP pour se comporter comme les autres systèmes (korli).
Déplacement du fichier networks utiliser par getnetent dans le dossier data, avec les autres fichiers de configuration du réseau. Il était placé par erreur dans /etc, qui est son chemin habituel pour d’autres systèmes UNIX (PulkoMandy).
Report d’une correction faite par NetBSD dans le résolveur DNS, il manquait une partie de l’initialisation de certains objets dans l’état du résolveur (cmeerw).
Gestion de l’IPv6: correction d’un problème dans la mise à jour du cache pour le protocole NDP (neighbor discovery), implémentation du multicast (cmeerw).
Remplacement des fonctions inet_net_ntop et inet_net_pton par l’implémentation d’OpenBSD, qui est plus respectueuse du standard que celle de NetBSD utilisée auparavant (korli).
Gestion des processus
Autorisation de l’appel de exec() depuis un autre thread que le thread principal du processus, pour se mettre en conformité avec POSIX et corriger un problème avec les outils de compilation d’OCaml (korli).
Préservation des signaux masqués lors de l’appel à fork (korli).
Mise en conformité POSIX des codes d’erreurs retournés dans certains cas dans la gestion des groupes de processus (waddlesplash).
Librairie C standard
Mise en conformité POSIX-2024:
Ajout des fonctions ffsl et ffsll dans strings.h (korli)
Ajout de getresuid(), setresuid(), getresgid(), setresgid() (korli)
Ajout de la déclaration de posix_spawn_file_actions_add[f]chdir dans les en-têtes publics (la fonction était déjà implémentée mais pas déclarée) (waddlesplash)
Synchronisation de l’implémentation de arc4random avec la dernière version d’OpenBSD (korli).
Correction d’un bug dans la gestion des locales, il n’était pas possible de changer seulement certaines catégories (date, format monétaire, messages), tout était forcément dans la même langue (waddlesplash).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans la famille de fonctions strftime (waddlesplash):
ajout des formats %k et %l,
correction sur la gestion des caractères d'espacement Unicode,
correction de problèmes sur la gestion des fuseaux horaires.
Correction de problèmes mineur de compatibilité POSIX: ajout de déclarations de fonctions et de constantes dans search.h, unistd.h, semaphore.h, nettoyage dans limits.h, définition de getlocalename_l… (waddlesplash).
Remplacement de strtok_r par l’implémentation de musl (waddlesplash).
Refonte du stockage et de la gestion des données ctype pour rendre le code plus facile à maintenir, supprimer des indirections inutiles et corriger un problème de thread safety (waddlesplash).
Nettoyage des fonctions de conversions d’encodage de caractères, et correction de la valeur de MB_CUR_MAX pour l’encodage UTF-8 (waddlesplash).
Définition de la constante DEV_BSIZE (mentionnée dans POSIX mais pas obligatoire) dans sys/param.h, modification de tous le code utilisant stat.st_blocks pour utiliser cette constante, y compris des problèmes dans certains systèmes de fichiers qui utilisaient st_blksize à la place. En effet, il n’y a aucun rapport entre la taille de bloc de st_blksize et le nombre de blocs de st_blocks défini juste à côté (waddlesplash).
Gestion de la mémoire
Correction d’une régression du mois précédent sur la gestion des réservations de mémoire lors du découpage d’areas`. Ajout de la possibilité de transférer des réservations de pages pour les caches et areas réservés, pour éviter de réduire les réservations de façon incorrecte. Cela pouvait causer des assertions et des plantages du noyau en particulier lors de l’exécution d’applications utilisant AddressSanitizer (waddlesplash).
Correction d’une fuite de mémoire dans… la gestion de la mémoire, mis en évidence entre autres par l’exécution du compilateur Rust qui consomme beaucoup de mémoire. Au passage, nettoyage du code et des messages de logs dans cette partie du code (waddlesplash).
Entrées-sorties
Modification de la gestion des requêtes d’entrées-sortie pour autoriser les pilotes de périphériques à sous-classer IORequestOwner. En particulier, cela permet au pilote NVMe d’utiliser ces fonctionnalités sans passer par l’ordonnanceur d’I/O générique qui ne se prête pas bien à l’interfaçage de matériel pouvant traiter plusieurs requêtes en parallèle. Cela permet de simplifier du code, supprimer une fonction récursive devenue inutile et finalement corriger un débordement de pile (waddlesplash).
La taille des partitions indiquée dans le bootloader n’était pas correcte : c’était la taille du disque entier qui était affichée à la place (waddlesplash).
Chargeur de démarrage
Correction de l’affichage de caractères unicode dans le menu de démarrage. En particulier cela évite de corrompre l’affichage lors de la navigation dans le système de fichiers pour désactiver certains pilotes de périphériques. Le firmware UEFI utilise de l’UTF16, tandis que le BIOS utilise une page de code IBM non standardisée. Le bootloader utilise en interne de l’UTF-8 et doit donc convertir les caractères dans le bon format dans chaque cas (madmax).
Implémentation du démarrage via le réseau sur les plateformes EFI (avec un peu de nettoyage sur le support réseau dans OpenFirmware et PXE). Cela fonctionne au moins sur l’architecture ARM 32-bit et facilite le développement sur cible réelle: compilation sur une machine, et exécution sur une autre sans devoir entretemps copier le système de fichiers et le bootloader sur une clé USB ou une carte SD (kallisti5 et PulkoMandy).
Un des en-têtes du bootloader utilisait une syntaxe C++, il a été corrigé pour pouvoir être importé depuis du code C si nécessaire (beaglejoe).
Le chargeur EFI ignore les disques qui ont une taille de bloc de 0 octet, ce qui évite une division par zéro lors de tentatives de lire des données (archeYR).
Systèmes de fichiers
Le noyau interdit maintenant de monter plusieurs fois la même partition. Cette vérification avait d’abord été implémentée dans le pilote FAT, puis via une vérification en espace utilisateur, mais ces deux protections étaient insuffisantes et causaient d’autres problèmes (waddlesplash).
Centralisation de plusieurs vérifications au niveau du VFS, par exemple les vérifications de type fichier ou dossier, les modes d’ouverture des fichiers, des codes d’erreurs retournés pour certaines erreurs spécifiques. Ces changements évitent d’avoir des différences de comportement entre différents systèmes de fichiers et s’assurent que le comportement implémenté est bien celui spécifié par POSIX (waddlesplash).
Implémentation de « fallbacks » pour les systèmes de fichiers qui ne savent pas traiter eux-mêmes les opérations SEEK_DATA, SEEK_HOLE et select(), dont en particulier le write_overlay. Cela permet à la commande cp de fonctionner correctement dans ce cas (nathan242).
Outils de debug
Remise en commun de code pour la gestion du MMU dans le chargeur de démarrage EFI. Le code avait été dupliqué pour chaque architecture de CPU supportés, mais il est en fait en très grande partie identique. Regrouper ce code permet de s’assurer que les évolutions sont bien faites de façon synchronisée pour toutes les architectures (PulkoMandy).
Affichage dans le message de kernel panic de la version de Haiku (numéro hrev). Ceci évite de devoir demander ce numéro aux utilisateurs remontant un bug, il est directement inclus dans la capture d’écran de l’erreur (nathan242).
Modification de la valeur retournée par kernel_version dans les informations système. La valeur retournée par Haiku était la version majeure, qui est 1 depuis le début du projet Haiku en 2001. Elle retourne maintenant une version plus complète qui peut être utilisée dans la commande uname pour indiquer la version de Haiku plus précisément (waddlesplash).
Désactivation de la fonction spécifique à BeOS exect sur les architectures qui n’implémentent pas de compatibilité binaire avec BeOS.
Build system
Ajout d’une macro _DEPRECATED dans les en-têtes de base du système, permettant d’indiquer les classes, méthodes et fonctions qui sont obsolètes et à ne plus utiliser. Cela permet d’avoir un avertissement du compilateur lors de leur utilisation dans le code existant, et de commencer à mettre à jour le code, mais sans casser le code déjà écrit pour l’instant. Actuellement, cette macro n’est pas utilisée, des discussions sont encore en cours sur l’opportunité de retirer certaines APIs.
Remise en état des tests pour le bootloader. Ces tests permettent de lancer une partie du bootloader (dont le menu de configuration) sous forme d’un programme s’exécutant sous Haiku. Cela permet de tester une grande partie du code du bootloader sans avoir besoin de redémarrer le système (waddlesplash).
Ajout d’un script pour convertir une disposition de clavier de la console Linux dans le format reconnu par Haiku (mmu_man).
Mise à jour de paquets pour réparer la compilation en mode « bootstrap » (sans dépendances précompilées) pour ARM et ARM64 (PulkoMandy).
Nettoyage et amélioration de la classe utilitaire FunctionTracer qui permet d’afficher facilement une trace de l’exécution de fonctions, avec une indentation indiquant les appels imbriqués. Il existait plusieurs versions de cette classe utilisées à différents endroits dans le code, chacune avec de légères variations. Renommage de fonctions qui pouvaient entrer en conflit avec l’utilisation de debug_printf et modification de cette dernière pour retourner le nombre de caractères imprimés afin de pouvoir l’utiliser de façon interchangeable avec les autres fonctions de la famille printf (PulkoMandy).
Déplacement de plusieurs en-têtes initialement développés pour une utilisation dans le noyau, de headers/private/kernel/util vers headers/private/util, en effet ils implémentent des fonctionnalités assez génériques (listes chaînées, hash tables, opérations sur les bits…) et sont tout à fait utilisables en dehors du noyau (c’est d’ailleurs déjà le cas à plusieurs endroits dans le code de Haiku) (PulkoMandy et waddlesplash).
Retrait de cas ou l’activation de DEBUG=1 (compilation en mode debug avec des assertions supplémentaires) était empêchée pour certains composants du code (waddlesplash).
Modification du code pour inclure les catalogues de traductions automatiquement dans le paquet contenant l’exécutable correspondant. Ce code incluait également les catalogues de toutes les dépendances, ce qui conduisait les catalogues système de libbe.so à être présents plusieurs fois dans plusieurs paquets, occupant inutilement de la place). Ce changement n’est pas tout à fait terminé puisque maintenant certains catalogues ne sont plus inclus du tout (PulkoMandy).
Modernisation de la page d’accueil de WebPositive pour en permettre l’utilisation avec d’autres navigateurs: définition du bon type MIME, utilisation de HTTPS pour télécharger des ressources externes, déclaration de l’encodage du fichier (humbinger).
Modification du « Makefile Engine » pour autoriser des flags de compilation différents entre les fichiers sources C et C++, ce qui permet d’éviter des warnings de compilation dans certains projets compilant des sources C (OscarL).
Il est maintenant possible de compiler Haiku depuis NetBSD (cmeerw).
Réparation de la compilation de test_app_server (KapiX).
Utilisation de la constante B_DEV_NAME_LENGTH plutôt que de la valeur numérique 128 à plusieurs endroits dans le code (jscipione et OscarL).
Suppression de la dépendance du build à la commande bc, en utilisant à la place des expressions arithmétiques du shell POSIX (PulkoMandy).
Réparation de la compilation des tests unitaires, modification des tests utilisant l’interface graphique pour les exécuter avec test_app_server, ajout d’un package haiku_unittests et d’un profil de build qui inclut ce package dans le système de fichier compilé. L’objectif est de pouvoir lancer ces tests automatiquement dans le cadre de l’intégration continue de Haiku (KapiX, à partir d’un travail plus ancien démarré par kallisti5).
Mise à jour de l’année de copyright à 2026 dans le menu de démarrage et dans les métadonnées des paquets générés par Haiku (PulkoMandy).
Mise à jour des paquets précompilés utilisés pour compiler Haiku avec les dernières versions fournies par HaikuPorts pour les architectures x86 et x86_64. L’outil utilisé pour faire cette synchronisation a reçu lui-même quelques évolutions. Le code de Haiku a été légèrement ajusté pour corriger les problèmes de compilation avec ces nouvelles versions des dépendances (waddlesplash, avec l’aide de madmax pour corriger des problèmes de compilation sur RISC-V qui utilise pour l’instant une version plus ancienne de certains paquets).
Documentation
Haiku book
Le « Haiku book » documente les API publiques et s’adresse aux développeurs d’applications pour Haiku. Il complète et remplace petit à petit le Be Book de BeOS, qui est distribué sous une licence CC-BY-ND ne permettant pas de le mettre à jour et de le corriger.
Ajout du chapitre sur le Device Kit (DigitalBox98)
Correction d’une documentation inversée pour un paramètre de BKeyStore (PulkoMandy)
Ajout de documentation pour BSimpleGameSound, BSerialPort, MailAttachment, MailDaemon, mail_encoding (cafeina)
Documentation des déviations connues de Haiku par rapport à la spécification POSIX (PulkoMandy).
Documentation interne
La documentation interne s’adresse aux développeurs et développeuses du système Haiku lui-même.
Correction de fautes de frappe dans le chapitre sur les systèmes de fichiers (OscarL).
Autres nouvelles
Changement de tarification de Netlify
Netlify héberge le site www.haiku-os.org. Ils ont récemment modifié leur tarification pour ajouter un système de crédit en fonction de la bande passante consommée. Haiku bénéficie de l’offre « Open Source », avec une certaine quantité de trafic offerte (en échange de l’affichage d’un logo de Netlify en base de page du site). Cette offre s’est révélée insuffisante dans la nouvelle tarification, surtout suite à une attaque de robots (probablement pour l’entraînement de LLM de mauvaise qualité, puisque ils requêtaient des pages n’existant pas et n’obtenaient que des erreurs 404). Du côté de Haiku, des protections ont été mises en place pour éviter ce genre de problème, mais entretemps, Netlify a facturé le dépassement de bande passante autorisée pour le mois de décembre.
Finalement, après une discussion avec l’équipe de support de Netlify et une vérification de ce qu’il s’était passé, la facture a été annulée, et la consommation de bande passante pour Haiku a été augmentée pour mieux convenir à l’utilisation habituelle générée par Haiku.
Remise sur les rails de HSA (Haiku Support Association)
Actuellement, l’association Haiku inc est la principale organisation recevant des dons et finançant les activités de Haiku (développeur employé, coût d’hébergement de l’infrastructure…).
Cette association est basée aux USA, ce qui est récemment devenu une source d’inquiétude pour certains contributeurs et donateurs de Haiku.
Suite à une discussion sur les forums, il y a donc un regain d’intérêt pour la Haiku Support Association, une autre organisation basée en Allemagne et qui était dormante depuis plusieurs années. Plusieurs personnes ont donc adhéré à cette association et cela va peut-être permettre d’en relancer l’activité et d’assurer une présence en Europe.
En particulier, c’est cette association qui organisait la conférence BeGeistert et le traditionnel « coding sprint » associé, permettant aux développeurs et aux utilisateurs de Haiku de se rencontrer régulièrement. Cette activité avait cessé suite au manque de public pour ces évènements, à une perte d’intérêt des membres de l’association, et une absence de nouveaux adhérents pour relancer les choses. Espérons que cette période d’inactivité soit maintenant terminée et que l’organisation de conférences plus régulières puisse reprendre.

### 6. `FR` [L’ANSSI révise sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre](data/articles/8a512e5cc7bbd13459cb5362176c6f21.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) vient de publier une mise à jour substantielle de sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre. L’agence confirme que le logiciel libre et la transparence sont essentiels à la sécurité des systèmes d’information. Elle assume sa contribution au libre et la publication de logiciels sous licence libre.
Cette posture très favorable au logiciel libre et open source est une belle avancée et un signal fort. Jusque-là, la posture de l’ANSSI était beaucoup plus floue et sa contribution à des projets libres et open source pouvait même apparaitre en contradiction avec sa doctrine. J’avais l’impression que les collaborateurs de l’ANSSI qui le faisaient reprenaient à leur compte le dicton « Pour vivre heureux, vivons cachés ».
La politique de l’agence est désormais claire : l’ANSSI contribue, l’ANSSI publie, l’ANSSI a une stratégie pragmatique qui peut l’amener à s’engager ou non sur le long terme en fonction de la finalité de l’outil et des motivations de l’ANSSI.
Détail qui a son importance, l’ANSSI indique privilégier, sauf exception justifiée, la licence Apache v2.0 pour les projets qu’elle publie. Je suis ravi de voir ce service privilégier une licence mondialement connue à une licence franco-française ou européenne (elles ont le don de doucher nombre de velléités d’utilisation et de contribution). lien nᵒ 1 : L’ANSSI met à jour sa politique open source (9 février 2026)

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’association Drupal France &amp; Francophonie organise la 13ème édition du Drupalcamp les 9, 10 et 11 avril 2026 au campus Universitaire Grenoble Alpes de Grenoble (France, Isère 38). Drupal est « un système de gestion de contenu (CMS) libre et open-source publié sous la licence publique générale GNU et écrit en PHP ».
Après Rennes en 2024, puis un Barcamp à Perpignan en 2025, cette année 2026 nous emmène au pied des montagnes à Grenoble pour un format de 3 jours de rencontres, soit deux journées de conférences les jeudi et vendredi. La journée du samedi est réservée à la contribution.
Des moments d’ateliers et micro-formation sont également au programme, pour faire de cet évènement une réussite d’un point de vue communauté autour du projet Open Source Drupal.
Le Drupalcamp Grenoble c’est la rencontre de la communauté francophone autour du logiciel libre Drupal. Ouvert à toutes et tous, les rencontres, conférences et ateliers permettent d’adresser à un public toujours plus large des sujets et thématiques diversifiées.
Notre objectif principal est de rendre la création de sites plus simple et la gestion des contenus plus intuitive pour tous. Comme de fédérer les utilisateurs et professionnels qui utilisent Drupal au quotidien.
Du simple curieux au développeur expert, tous ceux qui s’intéressent à Drupal et aux logiciels libres pourront participer à cette manifestation rythmée par :
des conférences (jeudi 9 et vendredi 10 avril), données par des professionnels reconnus et des membres de la communauté Drupal au cours desquels des thématiques nouvelles seront explorées,
des sessions de découverte étayées par des démonstrations à l’intention d’un public plus néophyte,
une journée de formation gratuite (Drupal in a Day) dédiée à l’initiation pour que les curieux puissent se lancer dans la création de leur premier site (sur inscription)
des moments de réseautage et de convivialité avec, notamment, la très attendue soirée communautaire !

Utilisateur de Canoprof depuis 2019, cet outil est devenu un des piliers de ma pratique d’enseignement en Physique-Chimie (4ᵉ, 5ᵉ, 3ᵉ) et en Sciences (6ᵉ). Je l’utilise pour concevoir l’ensemble de mes supports aussi bien papier que numériques, ce qui me permet de maintenir une cohérence didactique forte sur l’ensemble du cursus collège.
La force de Canoprof réside dans la séparation claire entre le contenu et la forme. En tant qu’enseignant, cela me permet de me concentrer sur le fond pédagogique et la structuration de mes séquences, sans perdre de temps dans les contraintes techniques de mise en page. La richesse de mon fond documentaire, construit depuis plus de six ans, évolue ainsi sereinement au fil des réformes et de mes retours d’expérience.
Canoprof m’aide à formaliser une progression spiralaire efficace tout en générant des supports propres, structurés et accessibles. C’est un gain de productivité précieux qui me permet de consacrer plus d’énergie à l’accompagnement de mes élèves en classe. Guillaume Marmin, enseignant de physique-chimie au Collège Isabelle Autissier. Modèle utilisé : Canoprof Rencontres Scenari 2026 à l’ENSAM Aix-en-Provence 22-26 juin Les Rencontres Scenari 2026 auront lieu du lundi 22 juin (midi) au vendredi 26 juin (midi) sous le soleil provençal à l'ENSAM Aix-en-Provence.
Bloque ces dates dès maintenant, les détails seront précisés bientôt. Tu peux parler de Scenari aux conférences éclair de l’April ? Lors de la prochaine assemblée générale de l’April (samedi 28 mars 2026 à Paris) il y aura un temps de conférences éclairs (6 minutes) de 10h à 12h qui s’enchaîneront sur des sujets variés, en lien avec le Libre, entendu au sens large.
Si tu utilises Scenari, c’est une bonne opportunité pour parler de tes usages auprès des adhérent⋅e⋅s de l’April. Date limite pour proposer : 15 mars. Envoyer un courriel à confseclairs@april.org.
Il n’est pas nécessaire d’être adhérent⋅e à l’April pour pouvoir proposer une conférence éclair.
Plus de détails sur l’annonce de l’April. Nouvel habillage web pour Optim 24 Un nouvel habillage graphique pour Optim 24 fait son apparition sur la plateforme de téléchargement.
Il existe pour tous les supports web des 3 modalités d’Optim : site normal, site web simple, site web en tuiles. Mise-à-jour de Myscenari MyScenari vient de passer en version 6.4.5 (corrections de bugs dans le cœur et dans les modèles en version 25). Attention : cette version est la dernière à contenir Dokiel 5 et 6, Opale 5 et 24, Optim 3 À partir de la prochaine mise à jour de MyScenari, nous n’aurons plus que Dokiel 25, Opale 25, Optim 24. Pense à migrer tes modèles (et skins) pour ne pas être pris⋅e au dépourvu au dernier moment. Nouvelles versions d’outils Scenari Opale, le modèle phare pour créer vos contenus pédagogiques, passe en version 25.1.1. Au menu, entre autres : corrections dans les outils d’accessibilité, et amélioration de l’intégration de MindMap dans la publication Diapo. Et Opale est maintenant disponible en allemand ! Parcours, pour concevoir des conducteurs pédagogiques, passe en version 25.0.2 (corrections mineures sur le skin, l’éditeur et les vidéos HLS) et est disponible maintenant en français et Anglais. Dokiel, le modèle pour la documentation technique et logicielle, passe en version 25.0.6. Cette version apporte entre autres des corrections dans la publication de relecture et l’écran de contrôle, et l’amélioration des écrans décrits dans les publications Web (maintenant responsive). Optim monte en version dans ses deux saveurs Optim 24.0.7 et OptimPlus 24.0.3 avec des corrections mineures sur les publications Web et Diaporama, et dans le styage. LTI-suite, le serveur pour exploiter des ressources SCORM dans des LMS via LTI, passe en version 2.0.3. Lexico, votre modèle pour créer des lexiques, glossaires, thesaurus, vocabulaires, monte en version 25.0.1 pour apporter des corrections mineures dans la publication Web. SCENARIchain-desktop est à présent disponible en français, en anglais et en espagnol. Le savais-tu ?
En contexte d’ateliers complexes (plusieurs calques de dérivation et/ou de travail), les détails dans le bandeau de l’item listent les variantes de cet item dans les autres ateliers calques ou de travail, s’il en existe.
Dans l’exemple ci-dessous, l’item _Module-LeThe.xml dans l’atelier maître (icone d’atelier bleu) est modifié dans un atelier de travail (icone d’atelier vert) et modifié aussi dans un atelier dérivé (icone d’atelier marron). On peut passer facilement d’une version à l’autre en un seul clic. La popup est détachable pour plus d’aisance si besoin.
Exemple Le chiffre du mois 20, c’est le nombre d’années qui se sont écoulées depuis la première sortie d’Opale le 18/09/2006 (les développements avaient commencé en novembre 2005). Nouvelles adhésions d’organisations

**Source:** Phoronix | **Keyword:** `Benchmarks`
When beginning some early Linux 7.0 kernel benchmarking this week for looking at its performance in its early development state, I started off testing on Core Ultra X7 "Panther Lake" in being hopeful for better performance with the maturing Arc B390 Xe3 graphics and the like. But I ended up finding Intel Panther Lake seeing some performance regressions on Linux 7.0. So next up I turned to an AMD EPYC Turin server since if regressions existed there at least it's much faster to carry out bisecting of the kernel performance regressions. But with that initial testing wrapped up, I didn't find any regressions like with Panther Lake and standing out were some rather enticing PostgreSQL database server performance benefits when running atop Linux 7.0.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Physiocab est un logiciel libre de gestion de cabinet de kinésithérapie, développé sous licence Affero GPL 3.0 et hébergé sur Codeberg. Le projet est porté par la société Allium SAS, dans le cadre de la plateforme communautaire Kalinka, dédiée aux kinésithérapeutes francophones.
Le projet vient de passer en beta publique (v0.9) et cherche des testeurs et contributeurs.
Pourquoi un logiciel libre pour les kinés ? Le secteur de la santé libérale souffre d'une offre logicielle dominée par des solutions propriétaires onéreuses, souvent opaques sur le traitement des données de santé. Physiocab propose une alternative : un code auditable, des données stockées localement sous la responsabilité du praticien. lien nᵒ 1 : La page de présentation du projet
lien nᵒ 2 : Le dépôt codeberg
lien nᵒ 3 : PeerJs (MIT) Fonctionnalités
La beta couvre déjà un large périmètre fonctionnel :
Planning hebdomadaire en drag &amp; drop, avec export PDF et gestion des semaines exceptionnelles, particulièrement orienté vers les kinés intervenant en multi-établissements.
Bilans Diagnostiques Kinésithérapiques (BDK) avec tests standardisés (TUG, Tinetti, Handgrip, EVA, évaluation du risque de chute…), export de PDF et historique comparatif.
Suivi des séances avec de multiples exercices structurés (équilibre, force, endurance, mobilisation), chronométrage automatique et calcul de progression.
Application tablette en PWA : fonctionne hors connexion grâce à un Service Worker, s'installe sans passer par un store, interface optimisée tactile.
Stack technique
Backend : Python 3.10+
L'application est multi-plateforme côté client (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). La communication entre l'appli de bureau et l'appli PWA se fait de manière directe via PeerJs. Cette méthode ne nécessite pas de préparation contraignante comme l'ouverture de ports.
Les données sont stockées localement, ce qui implique que le praticien reste maître de ses sauvegardes et de sa conformité RGPD.
Le logiciel a été testé par un kinésithérapeute en situation réelle plusieurs jours d'affilée.
Modèle économique
L'utilisation est gratuite, sans limite dans le temps et sans frais cachés, la licence Affero GPL 3.0 en étant la garantie. Un support payant sur devis est proposé pour les praticiens souhaitant une installation assistée, une formation à distance, des développements sur mesure ou un audit de sécurité.

Various forms of tools, colloquially known as "AI", have been
rapidly pervading all aspects of open-source development. Many
developers are embracing LLM tools for code creation and review. Some project maintainers complain about suffering from a deluge of slop-laden pull
requests, as well as fabricated bug and security
reports. Too many projects are reeling from scraperbot attacks that
effectively DDoS important infrastructure. But an AI bot flaming an
open-source maintainer was not on our bingo card for 2026; that seemed
a bit too far-fetched. However, it appears that is just what happened
recently after a project rejected a bot-driven pull request.

34 ans après sa première version, Vim prouve qu’il reste un pilier incontournable de l’écosystème open source. Le projet a publié le vendredi 13 février 2026 la version 9.2 de son célèbre éditeur de texte. Il s’agit de la première mise à jour majeure depuis janvier 2024, marquant une étape importante dans la continuité du projet après le décès de son créateur Bram Moolenaar en 2023. Cette version n’est pas qu’une simple correction de bugs, car elle apporte des fonctionnalités de modernité réclamées de longue date par la communauté. Tour d’horizon !
Un support natif de Wayland et des dossiers plus propres
La grande nouveauté de cette version est l’arrivée du support expérimental de Wayland. Vous pouvez désormais profiter de l’intégration native du presse-papiers système sans avoir besoin de plugins tiers, car Vim communique directement avec les serveurs d’affichage modernes de Linux.
Parallèlement, Vim 9.2 adopte enfin la spécification XDG Base Directory. Si vous en avez assez de voir votre dossier personnel encombré par les fichiers .vimrc et .vim, vous allez apprécier ce changement, car l’éditeur peut désormais stocker sa configuration dans $HOME/.config/vim.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
En février, il y a la corvée commerciale de la Saint-Valentin et les réjouissances intellectuelles consécutives à la sortie d’une nouvelle version de la suite bureautique LibreOffice. C’est, bien évidemment, sur LibreOffice 26.2 que l’on va se pencher. Au menu, du très visible, comme les boites de dialogues, du très attendu comme la prise en compte du Markdown ou du moins visible comme le travail sur l’accessibilité.
Il va de soi que les notes de version sont plus exhaustives et qu’il ne s’agit ici que d’une sélection. lien nᵒ 1 : Notes de version Sommaire
L’accessibilité
Support du Markdown
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Writer
Calc
En vrac
Pour finir
Avant de commencer : toutes les captures d’écran ont été faites, volontairement, sur une interface très personnalisée.
L’accessibilité
L’accessibilité de la suite bureautique est un important chantier pour lequel une personne a été recrutée en 2023 (en). Cette version-ci a fait l’objet d’améliorations sensibles. Parallèlement, Sophie Gautier, coordinatrice de The Document Foundation1 (Foundation coordinator) est en train de monter un groupe de travail qui a pour objectif la publication d’un rapport de conformité en matière d’accessibilité pour répondre à la norme européenne EN 301 549 (en) d’accessiblité numérique. La langue de travail de ce groupe est l’anglais.
Concernant les améliorations de cette version :
la boite de dialogue « Vérifier les mises à jour », Aide &gt; Vérifier les mises à jour… est devenue accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
les fonctions d’accessibilité des aperçus des bordures, onglet « Bordures » des boites de dialogue, ont été revues afin qu’elles ne perturbent plus les dispositifs d’assistance ;
sur Linux : la boite de dialogue Outils&gt; Orthographe est annoncée correctement par le lecteur d’écran ;
quand on supprimait la sélection accessible, le curseur se déplaçait automatiquement au début du texte, ce comportement perturbant est supprimé ;
dans Writer, les fautes d’orthographe ne sont plus signalées par les dispositifs d’assistance si la vérification orthographique n’est pas activée ;
l’accessibilité au clavier de la boite de dialogue des extensions : Outils &gt; Extensions est accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
et enfin, il est possible de naviguer entre les onglets verticaux avec des raccourcis clavier.
Support du Markdown
Le Markdown est devenu le format de balisage léger standard « de fait ». Et c’est celui supporté par LinuxFR. Son support a été introduit dans cette version, c’est un des formats d’enregistrement qui s’est ajouté à la série des autres formats de la suite, pas un format d’export. Pour l’utiliser pour vos sites, passant pour LinuxFR, vous devrez :
soit ouvrir le fichier .md dans un éditeur de texte, n’importe lequel, même Mousepad fait l’affaire par exemple, et copier-coller ensuite le tout à partir de l’éditeur de texte là où vous le voulez ;
soit, si cela est possible, importer le fichier .md dans ce qui vous sert pour gérer le site comme le fait par exemple l’extension ODT2SPIP pour le système de gestion de contenu SPIP qui permet de créer une nouvelle page dans SPIP avec un fichier.ODT. ça marche avec LinuxFR ? Plutôt bien. Les styles de caractère Accentuation (ici en italiques) et Accentuation forte (ici gras) sont bien reconnu ainsi que Texte source pour « télétype », les indications in-texte encadrées de l’accent grave U+0060. Les styles de paragraphes :
Bloc de citation (paragraphes de citation précédés d’une ligne blanche et du signe « &gt; » dans la saisie de contenu sur LinuxFR) ;
Contenu de tableau ;
Corps de texte ;
Liste, par contre la numérotation des listes ordonnée ne semble pas bien fonctionner, il faut saisir les numéros à la main ;
Texte préformaté pour écrire des blocs de code ;
Titre 1, Titre 2, Titre 3 et Titre de tableau.
Les tableaux sont bien repris ainsi que les liens insérés via l’insertion d’hyperliens.
Ce qui ne semble pas fonctionner du tout : ce sont les notes, elles disparaissent corps et biens. C’est peut-être dû au passage dans l’éditeur de texte qui transforme un peu le document. Et, évidemment, il faut rajouter les images avec la syntaxe LinuxFR.
La version de Mardown de LibreOffice est CommonMark (en) et la bibliothèque utilisée est MD4C avec quelques extensions prises en charge par cette bibliothèque (cf ce rapport de bug (en) et ses réponses), pour en savoir plus, voir cette note (en) du blog de The Document Foundation.
Petite remarque, si vous utilisez un LibreOffice 25.8, vous avez peut-être pu constater qu’il était question d’enregistrement au format .md, cette information a été ajoutée trop précocement car la version 25.8 ne gère pas le Markdown.
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Les boites de dialogue, notamment de styles et de formats, ont beaucoup changé. Longtemps elles se sont affichées avec une présentation par onglets en haut et le contenu dessous.
Puis il y a une période de transition en 2025 qui a fait grincer une collection complète de dents où on avait, selon l’endroit où on était, soit des onglets soit une navigation par menu latéral. Cette dernière avait un gros défaut : par exemple pour la configuration des styles dans Writer il fallait descendre tout en bas pour accéder aux options qui étaient cachées. Et il n’y avait pas de barre de défilement pour aller plus vite.
LibreOffice 26.2 voit ces défauts corrigés : les boites de dialogue sont harmonisées dans toute la suite et leur menu latéral, toujours sans barre de défilement qui s’avère finalement inutile, montre clairement tous les types de paramètres auxquels on peut accéder. Et, comme on peut le voir, LibreOffice a intégré une meilleure prise en charge des systèmes d’écritures asiatiques et complexes en affichant deux colonnes, une pour les polices occidentales, ou pour les polices asiatiques ou complexes. Une personne a également été recrutée en 2023 (en) pour travailler sur le support des systèmes d’écriture de droite à gauche (RTL) et complexes (CTL). Si toutefois, vous préférez revenir à l’affichage avec les onglets, il suffit d’aller dans le menu Outils &gt; Options &gt; Apparenceau niveau de « Boites de dialogue » et cocher l’option Horizontal en haut. Il faut savoir que les onglets en haut ne s’affichent que sur une seule ligne et qu’il faudra donc naviguer avec les flèches quand il y a de nombreuses options. Writer
Il y a un certain nombre d’amélioration autour de la compatibilité avec le format DOCX : séparation de tableaux flottants en plusieurs tableaux, suppression de la numérotation des notes de bas de page à l’ouverture d’un fichier DOCX, etc.
On relèvera deux nouvelles options d’alignement des paragraphes : « Début » et « Fin ». Si vous utilisez l’alphabet latin, vous ne verrez aucune différence avec les deux options « Forcer à gauche/en haut » et « Forcer à droite/en bas ». Elles ont été développées pour réutiliser plus facilement les styles entre les divers systèmes d’écriture. Pour continuer sur la lancée du travail pour la prise en compte des systèmes d’écriture dont le fonctionnement est différent de celui de l’alphabet latin, il est possible de changer la direction du texte : de gauche à droite ou de droite à gauche en cours de travail. Cela peut se paramétrer dans les styles. Calc
Un gros travail sur les performances a été fait : vitesse de défilement, rapidité des classeurs avec de nombreuses formes et du rejet des modifications. On voit apparaître de nouvelles options de tri (Données &gt;Trier) qui dépendent de la « locale » (langue définie dans les Options de LibreOffice). On peut ainsi déterminer quel caractère est utilisé comme séparateur de décimal pour le tri naturel. On peut relever aussi une avancée ergonomique qui va plaire à toutes celles et ceux qui utilisent les matrices, on peut maintenant modifier les formules matricielles avec la combinaison de touches : F2 + ↑ Maj + Ctrl + Entrée, il n’est plus nécessaire de modifier la formule elle-même.
Et aussi : si vous utilisez (pourquoi diable ?) le format d’enregistrement XLSX, c’est le format EXCEL2010+ qui est le format par défaut, il change de nom pour devenir « Classeur Excel 2010-365 ».2
En vrac
Base est devenu complètement multi-utilisateur, TDF a, d’ailleurs, recruté une personne pour travailler sur l’application.
Concernant les diagrammes (ou chart) : dans le Volet latéral, quand le graphique est en mode modification et que l’on va, au niveau de « Couleurs », sur la palette, on a une prévisualisation en direct dans le diagramme ce qui permet de tester le choix de couleurs plus facilement.
Les polices embarquées dont la licence ne permettait pas l’édition étaient jusqu’à présent ignorées et remplacées à l’affichage, ni vu, ni connu par une fonte de substitution. Ce défaut a été corrigé.
L’export PDF gère les liens avec les documents externes : Fichier &gt; Exporter au format PDF &gt; Liens. Les dictionnaires hongrois, mongol et portugais du Portugal ont été mis à jour ainsi que les règles de césure de la langue hongroise.
JSON, pour JavaScript Object Notation, est un format standard utilisé pour représenter des données structurées. Il est utilisé notamment pour échanger les informations entre un navigateur et un serveur. C’est, par exemple, le format de sauvegarde des marques-pages de Firefox ou de certains fichiers d’archives de Mastodon. Les documents XML et JSON génériques avec des plages pouvant être liées sont maintenant automatiquement mappés à des feuilles dans Calc. Une plage pouvant être liée est une section d’un document contenant des enregistrements tabulaires. Lorsqu’un document contient plusieurs plages pouvant être liées, chaque plage est mappée à une seule feuille3.
Et si vous avez envie de vous amuser avec les fonctions expérimentales (à activer dansOutils &gt; Options &gt; LibreOffice &gt; Avancé), vous pouvez jouer avec la nouvelle de boite de dialogue « Gestion des macros ».
Pour finir
Cette dépêche a, bien, évidemment, été rédigée avec LibreOffice et, cette fois-ci dans un fichier enregistré en Markdown. Les seules balises que j’ai dû entrer à la main sont celles des images. Kate a l’air de modifier le fichier et, quand je réouvre le .md dans LibreOffice, il y a des styles qui ont sauté mais la mise en forme reste visuellement la même. Kate rajoute aussi des barres obliques devant les « &gt; », aux crochets [ ] et même à certains hyperliens (images). Il y a peut-être des éditeurs de texte plus adaptés ou des réglages à faire.
J’ai rédigé cette dépêche en même temps qu’un article sur LibreOffice 26.2 pour mon site. Si l’article n’est pas vraiment dupliqué, il n’est pas étonnant d’y trouver des morceaux ici. Que tout cela ne nous empêche d’adresser tous nos remerciements à celles et ceux qui font de LibreOffice une suite bureautique si agréable à utiliser et si performante.
Post-scriptum : si vous voulez savoir modifier les couleurs de l’interface comme sur les captures d’écran, ça peut s’envisager, demandez gentiment, avec un peu de chance.
The Document Foundation ou TDF est la fondation de droit allemand qui pilote le projet LibreOffice. Il y a deux formats OOXML différents et donc deux formats XLSX différents, la version 2007 et la version actuelle depuis 2010. S’il vous est vraiment nécessaire d’enregistrer au format XLSX, il faut utiliser la version de 2010. Notes de version.

Last week was the main feature pull of Rust programming language updates for the Linux 7.0 kernel merge window.

We haven't heard much about eCryptfs in recent years for that stackable in-tree Linux file-system providing per-directory encryption support. The FSCRYPT framework has shown its strong capabilities in recent years with various file-systems, Canonical hasn't been pursuing its user home directory encryption like it did years ago for the Ubuntu desktop, and full disk encryption is the most secure approach for ensuring data security on your system.

The world isn’t short on keyboard-based Linux launchers. Albert, Ulauncher, rofi and GNOME Do (if you’re old enough to remember that one) are among those I’ve written about in the past. Rudra is a new spin on this old staple – albeit without the extensibility dedicated quick launchers provide. What’s different here is that it’s implemented as a GNOME Shell extension, not a standalone app. The developer of Rudra, Nark Agni, describes it as a “lightning-fast, keyboard-centric launcher […] designed for power users”. Though inspired by Mac apps like Alfred and Raycast, it is far less capable than those. To […]

The closed-source chat platform Discord announced on February 9 that it would soon require some users to verify their
ages in order to access some content — although the company quickly added that
the "vast majority" of users would not have to. That reassurance has to
contend with the fact that the UK and other countries are implementing
increasingly strict age requirements for social media. Discord's age
verification would be done with an AI age-judging

Magazine that Fedora is now available in Syria once again:
Last week, the Fedora Infrastructure Team lifted
the IP range block on IP addresses in Syria. This action restores
download access to Fedora Linux deliverables, such as ISOs. It also
restores access from Syria to Fedora Linux RPM repositories, the
Fedora Account System, and Fedora build systems. Users can now access
the various applications and services that make up the Fedora
Project. This change follows a recent update to the Fedora Export
Control Policy. Today, anyone connecting to the public Internet from
Syria should once again be able to access Fedora.
[...] Opening the firewall to Syria took seconds. However, months of
conversations and hidden work occurred behind the scenes to make this
happen.

progress report. We've made incredible progress upstreaming patches over the past 12 months. Our patch set has shrunk from 1232 patches with 6.13.8, to 858 as of 6.18.8. Our total delta in terms of lines of code has also shrunk, from 95,000 lines to 83,000 lines for the same kernel versions. Hmm, a 15% reduction in lines of code for a 30% reduction in patches seems a bit wrong… Not all patches are created equal. Some of the upstreamed patches have been small fixes, others have been thousands of lines. All of them, however, pale in comparison to the GPU driver. The GPU driver is 21,000 lines by itself, discounting the downstream Rust abstractions we are still carrying. It is almost double the size of the DCP driver and thrice the size of the ISP/webcam driver, its two closest rivals. And upstreaming work has now begun.

### 1. `EN` [The Pixel 10A and Soundcore Space One are just two of the best deals this week](data/articles/f87956312908c625b29f58ef5ff2a4aa.html)
**Source:** The Verge | **Keyword:** `Tech`
Welcome to the weekend, folks! The Reviews and Guides team here at The Verge is gearing up for all things Unpacked, but Samsung isn’t the only one readying new phones. Google just announced the Pixel 10A, which, for you early adopters, is already up for preorder with a $100 gift card. Elsewhere in deal land, you’ll find steep discounts on mopping vacuums, slight discounts on Soundcore’s cheap ANC headphones, and a rare discount on a new PC controller with swiveling sticks.
So, let’s get to it, shall we?
We finally have a release date for the Pixel 10A: March 5th. What’s more, if you’re thinking about picking up Google’s latest phone, you can already preorder the base-model configuration at Amazon and Best Buy with 128GB of storage and a $100 gift card for $499. Alternatively, Amazon is offering it with a free pair of the Pixel Buds 2A, a fantastic set of recently released earbuds that typically retail for $130.
Despite being a pretty minimal update, Google’s forthcoming Android handset is a pretty solid deal. It doesn’t adopt a lot of features from the flagship Pixel 10 series; however, last year’s Tensor G4 chip is still speedy enough for most tasks, satellite SOS is handy, and you get slightly faster wired and wireless charging. More importantly, it still comes with seven years of OS and security updates, which, personally, I’d take over Magic Cue, Pixel Screenshots, and other AI-based tools any day of the week.
Read our hands-on impressions.
Google Pixel 10A Where to Buy: $599 $499 at Amazon (free $100 gift card) $629 $499 at Amazon (free Pixel Buds 2A) $599 $499 at Best Buy (free $100 gift card) Twelve. That’s how many AC outlets Anker’s 351 Power Strip — which is now available in black or white from Amazon and Anker for $23.99 ($6 off) — packs into its 9.65-inch, surge-protected build. The beefy power strip also features a 20W USB-C port and two USB-A ports, both of which can deliver up to 15W of juice. Just keep in mind that, like with most power strips and like-minded chargers, you’ll have to split power amongst the USB ports, which are limited to a max output of 15W when charging multiple devices simultaneously.
Anker 351 Power Strip Where to Buy: $29.99 $23.99 at Amazon $29.99 $23.99 at Anker (with code WS7DV2YWISTS) I’m admittedly not a huge fan of fighting games — I have no patience for learning combos, dear readers — but the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot seems like a good compromise if I were forced to choose between a traditional controller and one specifically built for hammering out hadokens. And now, the novel gamepad is on sale at both Amazon and Best Buy for $99.99 ($40 off), its lowest price to date.
Although Turtle Beach’s wireless PC controller offers a slew of welcome components, including drift-free Hall effect joysticks and adjustable trigger stops, its defining feature is a pair of rotating modules that can “pivot” to reveal a customizable controller layout that’s better suited for retro titles and fighting games. You also get programmable back buttons, the ability to save up to five profiles, and a 3.5mm audio jack, not to mention compatibility with mobile devices over Bluetooth and Xbox consoles via a wired connection.
Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot Where to Buy: $139.99 $99.99 at Amazon $139.99 $99.99 at Best Buy If you’re looking for a cheap(ish) set of noise-canceling headphones, Soundcore’s Space One are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and directly from Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) in all four colors for $79.99 ($20 off), matching their second-best price to date.
During Cyber Monday last year, our own John Higgins waxed poetic about the over-ear cans, namely because they deliver impressive sound and comfort for the price. The sound quality and ANC don’t rival the flagships from Sony or Bose, sure, but you can try over 20 different presets or tweak the sound yourself using the eight-band equalizer in Anker’s companion app. They can also last up to 40 hours with ANC enabled, meaning you should be able to fly from New York to Singapore and back again without ever having to charge them.
Soundcore Space One Where to Buy: $99 $79.99 at Amazon $99.99 $79.99 at Soundcore (with code WS7DV2G0S7DJ) $99.99 $79.99 at Walmart More ways to save this weekend
Google’s refreshed Nest Cam Indoor, which launched in October, is already down to a new low of $74.99 ($25 off) at Amazon. The wired camera supports 2K HDR video and offers a taller and wider field of view than prior models, along with a new sensor for full-color low-light video. It also comes in a new berry color, which, for better or worse, seems to be Google’s latest obsession.

The creator economy is evolving fast, and ad revenue alone isn’t cutting it anymore. YouTubers are launching product lines, acquiring startups, and building actual business empires. In fact, MrBeast’s company bought fintech startup Step, and his chocolate business is outearning his media arm. This isn’t just one creator’s strategy. For many, it’s the new playbook.

**Source:** Maddyness | **Keyword:** `Entrepreneuriat`
C’est au lycée que Cédric Le Guern imagine sa première lampe de lecture. « A ce moment-là, je passais mon temps à créer de petits produits, grâce à mon imprimante 3D », raconte l’entrepreneur. Mais ce n’est que quelques années plus tard, alors qu’il est étudiant, qu'il se lance dans l’entrepreneuriat et tente de commercialiser l'une de ses inventions : une petite lampe que l’on peut tenir à une main et qui se positionne en bas d’un livre. « J’ai parlé de mon projet à un ami - Lucas Moysan - qui est devenu mon associé. Ensemble, on a lancé une campagne de financement participatif pour voir s’il y avait un engouement autour de notre lampe », raconte Cédric Le Guern. Et en quelques mois, les deux associés enregistrent près de 4 000 commandes pour un montant de 100 000 euros. « Un record cette année-là sur la plateforme », assure Cédric Le Guern.
2 millions d’euros de chiffre d’affaires en 2025
Très vite, les deux entrepreneurs créent Lizia et industrialisent leur produit pour honorer leurs commandes. En trois ans, ils parviennent à commercialiser 100 000 produits. « La première année, on a réalisé 250 000 euros de chiffre d’affaires », précise l’entrepreneur. Un chiffre multiplié par trois chaque année pour atteindre environ 2 millions d’euros de chiffre d’affaires en 2025.

**Source:** Maddyness | **Keyword:** `Entrepreneuriat`
Faire all-in sur une seule carte peut-il s’avérer fatal ? Au casino, évidemment, mais également en matière d’innovation. A l’heure où tous les regards sont braqués sur l’intelligence artificielle, la France ne cesse d’accélérer dans son domaine, en tout cas en matière de financement, tandis que l’Allemagne opte pour une diffusion plus large de l’innovation dans son tissu industriel. C’est ce qui ressort de l’étude annuelle sur l’évolution des investissements dans la tech des deux côtés du Rhin en 2025 réalisée par le fonds franco-allemand Iris.
De prime abord, les écosystèmes tech français et allemand évoluent dans un contexte relativement similaire, marqué par la raréfaction des tours de table et une montée en puissance inexorable de l’IA. Dans le détail, les investissements dans les startups françaises se sont élevés à 7,2 milliards d’euros (+2 %), malgré un recul du nombre d’opérations (591 tours de table, -24 %). Dans le même temps, ce sont 7,5 milliards d’euros qui ont été investis dans la tech allemande, comme en 2024, avec néanmoins une baisse un peu plus limitée du nombre de tours de table (1 426 opérations, -3 %).
Focus sur l’IA en France, meilleure répartition sectorielle en Allemagne
En revanche, c’est sur la concentration du capital que la différence se fait. En France, les dix plus grosses opérations ont représenté l’an passé 37 % des montants investis, soit 2,6

Une innovation qui a séduit plusieurs investisseurs dès 2023. « Nous avons fait une première levée de fonds d’1,2 millions d’euros pour construire deux lignes de production dans l’ouest de la France et embaucher quatre personnes », souligne l’entrepreneur, qui a réalisé 300 000 euros de chiffre d’affaires en 2025 et vise 1,5 million d'euros pour 2026.

Here are the key components: Core Services Frontend UI: React-based web interface with TypeScript for type safety Backend API: Go-based REST and GraphQL APIs with Bearer token authentication for programmatic access Vector Store: PostgreSQL with pgvector for semantic search and memory storage Task Queue: Async task processing system for reliable operation AI Agent: Multi-agent system with specialized roles for efficient testing Knowledge Graph Graphiti: Knowledge graph API for semantic relationship tracking and contextual understanding Neo4j: Graph database for storing and querying relationships between entities, actions, and outcomes Automatic capturing of agent responses and tool executions for building comprehensive knowledge base Monitoring Stack OpenTelemetry: Unified observability data collection and correlation Grafana: Real-time visualization and alerting dashboards VictoriaMetrics: High-performance time-series metrics storage Jaeger: End-to-end distributed tracing for debugging Loki: Scalable log aggregation and analysis Analytics Platform Langfuse: Advanced LLM observability and performance analytics ClickHouse: Column-oriented analytics data warehouse Redis: High-speed caching and rate limiting MinIO: S3-compatible object storage for artifacts Security Tools Web Scraper: Isolated browser environment for safe web interaction Pentesting Tools: Comprehensive suite of 20+ professional security tools Sandboxed Execution: All operations run in isolated containers Memory Systems Long-term Memory: Persistent storage of knowledge and experiences Working Memory: Active context and goals for current operations Episodic Memory: Historical actions and success patterns Knowledge Base: Structured domain expertise and tool capabilities Context Management: Intelligently manages growing LLM context windows using chain summarization The system uses Docker containers for isolation and easy deployment, with separate networks for core services, monitoring, and analytics to ensure proper security boundaries. Each component is designed to scale horizontally and can be configured for high availability in production environments. Quick Start System Requirements Docker and Docker Compose Minimum 2 vCPU Minimum 4GB RAM 20GB free disk space Internet access for downloading images and updates Using Installer ( ) PentAGI provides an interactive installer with a terminal-based UI for streamlined configuration and deployment. The installer guides you through system checks, LLM provider setup, search engine configuration, and security hardening. Supported Platforms: Linux: amd64 download | arm64 download Windows: amd64 download macOS: amd64 (Intel) download | arm64 (M-series) download Quick Installation (Linux amd64): # Create installation directory
mkdir -p pentagi &amp;&amp; cd pentagi # Download installer
wget -O installer.zip https://pentagi.com/downloads/linux/amd64/installer-latest.zip # Extract
unzip installer.zip # Run interactive installer
./installer Prerequisites &amp; Permissions: The installer requires appropriate privileges to interact with the Docker API for proper operation. By default, it uses the Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) which requires either: Option 1 ( for production): Run the installer as root: sudo ./installer Option 2 (Development environments): Grant your user access to the Docker socket by adding them to the docker group: # Add your user to the docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER # Log out and log back in, or activate the group immediately
newgrp docker # Verify Docker access (should run without sudo)
docker ps Security Note: Adding a user to the docker group grants root-equivalent privileges. Only do this for trusted users in controlled environments. For production deployments, consider using rootless Docker mode or running the installer with sudo. The installer will: System Checks: Verify Docker, network connectivity, and system requirements Environment Setup: Create and configure .env file with optimal defaults Provider Configuration: Set up LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, Ollama, Custom) Search Engines: Configure DuckDuckGo, Google, Tavily, Traversaal, Perplexity, Searxng Security Hardening: Generate secure credentials and configure SSL certificates Deployment: Start PentAGI with docker-compose For Production &amp; Enhanced Security: For production deployments or security-sensitive environments, we strongly recommend using a distributed two-node architecture where worker operations are isolated on a separate server. This prevents untrusted code execution and network access issues on your main system. See detailed guide: Worker Node Setup The two-node setup provides: Isolated Execution: Worker containers run on dedicated hardware Network Isolation: Separate network boundaries for penetration testing Security Boundaries: Docker-in-Docker with TLS authentication OOB Attack Support: Dedicated port ranges for out-of-band techniques Manual Installation Create a working directory or clone the repository: mkdir pentagi &amp;&amp; cd pentagi Copy .env.example to .env or download it: curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxcontrol/pentagi/master/.env.example Touch examples files (example.custom.provider.yml, example.ollama.provider.yml) or download it: curl -o example.custom.provider.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vxcontrol/pentagi/master/examples/configs/custom-openai.provider.yml

docker compose up -d Visit localhost:8443 to access PentAGI Web UI (default is admin@pentagi.com / admin) [!NOTE] If you caught an error about pentagi-network or observability-network or langfuse-network you need to run docker-compose.yml firstly to create these networks and after that run docker-compose-langfuse.yml, docker-compose-graphiti.yml, and docker-compose-observability.yml to use Langfuse, Graphiti, and Observability services. You have to set at least one Language Model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, AWS Bedrock, or Ollama) to use PentAGI. AWS Bedrock provides enterprise-grade access to multiple foundation models from leading AI companies, while Ollama provides zero-cost local inference if you have sufficient computational resources. Additional API keys for search engines are optional but for better results. LLM_SERVER_* environment variables are experimental feature and will be changed in the future. Right now you can use them to specify custom LLM server URL and one model for all agent types. PROXY_URL is a global proxy URL for all LLM providers and external search systems. You can use it for isolation from external networks. The docker-compose.yml file runs the PentAGI service as root user because it needs access to docker.sock for container management. If you're using TCP/IP network connection to Docker instead of socket file, you can remove root privileges and use the default pentagi user for better security. Assistant Configuration PentAGI allows you to configure default behavior for assistants: Variable Default Description ASSISTANT_USE_AGENTS false Controls the default value for agent usage when creating new assistants The ASSISTANT_USE_AGENTS setting affects the initial state of the "Use Agents" toggle when creating a new assistant in the UI: false (default): New assistants are created with agent delegation disabled by default true: New assistants are created with agent delegation enabled by default Note that users can always override this setting by toggling the "Use Agents" button in the UI when creating or editing an assistant. This environment variable only controls the initial default state. API Access PentAGI provides comprehensive programmatic access through both REST and GraphQL APIs, allowing you to integrate penetration testing workflows into your automation pipelines, CI/CD processes, and custom applications. Generating API Tokens API tokens are managed through the PentAGI web interface: Navigate to Settings → API Tokens in the web UI Click Create Token to generate a new API token Configure token properties: Name (optional): A descriptive name for the token Expiration Date: When the token will expire (minimum 1 minute, maximum 3 years) Click Create and copy the token immediately - it will only be shown once for security reasons Use the token as a Bearer token in your API requests Each token is associated with your user account and inherits your role's permissions. Using API Tokens Include the API token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests: # GraphQL API example
curl -X POST https://your-pentagi-instance:8443/api/v1/graphql \ -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{"query": "{ flows { id title status } }"}' # REST API example

);
console.log('Created flow:', flow); // List all flows
const flows = await client.getFlows();
console.log(`Total flows: ${flows.length}`); Security Best Practices When working with API tokens: Never commit tokens to version control - use environment variables or secrets management Rotate tokens regularly - set appropriate expiration dates and create new tokens periodically Use separate tokens for different applications - makes it easier to revoke access if needed Monitor token usage - review API token activity in the Settings page Revoke unused tokens - disable or delete tokens that are no longer needed Use HTTPS only - never send API tokens over unencrypted connections Token Management View tokens: See all your active tokens in Settings → API Tokens Edit tokens: Update token names or revoke tokens Delete tokens: Permanently remove tokens (this action cannot be undone) Token ID: Each token has a unique ID that can be copied for reference The token list shows: Token name (if provided) Token ID (unique identifier) Status (active/revoked/expired) Creation date Expiration date Custom LLM Provider Configuration When using custom LLM providers with the LLM_SERVER_* variables, you can fine-tune the reasoning format used in requests: Variable Default Description LLM_SERVER_URL Base URL for the custom LLM API endpoint LLM_SERVER_KEY API key for the custom LLM provider LLM_SERVER_MODEL Default model to use (can be overridden in provider config) LLM_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH Path to the YAML configuration file for agent-specific models LLM_SERVER_PROVIDER Provider name prefix for model names (e.g., openrouter, deepseek for LiteLLM proxy) LLM_SERVER_LEGACY_REASONING false Controls reasoning format in API requests LLM_SERVER_PRESERVE_REASONING false Preserve reasoning content in multi-turn conversations (required by some providers) The LLM_SERVER_PROVIDER setting is particularly useful when using LiteLLM proxy, which adds a provider prefix to model names. For example, when connecting to Moonshot API through LiteLLM, models like kimi-2.5 become moonshot/kimi-2.5. By setting LLM_SERVER_PROVIDER=moonshot, you can use the same provider configuration file for both direct API access and LiteLLM proxy access without modifications. The LLM_SERVER_LEGACY_REASONING setting affects how reasoning parameters are sent to the LLM: false (default): Uses modern format where reasoning is sent as a structured object with max_tokens parameter true: Uses legacy format with string-based reasoning_effort parameter This setting is important when working with different LLM providers as they may expect different reasoning formats in their API requests. If you encounter reasoning-related errors with custom providers, try changing this setting. The LLM_SERVER_PRESERVE_REASONING setting controls whether reasoning content is preserved in multi-turn conversations: false (default): Reasoning content is not preserved in conversation history true: Reasoning content is preserved and sent in subsequent API calls This setting is required by some LLM providers (e.g., Moonshot) that return errors like "thinking is enabled but reasoning_content is missing in assistant tool call message" when reasoning content is not included in multi-turn conversations. Enable this setting if your provider requires reasoning content to be preserved. Local LLM Provider Configuration PentAGI supports Ollama for local LLM inference, providing zero-cost operation and enhanced privacy: Variable Default Description OLLAMA_SERVER_URL URL of your Ollama server OLLAMA_SERVER_MODEL llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0 Default model for inference OLLAMA_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH Path to custom agent configuration file OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_TIMEOUT 600 Timeout for model downloads (seconds) OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_ENABLED false Auto-download models on startup OLLAMA_SERVER_LOAD_MODELS_ENABLED false Query server for available models Configuration examples: # Basic Ollama setup with default model
OLLAMA_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_SERVER_MODEL=llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0 # Production setup with auto-pull and model discovery
OLLAMA_SERVER_URL=http://ollama-server:11434
OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_ENABLED=true
OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_TIMEOUT=900
OLLAMA_SERVER_LOAD_MODELS_ENABLED=true # Custom configuration with agent-specific models
OLLAMA_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/ollama-config.yml # Default configuration file inside docker container
OLLAMA_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/pentagi/conf/ollama-llama318b.provider.yml Performance Considerations: Model Discovery (OLLAMA_SERVER_LOAD_MODELS_ENABLED=true): Adds 1-2s startup latency querying Ollama API Auto-pull (OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_ENABLED=true): First startup may take several minutes downloading models Pull timeout (OLLAMA_SERVER_PULL_MODELS_TIMEOUT=900): 15 minutes in seconds Static Config: Disable both flags and specify models in config file for fastest startup Creating Custom Ollama Models with Extended Context PentAGI requires models with larger context windows than the default Ollama configurations. You need to create custom models with increased num_ctx parameter through Modelfiles. While typical agent workflows consume around 64K tokens, PentAGI uses 110K context size for safety margin and handling complex penetration testing scenarios. Important: The num_ctx parameter can only be set during model creation via Modelfile - it cannot be changed after model creation or overridden at runtime. Example: Qwen3 32B FP16 with Extended Context Create a Modelfile named Modelfile_qwen3_32b_fp16_tc: FROM qwen3:32b-fp16
PARAMETER num_ctx 110000
PARAMETER temperature 0.3
PARAMETER top_p 0.8
PARAMETER min_p 0.0
PARAMETER top_k 20
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1 Build the custom model: ollama create qwen3:32b-fp16-tc -f Modelfile_qwen3_32b_fp16_tc Example: QwQ 32B FP16 with Extended Context Create a Modelfile named Modelfile_qwq_32b_fp16_tc: FROM qwq:32b-fp16
PARAMETER num_ctx 110000
PARAMETER temperature 0.2
PARAMETER top_p 0.7
PARAMETER min_p 0.0
PARAMETER top_k 40
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.2 Build the custom model: ollama create qwq:32b-fp16-tc -f Modelfile_qwq_32b_fp16_tc Note: The QwQ 32B FP16 model requires approximately 71.3 GB VRAM for inference. Ensure your system has sufficient GPU memory before attempting to use this model. These custom models are referenced in the pre-built provider configuration files (ollama-qwen332b-fp16-tc.provider.yml and ollama-qwq32b-fp16-tc.provider.yml) that are included in the Docker image at /opt/pentagi/conf/.

Start Docker Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system. You can start Docker using the following commands: On Linux/macOS: Open a terminal and run: sudo systemctl start docker Or launch Docker Desktop from your applications menu if installed. On Windows: Start Docker Desktop from the Start menu. You can verify Docker is running by executing: docker info If you see information about your Docker installation, it is running correctly. See the table of Local Providers below for a summary. Next step: Run AgenticSeek locally See the Troubleshooting section if you are having issues. If your hardware can't run LLMs locally, see Setup to run with an API. For detailed config.ini explanations, see Config Section. Setup for running LLM locally on your machine Hardware Requirements: To run LLMs locally, you'll need sufficient hardware. At a minimum, a GPU capable of running Magistral, Qwen or Deepseek 14B is required. See the FAQ for detailed model/performance recommendations. Setup your local provider Start your local provider (for example with ollama): Unless you wish to to run AgenticSeek on host (CLI mode), export or set the provider listen address: export OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 Then, start you provider: ollama serve See below for a list of local supported provider. Update the config.ini Change the config.ini file to set the provider_name to a supported provider and provider_model to a LLM supported by your provider. We recommend reasoning model such as Magistral or Deepseek. See the FAQ at the end of the README for required hardware. [MAIN]

Do NOT set provider_name to openai if using LM-studio for running LLMs. Set it to lm-studio. Some provider (eg: lm-studio) require you to have http:// in front of the IP. For example http://127.0.0.1:1234 List of local providers Provider Local? Description ollama Yes Run LLMs locally with ease using ollama as a LLM provider lm-studio Yes Run LLM locally with LM studio (set provider_name to lm-studio) openai Yes Use openai compatible API (eg: llama.cpp server) Next step: Start services and run AgenticSeek See the Troubleshooting section if you are having issues. If your hardware can't run LLMs locally, see Setup to run with an API. For detailed config.ini explanations, see Config Section. Setup to run with an API This setup uses external, cloud-based LLM providers. You'll need an API key from your chosen service. 1. Choose an API Provider and Get an API Key: Refer to the List of API Providers below. Visit their websites to sign up and obtain an API key. 2. Set Your API Key as an Environment Variable: Linux/macOS: Open your terminal and use the export command. It's best to add this to your shell's profile file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc) for persistence. export PROVIDER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here" # Replace PROVIDER_API_KEY with the specific variable name, e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY Example for TogetherAI: export TOGETHER_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" Windows: Command Prompt (Temporary for current session): set PROVIDER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here PowerShell (Temporary for current session): $env:PROVIDER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here" Permanently: Search for "environment variables" in the Windows search bar, click "Edit the system environment variables," then click the "Environment Variables..." button. Add a new User variable with the appropriate name (e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY) and your key as the value. (See FAQ: How do I set API keys? for more details). 3. Update config.ini: [MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = openai # Or google, deepseek, togetherAI, huggingface
provider_model = gpt-3.5-turbo # Or gemini-1.5-flash, deepseek-chat, mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 etc.
provider_server_address = # Typically ignored or can be left blank when is_local = False for most APIs
# ... other settings ... Warning: Make sure there are no trailing spaces in the config.ini values. List of API Providers Provider provider_name Local? Description API Key Link (Examples) OpenAI openai No Use ChatGPT models via OpenAI's API. platform.openai.com/signup Google Gemini google No Use Google Gemini models via Google AI Studio. aistudio.google.com/keys Deepseek deepseek No Use Deepseek models via their API. platform.deepseek.com Hugging Face huggingface No Use models from Hugging Face Inference API. huggingface.co/settings/tokens TogetherAI togetherAI No Use various open-source models via TogetherAI API. api.together.ai/settings/api-keys OpenRouter openrouter No Use OpenRouter Models https://openrouter.ai/ Note: We advise against using gpt-4o or other OpenAI models for complex web browsing and task planning as current prompt optimizations are geared towards models like Deepseek. Coding/bash tasks might encounter issues with Gemini, as it may not strictly follow formatting prompts optimized for Deepseek. The provider_server_address in config.ini is generally not used when is_local = False as the API endpoint is usually hardcoded in the respective provider's library. Next step: Start services and run AgenticSeek See the Known issues section if you are having issues See the Config section for detailed config file explanation. Start services and Run By default AgenticSeek is run fully in docker. Option 1: Run in Docker, use web interface: Start required services. This will start all services from the docker-compose.yml, including: - searxng - redis (required by searxng) - frontend - backend (if using full when using the web interface) ./start_services.sh full # MacOS
start start_services.cmd full # Window Warning: This step will download and load all Docker images, which may take up to 30 minutes. After starting the services, please wait until the backend service is fully running (you should see backend: "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 OK in the log) before sending any messages. The backend services might take 5 minute to start on first run. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and you should see the web interface. Troubleshooting service start: If these scripts fail, ensure Docker Engine is running and Docker Compose (V2, docker compose) is correctly installed. Check the output in the terminal for error messages. See FAQ: Help! I get an error when running AgenticSeek or its scripts. Option 2: CLI mode: To run with CLI interface you would have to install package on host: ./install.sh
./install.bat # windows Then you must change the SEARXNG_BASE_URL in config.ini to: SEARXNG_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080" Start required services. This will start some services from the docker-compose.yml, including: - searxng - redis (required by searxng) - frontend ./start_services.sh # MacOS
start start_services.cmd # Window Run: uv run: uv run python -m ensurepip to ensure uv has pip enabled. Use the CLI: uv run cli.py Usage Make sure the services are up and running with ./start_services.sh full and go to localhost:3000 for web interface. You can also use speech to text by setting listen = True in the config. Only for CLI mode. To exit, simply say/type goodbye. Here are some example usage: Make a snake game in python! Search the web for top cafes in Rennes, France, and save a list of three with their addresses in rennes_cafes.txt. Write a Go program to calculate the factorial of a number, save it as factorial.go in your workspace Search my summer_pictures folder for all JPG files, rename them with today’s date, and save a list of renamed files in photos_list.txt Search online for popular sci-fi movies from 2024 and pick three to watch tonight. Save the list in movie_night.txt. Search the web for the latest AI news articles from 2025, select three, and write a Python script to scrape their titles and summaries. Save the script as news_scraper.py and the summaries in ai_news.txt in /home/projects Friday, search the web for a free stock price API, register with supersuper7434567@gmail.com then write a Python script to fetch using the API daily prices for Tesla, and save the results in stock_prices.csv Note that form filling capabilities are still experimental and might fail. After you type your query, AgenticSeek will allocate the best agent for the task. Because this is an early prototype, the agent routing system might not always allocate the right agent based on your query. Therefore, you should be very explicit in what you want and how the AI might proceed for example if you want it to conduct a web search, do not say: Do you know some good countries for solo-travel? Instead, ask: Do a web search and find out which are the best country for solo-travel Setup to run the LLM on your own server If you have a powerful computer or a server that you can use, but you want to use it from your laptop you have the options to run the LLM on a remote server using our custom llm server. On your "server" that will run the AI model, get the ip address ip a | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1 # local ip
curl https://ipinfo.io/ip # public ip Note: For Windows or macOS, use ipconfig or ifconfig respectively to find the IP address. Clone the repository and enter the server/folder. git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek.git
cd agenticSeek/llm_server/ Install server specific requirements: pip3 install -r requirements.txt Run the server script. python3 app.py --provider ollama --port 3333 You have the choice between using ollama and llamacpp as a LLM service. Now on your personal computer: Change the config.ini file to set the provider_name to server and provider_model to deepseek-r1:xxb. Set the provider_server_address to the ip address of the machine that will run the model. [MAIN]
is_local = False
provider_name = server
provider_model = deepseek-r1:70b
provider_server_address = http://x.x.x.x:3333 Next step: Start services and run AgenticSeek Speech to Text Warning: speech to text only work in CLI mode at the moment. Please note that currently speech to text only work in english. The speech-to-text functionality is disabled by default. To enable it, set the listen option to True in the config.ini file: listen = True When enabled, the speech-to-text feature listens for a trigger keyword, which is the agent's name, before it begins processing your input. You can customize the agent's name by updating the agent_name value in the config.ini file: agent_name = Friday For optimal recognition, we recommend using a common English name like "John" or "Emma" as the agent name Once you see the transcript start to appear, say the agent's name aloud to wake it up (e.g., "Friday"). Speak your query clearly. End your request with a confirmation phrase to signal the system to proceed. Examples of confirmation phrases include: "do it", "go ahead", "execute", "run", "start", "thanks", "would ya", "please", "okay?", "proceed", "continue", "go on", "do that", "go it", "do you understand?" Config Example config: [MAIN]
is_local = True

[BROWSER]
headless_browser = False
stealth_mode = False Explanation of config.ini Settings: [MAIN] Section: is_local: True if using a local LLM provider (Ollama, LM-Studio, local OpenAI-compatible server) or the self-hosted server option. False if using a cloud-based API (OpenAI, Google, etc.). provider_name: Specifies the LLM provider. Local options: ollama, lm-studio, openai (for local OpenAI-compatible servers), server (for the self-hosted server setup). API options: openai, google, deepseek, huggingface, togetherAI. provider_model: The specific model name or ID for the chosen provider (e.g., deepseekcoder:6.7b for Ollama, gpt-3.5-turbo for OpenAI API, mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 for TogetherAI). provider_server_address: The address of your LLM provider. For local providers: e.g., http://127.0.0.1:11434 for Ollama, http://127.0.0.1:1234 for LM-Studio. For the server provider type: The address of your self-hosted LLM server (e.g., http://your_server_ip:3333). For cloud APIs (is_local = False): This is often ignored or can be left blank, as the API endpoint is usually handled by the client library. agent_name: Name of the AI assistant (e.g., Friday). Used as a trigger word for speech-to-text if enabled. recover_last_session: True to attempt to restore the previous session's state, False to start fresh. save_session: True to save the current session's state for potential recovery, False otherwise. speak: True to enable text-to-speech voice output, False to disable. listen: True to enable speech-to-text voice input (CLI mode only), False to disable. work_dir: Crucial: The directory where AgenticSeek will read/write files. Ensure this path is valid and accessible on your system. jarvis_personality: True to use a more "Jarvis-like" system prompt (experimental), False for the standard prompt. languages: A comma-separated list of languages (e.g., en, zh, fr). Used for TTS voice selection (defaults to the first) and can assist the LLM router. Avoid too many or very similar languages for router efficiency. [BROWSER] Section: headless_browser: True to run the automated browser without a visible window ( for web interface or non-interactive use). False to show the browser window (useful for CLI mode or debugging). stealth_mode: True to enable measures to make browser automation harder to detect. May require manual installation of browser extensions like anticaptcha. This section summarizes the supported LLM provider types. Configure them in config.ini. Local Providers (Run on Your Own Hardware): Provider Name in config.ini is_local Description Setup Section ollama True Use Ollama to serve local LLMs. Setup for running LLM locally lm-studio True Use LM-Studio to serve local LLMs. Setup for running LLM locally openai (for local server) True Connect to a local server that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API (e.g., llama.cpp). Setup for running LLM locally server False Connect to the AgenticSeek self-hosted LLM server running on another machine. Setup to run the LLM on your own server API Providers (Cloud-Based): Provider Name in config.ini is_local Description Setup Section openai False Use OpenAI's official API (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4). Setup to run with an API google False Use Google's Gemini models via API. Setup to run with an API deepseek False Use Deepseek's official API. Setup to run with an API huggingface False Use Hugging Face Inference API. Setup to run with an API togetherAI False Use TogetherAI's API for various open models. Setup to run with an API Troubleshooting If you encounter issues, this section provides guidance. Known Issues ChromeDriver Issues Error Example: SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version XXX Root Cause ChromeDriver version incompatibility occurs when: Your installed ChromeDriver version doesn't match your Chrome browser version In Docker environments, undetected_chromedriver may download its own ChromeDriver version, bypassing the mounted binary Solution Steps 1. Check Your Chrome Version Open Google Chrome → Settings &gt; About Chrome to find your version (e.g., "Version 134.0.6998.88") 2. Download Matching ChromeDriver For Chrome 115 and newer: Use the Chrome for Testing API Visit the Chrome for Testing availability dashboard Find your Chrome version or the closest available match Download the ChromeDriver for your OS (Linux64 for Docker environments) For older Chrome versions: Use the legacy ChromeDriver downloads 3. Install ChromeDriver (Choose One Method) Method A: Project Root Directory ( for Docker) # Place the downloaded chromedriver binary in your project root
cp path/to/downloaded/chromedriver ./chromedriver
chmod +x ./chromedriver # Make executable on Linux/macOS Method B: System PATH # Linux/macOS
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver # Windows: Place chromedriver.exe in a folder that's in your PATH 4. Verify Installation # Test the ChromeDriver version
./chromedriver --version
# OR if in PATH:
chromedriver --version Docker-Specific Notes Important for Docker Users: The Docker volume mount approach may not work with stealth mode (undetected_chromedriver) Solution: Place ChromeDriver in the project root directory as ./chromedriver The application will automatically detect and use this binary You should see: "Using ChromeDriver from project root: ./chromedriver" in the logs Troubleshooting Tips Still getting version mismatch? Verify the ChromeDriver is executable: ls -la ./chromedriver Check the ChromeDriver version: ./chromedriver --version Ensure it matches your Chrome browser version Docker container issues? Check backend logs: docker logs backend Look for the message: "Using ChromeDriver from project root" If not found, verify the file exists and is executable Chrome for Testing versions Use the exact version match when possible For version 134.0.6998.88, use ChromeDriver 134.0.6998.165 (closest available) Major version numbers must match (134 = 134) Version Compatibility Matrix Chrome Version ChromeDriver Version Status 134.0.6998.x 134.0.6998.165 Works 133.0.6943.x 133.0.6943.141 Works 132.0.6834.x 132.0.6834.159 Works For the latest compatibility, check the Chrome for Testing dashboard Exception: Failed to initialize browser: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 113 Current browser version is 134.0.6998.89 with binary path This happen if there is a mismatch between your browser and chromedriver version. You need to navigate to download the latest version: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads If you're using Chrome version 115 or newer go to: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/ And download the chromedriver version matching your OS. If this section is incomplete please raise an issue. connection adapters Issues Exception: Provider lm-studio failed: HTTP request failed: No connection adapters were found for '127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions'` (Note: port may vary) Cause: The provider_server_address in config.ini for lm-studio (or other similar local OpenAI-compatible servers) is missing the http:// prefix or is pointing to the wrong port. Solution: Ensure the address includes http://. LM-Studio typically defaults to http://127.0.0.1:1234. Correct config.ini: provider_server_address = http://127.0.0.1:1234 (or your actual LM-Studio server port). SearxNG Base URL Not Provided raise ValueError("SearxNG base URL must be provided either as an argument or via the SEARXNG_BASE_URL environment variable.")
ValueError: SearxNG base URL must be provided either as an argument or via the SEARXNG_BASE_URL environment variable.` This might arise if you are running the CLI mode with the wrong base url for searxng. The SEARXNG_BASE_URL should be depending on whenever you run in docker or on host: Run on host: SEARXNG_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080" Run fully in docker (web interface): SEARXNG_BASE_URL="http://searxng:8080" FAQ Q: What hardware do I need? Model Size GPU 7B 8GB Vram Not . Performance is poor, frequent hallucinations, and planner agents will likely fail. 14B 12 GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 3060) Usable for simple tasks. May struggle with web browsing and planning tasks. 32B 24+ GB VRAM (e.g. RTX 4090) Success with most tasks, might still struggle with task planning 70B+ 48+ GB Vram Excellent. for advanced use cases. Q: I get an error what do I do? Ensure local is running (ollama serve), your config.ini matches your provider, and dependencies are installed. If none work feel free to raise an issue. Q: Can it really run 100% locally? Yes with Ollama, lm-studio or server providers, all speech to text, LLM and text to speech model run locally. Non-local options (OpenAI or others API) are optional. Q: Why should I use AgenticSeek when I have Manus? Unlike Manus, AgenticSeek prioritizes independence from external systems, giving you more control, privacy and avoid api cost. Q: Who is behind the project ? The project was created by me, along with two friends who serve as maintainers and contributors from the open-source community on GitHub. We’re just a group of passionate individuals, not a startup or affiliated with any organization. Any AgenticSeek account on X other than my personal account (https://x.com/Martin993886460) is an impersonation. Contribute We’re looking for developers to improve AgenticSeek! Check out open issues or discussion. Contribution guide : Want to level up AgenticSeek capabilities with features like flight search, trip planning, or snagging the best shopping deals? Consider crafting a custom tool with SerpApi to unlock more Jarvis-like capabilities. With SerpApi, you can turbocharge your agent for specialized tasks while staying in full control.

Toolkit to help you get started with Spec-Driven Development Spec Kit Build high-quality software faster. An open source toolkit that allows you to focus on product scenarios and predictable outcomes instead of vibe coding every piece from scratch. Table of Contents What is Spec-Driven Development? Get Started Video Overview Supported AI Agents Specify CLI Reference Core Philosophy Development Phases Experimental Goals Prerequisites Learn More Detailed Process Troubleshooting Support Acknowledgements License What is Spec-Driven Development? Spec-Driven Development flips the script on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: specifications become executable, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them. Get Started 1. Install Specify CLI Choose your preferred installation method: Option 1: Persistent Installation ( ) Install once and use everywhere: uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git Then use the tool directly: # Create new project
specify init # Or initialize in existing project
specify init . --ai claude
# or
specify init --here --ai claude # Check installed tools
specify check To upgrade Specify, see the Upgrade Guide for detailed instructions. Quick upgrade: uv tool install specify-cli --force --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git Option 2: One-time Usage Run directly without installing: uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init Benefits of persistent installation: Tool stays installed and available in PATH No need to create shell aliases Better tool management with uv tool list, uv tool upgrade, uv tool uninstall Cleaner shell configuration 2. Establish project principles Launch your AI assistant in the project directory. The /speckit.* commands are available in the assistant. Use the /speckit.constitution command to create your project's governing principles and development guidelines that will guide all subsequent development. /speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements 3. Create the spec Use the /speckit.specify command to describe what you want to build. Focus on the what and why, not the tech stack. /speckit.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface. 4. Create a technical implementation plan Use the /speckit.plan command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices. /speckit.plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database. 5. Break down into tasks Use /speckit.tasks to create an actionable task list from your implementation plan. /speckit.tasks 6. Execute implementation Use /speckit.implement to execute all tasks and build your feature according to the plan. /speckit.implement For detailed step-by-step instructions, see our comprehensive guide.

Learn More Complete Spec-Driven Development Methodology - Deep dive into the full process Detailed Walkthrough - Step-by-step implementation guide Detailed Process Click to expand the detailed step-by-step walkthrough You can use the Specify CLI to bootstrap your project, which will bring in the required artifacts in your environment. Run: specify init Or initialize in the current directory: specify init .
# or use the --here flag
specify init --here
# Skip confirmation when the directory already has files
specify init . --force
# or
specify init --here --force You will be prompted to select the AI agent you are using. You can also proactively specify it directly in the terminal: specify init --ai claude
specify init --ai gemini
specify init --ai copilot # Or in current directory:
specify init . --ai claude
specify init . --ai codex # or use --here flag
specify init --here --ai claude
specify init --here --ai codex # Force merge into a non-empty current directory
specify init . --force --ai claude # or
specify init --here --force --ai claude The CLI will check if you have Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor CLI, Qwen CLI, opencode, Codex CLI, Qoder CLI, or Amazon Q Developer CLI installed. If you do not, or you prefer to get the templates without checking for the right tools, use --ignore-agent-tools with your command: specify init --ai claude --ignore-agent-tools STEP 1: Establish project principles Go to the project folder and run your AI agent. In our example, we're using claude. You will know that things are configured correctly if you see the /speckit.constitution, /speckit.specify, /speckit.plan, /speckit.tasks, and /speckit.implement commands available. The first step should be establishing your project's governing principles using the /speckit.constitution command. This helps ensure consistent decision-making throughout all subsequent development phases: /speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements. Include governance for how these principles should guide technical decisions and implementation choices. This step creates or updates the .specify/memory/constitution.md file with your project's foundational guidelines that the AI agent will reference during specification, planning, and implementation phases. STEP 2: Create project specifications With your project principles established, you can now create the functional specifications. Use the /speckit.specify command and then provide the concrete requirements for the project you want to develop. [!IMPORTANT] Be as explicit as possible about what you are trying to build and why. Do not focus on the tech stack at this point. An example prompt: Develop Taskify, a team productivity platform. It should allow users to create projects, add team members,
assign tasks, and move tasks between boards in Kanban style. In this initial phase for this feature,
let's call it "Create Taskify," let's have multiple users but the users will be declared ahead of time, predefined.
I want five users in two different categories, one product manager and four engineers. Let's create three
different sample projects. Let's have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as "To Do,"

### 6. `EN` [Distro Wars 2026: Which Linux Should You Actually Use?](data/articles/b8ac356cc6fbabcedaa7e5b727fdcaa2.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
Everyone has an opinion about Linux distros. Ask on Reddit and you'll get 40 different answers, three flame wars, and someone telling you to use Arch BTW.
This guide isn't that.
This is a practical breakdown — who each distro is actually for, what it's genuinely good at, and which one you should install today based on what you're trying to do. No gatekeeping. No "real Linux users only use X." Just honest picks.
Before picking, understand what actually differs between them — because it's not just the wallpaper.
Package Manager — How you install software. apt (Debian/Ubuntu), dnf (Fedora), pacman (Arch), zypper (openSUSE). This affects what's available and how fresh the software is.
Release Model — Fixed release (Ubuntu, Fedora) ships stable versions on a schedule. Rolling release (Arch, openSUSE Tumbleweed) continuously updates — you always have the latest, but occasionally something breaks.
Desktop Environment — GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE, Cinnamon, etc. Most distros let you choose, but each has a "flagship" DE that's most polished.
Target Audience — Some distros are built for beginners (Ubuntu, Mint), some for developers (Fedora, Arch), some for servers (Debian, RHEL), some for privacy (Tails, Whonix).
Got it? Good. Let's get into the actual contenders.
Best for: Beginners, developers new to Linux, anyone who wants things to just work
Ubuntu is the most documented Linux distro on the planet. Every tutorial, Stack Overflow answer, and blog post that says "on Linux, do this..." means Ubuntu. That's genuinely valuable.
What makes it great:
APT package manager with the largest software repository
Snap packages for easy app installs (controversial but convenient)
LTS releases supported for 5 years — stable, predictable
Best driver support out of the box
Ubuntu Server is the default for cloud VMs (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)
What to watch out for:
Package manager speed: apt install — familiar, reliable, not the fastest
Release: LTS every 2 years (22.04, 24.04...) — predictable and safe
# The command Ubuntu users know by heart
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y Pick Ubuntu if: You're switching from Windows, you need maximum compatibility with tutorials and tools, or you're deploying servers.
Best for: Windows switchers, people who want a familiar desktop, anyone who hated Ubuntu's GNOME
Mint is built on Ubuntu (same packages, same compatibility) but makes very different UI decisions. The Cinnamon desktop feels close to Windows — taskbar at the bottom, Start-menu-style app launcher, system tray. No learning curve for the layout.
It also ships without Snap by default and blocks Canonical from installing it silently. Software installs from traditional APT repos instead.
What makes it great:
Cinnamon desktop is genuinely polished and intuitive
Extremely stable — Mint doesn't rush updates
Update Manager lets you choose how aggressively to update (brilliant for cautious users)
Better multimedia support out of the box (codecs included)
What to watch out for:
conservative — which is a feature for stability but means you might be waiting on newer software versions. Not ideal if you're chasing the latest everything.
Pick Mint if: You're migrating from Windows and want the least adjustment, or you want Ubuntu compatibility without Snap.
Best for: Absolute beginners, Windows migrants who want the smoothest possible transition, non-technical users
If Linux Mint is "familiar," Zorin OS is "identical." It's built specifically to look and feel like Windows — Start menu, taskbar, system tray, right-click behavior — to the point where you can hand it to someone who's never touched Linux and they'll find their way around in minutes.
Zorin is Ubuntu-based, so it inherits full APT compatibility and Ubuntu's enormous software library. But where Mint stays neutral on looks, Zorin actively mimics Windows 11's design language. There's even a "Zorin Appearance" panel where you can switch the desktop layout between Windows-style, macOS-style, or a traditional GNOME-style — without installing anything extra.
What makes it great:
The most Windows-like Linux experience available — bar none
Zorin Appearance panel lets you switch desktop layouts in one click
Ships with a good default app selection — LibreOffice, media players, browser — ready to use
Zorin Connect (like KDE Connect) — sync your phone notifications, files, and clipboard with your PC
Ubuntu base means maximum software compatibility and tutorial coverage
Zorin OS Lite edition runs well on older hardware (4GB RAM, older CPUs)
What to watch out for:
free Core edition and a paid Pro edition (~$47 one-time). The Pro version unlocks extra desktop layouts (macOS-style, touchscreen-optimized), professional app bundles, and priority support. The free version is genuinely complete — you're not missing core features, just cosmetic extras. Some users feel the Pro upsell is prominent for an open-source distro.
# Same Ubuntu/Debian commands — fully familiar
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install Pick Zorin if: You're helping a family member switch from Windows, you want zero learning curve on the desktop, or you need a distro that works well on older hardware with a lightweight edition.
Best for: Developers, people who want cutting-edge without full rolling release chaos
Fedora is Red Hat's "community upstream" — meaning new features land in Fedora first, get stabilized, then go into RHEL (the enterprise version). This makes Fedora consistently 6-12 months ahead of Ubuntu on kernel versions, toolchains, and desktop features.
It ships pure upstream GNOME — no patches, no modifications. If GNOME released it, Fedora has it.
What makes it great:
DNF package manager is fast and excellent
Ships the newest stable kernel — better hardware support for recent machines
Flatpak is the default extra-app format (better than Snap — sandboxed, fast, universal)
Fedora Workstation, Silverblue (immutable), and Server editions each solve different needs
If you learn Linux on Fedora, you understand RHEL/CentOS — hugely valuable professionally
What to watch out for:
will upgrade. Also, some proprietary drivers (Nvidia especially) require a third-party repo (RPM Fusion).
# Fedora's DNF is genuinely great
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install Pick Fedora if: You're a developer who wants modern tools, you care about GNOME being excellent, or you want skills transferable to enterprise Linux.
Best for: Developers who want to understand every layer of their system, power users, people who want the absolute latest software
Arch is a rolling release distro where you build your own system from scratch. No graphical installer. No pre-installed desktop. You choose every component.
This sounds painful. It kind of is the first time. But the result is a system with zero bloat — only exactly what you installed, configured exactly how you want it.
The AUR (Arch User Repository) is the real killer feature — a community-maintained collection of basically every piece of Linux software ever. If it exists, it's probably in the AUR.
What makes it great:
Always the absolute latest software (rolling release)
The Arch Wiki is the best Linux documentation resource on the internet — useful even if you don't use Arch
Pacman is fast and elegant
AUR gives you access to almost any software imaginable
Deep understanding of Linux comes naturally because you built it yourself
What to watch out for:
paru -Syu before a big presentation is not advised). Also: the install process is genuinely manual.
# Arch users install everything themselves
pacman -S # official repos
paru -S # AUR helper for community packages Pick Arch if: You want to learn how Linux actually works, you need bleeding-edge software, or you want maximum customization.
Best for: People who want Arch's power with an actual installer, intermediate users ready to leave Ubuntu
Manjaro is Arch underneath — same AUR access, same rolling release, same pacman — but ships with a polished graphical installer, pre-configured desktop environments (KDE, GNOME, XFCE), and hardware detection that just works out of the box.
The key difference: Manjaro holds packages back from Arch's repos for 2 extra weeks of testing before pushing to users. You're still rolling, still fresh, but with a small safety buffer baked in. For most people stepping up from Ubuntu, this is exactly the right trade-off.
What makes it great:
Full AUR access — same massive software library as Arch
Graphical installer — no manual partitioning commands
Excellent hardware detection, especially Nvidia and WiFi cards
Multiple official desktop flavors — the KDE Plasma edition is particularly polished
Skills transfer directly to Arch if you ever want to go deeper
What to watch out for:
# Same pacman as Arch — your skills transfer perfectly
sudo pacman -Syu # update everything
sudo pacman -S # install from repos
pamac install # Manjaro's friendly package manager CLI Pick Manjaro if: You want AUR access and rolling release freshness but aren't ready to install an OS manually from scratch. It's the best Arch on-ramp available.
Best for: Servers, stability-critical systems, sysadmins, people who want software that never breaks
Debian is what Ubuntu is built on. It prioritizes stability above everything — packages are tested exhaustively before entering the stable release, which means they can be 1-2 years behind the latest version.
On a server, this is perfect. You don't want your database server running experimental kernel builds.
What makes it great:
Exceptional stability — Debian Stable is battle-tested
Huge package repository
Runs on almost any hardware (x86, ARM, MIPS, RISC-V...)
The standard base for containers and VPS images worldwide
Free of corporate influence — community-driven
What to watch out for:
old by design. Newer hardware sometimes needs backport packages. Not a great desktop experience out of the box — it's a server OS that also runs desktops.
Pick Debian if: You're running servers, you prioritize stability over new features, or you want the most principled free software distro.
Best for: Developers wanting rolling release with safety nets, sysadmins, KDE fans
openSUSE comes in two flavors: Leap (stable, RHEL-based) and Tumbleweed (rolling release). Tumbleweed is what makes it interesting — it's a rolling release but with an automated testing pipeline that means updates are validated before they land on your machine. You get freshness without the breakage risk of raw Arch.
YaST is openSUSE's control center — a graphical tool for configuring nearly everything (network, services, users, firewall, packages) that makes system administration approachable.
# Tumbleweed keeps you rolling safely
sudo zypper refresh &amp;&amp; sudo zypper update # update everything
sudo zypper install # install software
yast2 # launch the graphical control center Pick openSUSE Tumbleweed if: You want rolling release stability, KDE Plasma as a polished desktop, or you're a sysadmin who values good tooling. Distro
Stability
Freshness
Beginner-Friendly
Best Use Ubuntu General, servers, cloud Linux Mint Windows migrants, beginners Zorin OS Windows/Mac look-alikes, family PCs Fedora Developers, workstations Arch Power users, learners Manjaro Arch on-ramp, rolling + friendly Debian Servers, stability openSUSE TW Developers, KDE fans Are you new to Linux?
├── Yes → Coming from Windows? → Zorin OS (closest to Windows)
│ Want familiar but free? → Linux Mint
│ Coming from Mac? → Ubuntu or Fedora
└── No → Keep going Are you setting up a server or VPS?
├── Yes → Ubuntu LTS or Debian
└── No → Keep going Do you want the absolute latest software?
├── Yes → Want full control? → Arch Linux
│ Want a safety net? → Manjaro or openSUSE Tumbleweed
└── No → Keep going Are you a developer who wants modern tools without chaos?
└── Fedora (the sweet spot answer) Pop!_OS — Ubuntu base, but with an excellent GNOME customization and best-in-class Nvidia driver support out of the box. Great for gaming.
Kali Linux — Security and penetration testing tooling pre-installed. Not a daily driver. Use it for its specific purpose.
Tails — Runs entirely in RAM, leaves no trace, routes everything through Tor. For maximum privacy situations.
NixOS — Declarative configuration — your entire OS config lives in one file, reproducible anywhere. Steep learning curve but beloved by the people who get it.
There's no "best" distro. There's only the best distro for your situation right now.
If you're just starting — Zorin OS or Mint. Familiar desktop, no friction, same Ubuntu compatibility underneath.
Fedora. Fresh toolchains, excellent GNOME, professionally relevant.
Ubuntu LTS or Debian. Stable, documented, industry standard.
Manjaro. Arch underneath, sane updates, great hardware support.
understand Linux — Arch. Do it once. Even if you go back to Fedora afterward, you'll understand everything you're running.
The distro matters less than you think once you're past the basics. They're all Linux. The terminal commands are the same. The concepts are the same. Pick one and go deep.
What distro are you running? Drop it in the — and tell us why. This is always the most interesting thread.

**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
All you need to know about OpenClaw --- The Complete Guide to Your Personal AI Agent Everything you need to know about the open-source AI agent that went from zero to 140K GitHub stars in under three months.
Introduction &amp; Context
Architecture &amp; High-Level Design
Getting Started (Step-by-Step Guide)
Practical Applications &amp; Productivity
Optimization, Security &amp; Challenges
Imagine having an assistant that can actually do things — not just answer questions or generate text, but execute tasks, manage your schedule, write code, control your smart home, and respond on your behalf — all running privately on your own hardware, with zero data leaving your machine.
That's OpenClaw. Formerly known as Clawdbot and then Moltbot, it's one of the fastest-growing open-source projects of early 2026.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Here's what makes OpenClaw special in one sentence:
OpenClaw transforms any messaging app into a command center for AI-powered automation, while keeping everything local and under your control.
You send a message to your assistant on WhatsApp: "Summarize my unread emails and schedule a meeting with Sarah for Thursday afternoon."
OpenClaw:
Understands your intent (natural language processing)
Accesses your Gmail (via secure API)
Reads your calendar (checking availability)
Generates a summary (using an LLM)
Creates a calendar event (via Google Calendar API)
Replies back to you on WhatsApp with confirmation
All of this happens on your machine, with your API keys, following your rules.
OpenClaw's timing was perfect — it hit the intersection of a few trends that had been building for years:
1. The Local-First Movement People are waking up to the privacy implications of cloud-only AI. When you use ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, your conversations are processed on someone else's servers. With OpenClaw:
Your data stays YOUR data No vendor lock-in
No training on your private information
No internet required for local operations
2. Open Source = Trust + Innovation OpenClaw is fully open source (MIT License). This means:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ OPEN SOURCE ADVANTAGES │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ │
│ You can audit the code yourself │
│ Security researchers can find and fix bugs │
│ Community contributes features and skills │
│ No hidden tracking or data collection │
│ You can fork and customize for your needs │
│ Transparent development process │
│ │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ 3. The "Chat-First" Interface Revolution We're witnessing the death of traditional app interfaces. Instead of opening 10 different apps: Email client Calendar app Browser Notes app Shopping apps Music apps
You just send a message. One interface to rule them all.
4. The Plugin/Skill Architecture OpenClaw's "Skills" system allows anyone to extend its capabilities:
Want it to control your Philips Hue lights? There's a skill for that.
Want it to query your company's internal database? Build a skill.
Want it to generate images with Stable Diffusion? Install the skill.
This extensibility creates a flywheel effect: more users → more skills → more value → more users.
OpenClaw's evolution tells a fascinating story: Date
Milestone Nov 2025
Peter Steinberger publishes Clawdbot — derived from Clawd (now Molty), named after Anthropic's Claude Jan 27, 2026
Renamed Moltbot after Anthropic trademark complaints; Matt Schlicht launches Moltbook — a social network for AI agents Jan 30, 2026
Renamed OpenClaw — "Moltbot never quite rolled off the tongue"; 140,000 GitHub stars &amp; 20,000 forks by Feb 2 Feb 4, 2026 ClawCon in San Francisco; adopted by Silicon Valley &amp; China companies; DeepSeek integration Feb 14, 2026
Steinberger announces joining OpenAI; project moves to open-source foundation Before jumping into installation, it's worth spending five minutes understanding why OpenClaw works the way it does. This will save you a lot of confusion later.
Concept 1: Autonomous Agents Traditional software is reactive: it waits for user input, processes it, and returns a result.
AI agents are proactive: they can:
Take initiative based on schedules (cron jobs)
Make decisions using reasoning
Execute multi-step plans
Handle errors and retry
Learn from interactions ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ REACTIVE VS AUTONOMOUS SOFTWARE │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ Concept 2: LLM Routing OpenClaw doesn't just use one AI model — it routes tasks to the best model for the job.
Here's the magic: Task Type

Claude Opus 4.6
Best code quality Quick questions
Gemini Flash
Speed &amp; low cost Creative writing
GPT-5.2
Creativity Image analysis
Claude 3.5 Sonnet
Visual strength Local/Sensitive
Local Llama
Privacy Why this matters:
Cost optimization: Don't use expensive models for simple tasks
Quality optimization: Use the best model for each specific task
Latency optimization: Use fast models when speed matters
Privacy optimization: Use local models for sensitive data
Concept 3: The ReAct Pattern OpenClaw uses an industry-standard AI architecture called ReAct (Reasoning + Acting):

Description
Example Short-term
Current conversation context
"What was I asking about again?" Long-term
Curated knowledge (MEMORY.md)
"User prefers dark mode" Session History
Past conversations
"Yesterday we discussed Python" External
Files, databases, APIs
Calendar events, emails, documents Working Memory (current session) → [Summarize &amp; Store] → Daily Notes (auto-captured) → [Review &amp; Distill] → Long-term Memory (MEMORY.md) → [Enrich Context] External Sources (files/APIs/DB) → [Query &amp; Read] → Working Memory Let's compare OpenClaw's approach to cloud-based alternatives: Aspect
Cloud AI Assistants
OpenClaw (Local-First) Privacy
Data on vendor servers
Data stays on your devices Customization
Limited to vendor features
Fully customizable Cost
Subscription fees
Pay only for API usage (optional) Offline Use Requires internet Many features work offline Integrations
Vendor-approved only
Any integration you can code Model Choice
Vendor's choice
Any model (local or API) Speed
Network latency
Local = instant Control

**Source:** GitHub Trending | **Keyword:** `GitHub`
Hugging Face Skills Hugging Face Skills are definitions for AI/ML tasks like dataset creation, model training, and evaluation. They are interoperable with all major coding agent tools like OpenAI Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, Google DeepMind's Gemini CLI, and Cursor. The Skills in this repository follow the standardized format Agent Skill format. How do Skills work? In practice, skills are self-contained folders that package instructions, scripts, and resources together for an AI agent to use on a specific use case. Each folder includes a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) followed by the guidance your coding agent follows while the skill is active. [!NOTE] 'Skills' is actually an Anthropic term used within Claude AI and Claude Code and not adopted by other agent tools, but we love it! OpenAI Codex uses an AGENTS.md file to define the instructions for your coding agent. Google Gemini uses 'extensions' to define the instructions for your coding agent in a gemini-extension.json file. This repo is compatible with all of them, and more! [!TIP] If your agent doesn't support skills, you can use agents/AGENTS.md directly as a fallback. Installation Hugging Face skills are compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Cursor. Claude Code Register the repository as a plugin marketplace: /plugin marketplace add huggingface/skills To install a skill, run: /plugin install @huggingface/skills For example: /plugin install hugging-face-cli@huggingface/skills Codex Codex will identify the skills via the AGENTS.md file. You can verify the instructions are loaded with: codex --ask-for-approval never "Summarize the current instructions." For more details, see the Codex AGENTS guide. Gemini CLI This repo includes gemini-extension.json to integrate with the Gemini CLI. Install locally: gemini extensions install . --consent or use the GitHub URL: gemini extensions install https://github.com/huggingface/skills.git --consent See Gemini CLI extensions docs for more help. Cursor This repository includes Cursor plugin manifests: .cursor-plugin/plugin.json .mcp.json (configured with the Hugging Face MCP server URL) Install from repository URL (or local checkout) via the Cursor plugin flow. For contributors, regenerate manifests with: ./scripts/publish.sh Skills This repository contains a few skills to get you started. You can also contribute your own skills to the repository. Available skills Name Description Documentation hugging-face-cli Execute Hugging Face Hub operations using the hf CLI. Download models/datasets, upload files, manage repos, and run cloud compute jobs. SKILL.md hugging-face-datasets Create and manage datasets on Hugging Face Hub. Supports initializing repos, defining configs/system prompts, streaming row updates, and SQL-based dataset querying/transformation. SKILL.md hugging-face-evaluation Add and manage evaluation results in Hugging Face model cards. Supports extracting eval tables from README content, importing scores from Artificial Analysis API, and running custom evaluations with vLLM/lighteval. SKILL.md hugging-face-jobs Run compute jobs on Hugging Face infrastructure. Execute Python scripts, manage scheduled jobs, and monitor job status. SKILL.md hugging-face-model-trainer Train or fine-tune language models using TRL on Hugging Face Jobs infrastructure. Covers SFT, DPO, GRPO and reward modeling training methods, plus GGUF conversion for local deployment. Includes hardware selection, cost estimation, Trackio monitoring, and Hub persistence. SKILL.md hugging-face-paper-publisher Publish and manage research papers on Hugging Face Hub. Supports creating paper pages, linking papers to models/datasets, claiming authorship, and generating professional markdown-based research articles. SKILL.md hugging-face-tool-builder Build reusable scripts for Hugging Face API operations. Useful for chaining API calls or automating repeated tasks. SKILL.md hugging-face-trackio Track and visualize ML training experiments with Trackio. Log metrics via Python API and retrieve them via CLI. Supports real-time dashboards synced to HF Spaces. SKILL.md Using skills in your coding agent Once a skill is installed, mention it directly while giving your coding agent instructions: "Use the HF LLM trainer skill to estimate the GPU memory needed for a 70B model run." "Use the HF model evaluation skill to launch run_eval_job.py on the latest checkpoint." "Use the HF dataset creator skill to draft new few-shot classification templates." "Use the HF paper publisher skill to index my arXiv paper and link it to my model." Your coding agent automatically loads the corresponding SKILL.md instructions and helper scripts while it completes the task. Contribute or customize a skill Copy one of the existing skill folders (for example, hf-datasets/) and rename it. Update the new folder's SKILL.md frontmatter: ---
name: my-skill-name
description: Describe what the skill does and when to use it
--- # Skill Title

Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more pandas: A Powerful Python Data Analysis Toolkit Testing Package Meta What is it? pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open-source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way towards this goal. Table of Contents Main Features Where to get it Dependencies Installation from sources License Documentation Background Getting Help Discussion and Development Contributing to pandas Main Features Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well: Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN, NA, or NaT) in floating point as well as non-floating point data Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets Intuitive merging and joining data sets Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick) Robust I/O tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging Where to get it The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the Python Package Index (PyPI) and on Conda. # conda

GitNexus: The Zero-Server Code Intelligence Engine - GitNexus is a client-side knowledge graph creator that runs entirely in your browser. Drop in a GitHub repo or ZIP file, and get an interactive knowledge graph wit a built in Graph RAG Agent. Perfect for code exploration GitNexus Building git for agent context. Indexes any codebase into a knowledge graph — every dependency, call chain, cluster, and execution flow — then exposes it through smart tools so AI agents never miss code. https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/172685ba-8e54-4ea7-9ad1-e31a3398da72 Like DeepWiki, but deeper. DeepWiki helps you understand code. GitNexus lets you analyze it — because a knowledge graph tracks every relationship, not just descriptions. TL;DR: The Web UI is a quick way to chat with any repo. The CLI + MCP is how you make your AI agent actually reliable — it gives Cursor, Claude Code, and friends a deep architectural view of your codebase so they stop missing dependencies, breaking call chains, and shipping blind edits. Even smaller models get full architectural clarity, making it compete with goliath models. Two Ways to Use GitNexus CLI + MCP Web UI What Index repos locally, connect AI agents via MCP Visual graph explorer + AI chat in browser For Daily development with Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, OpenCode Quick exploration, demos, one-off analysis Scale Full repos, any size Limited by browser memory (~5k files) Install npm install -g gitnexus No install —gitnexus.vercel.app Storage KuzuDB native (fast, persistent) KuzuDB WASM (in-memory, per session) Parsing Tree-sitter native bindings Tree-sitter WASM Privacy Everything local, no network Everything in-browser, no server CLI + MCP ( ) The CLI indexes your repository and runs an MCP server that gives AI agents deep codebase awareness. Quick Start # Index your repo (run from repo root)
npx gitnexus analyze That's it. This indexes the codebase, installs agent skills, registers Claude Code hooks, and creates AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md context files — all in one command. To configure MCP for your editor, run npx gitnexus setup once — or set it up manually below. MCP Setup gitnexus setup auto-detects your editors and writes the correct global MCP config. You only need to run it once. Editor Support Editor MCP Skills Hooks (auto-augment) Support Claude Code Yes Yes Yes (PreToolUse) Full Cursor Yes Yes — MCP + Skills Windsurf Yes — — MCP OpenCode Yes Yes — MCP + Skills Claude Code gets the deepest integration: MCP tools + agent skills + PreToolUse hooks that automatically enrich grep/glob/bash calls with knowledge graph context. If you prefer manual configuration: Claude Code (full support — MCP + skills + hooks): claude mcp add gitnexus -- npx -y gitnexus@latest mcp Cursor (~/.cursor/mcp.json — global, works for all projects): { "mcpServers": { "gitnexus": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "gitnexus@latest", "mcp"] } }
} OpenCode (~/.config/opencode/config.json): { "mcp": { "gitnexus": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "gitnexus@latest", "mcp"] } }
} CLI Commands gitnexus setup # Configure MCP for your editors (one-time)
gitnexus analyze [path] # Index a repository (or update stale index)
gitnexus analyze --force # Force full re-index
gitnexus analyze --skip-embeddings # Skip embedding generation (faster)

gitnexus wiki --base-url # Wiki with custom LLM API base URL What Your AI Agent Gets 7 tools exposed via MCP: Tool What It Does repo Param list_repos Discover all indexed repositories — query Process-grouped hybrid search (BM25 + semantic + RRF) Optional context 360-degree symbol view — categorized refs, process participation Optional impact Blast radius analysis with depth grouping and confidence Optional detect_changes Git-diff impact — maps changed lines to affected processes Optional rename Multi-file coordinated rename with graph + text search Optional cypher Raw Cypher graph queries Optional When only one repo is indexed, the repo parameter is optional. With multiple repos, specify which one: query({query: "auth", repo: "my-app"}). Resources for instant context: Resource Purpose gitnexus://repos List all indexed repositories (read this first) gitnexus://repo/{name}/context Codebase stats, staleness check, and available tools gitnexus://repo/{name}/clusters All functional clusters with cohesion scores gitnexus://repo/{name}/cluster/{name} Cluster members and details gitnexus://repo/{name}/processes All execution flows gitnexus://repo/{name}/process/{name} Full process trace with steps gitnexus://repo/{name}/schema Graph schema for Cypher queries 2 MCP prompts for guided workflows: Prompt What It Does detect_impact Pre-commit change analysis — scope, affected processes, risk level generate_map Architecture documentation from the knowledge graph with mermaid diagrams 4 agent skills installed to .claude/skills/ automatically: Exploring — Navigate unfamiliar code using the knowledge graph Debugging — Trace bugs through call chains Impact Analysis — Analyze blast radius before changes Refactoring — Plan safe refactors using dependency mapping Multi-Repo MCP Architecture GitNexus uses a global registry so one MCP server can serve multiple indexed repos. No per-project MCP config needed — set it up once and it works everywhere. flowchart TD subgraph CLI [CLI Commands] Setup["gitnexus setup"] Analyze["gitnexus analyze"] Clean["gitnexus clean"] List["gitnexus list"] end subgraph Registry ["~/.gitnexus/"] RegFile["registry.json"] end subgraph Repos [Project Repos] RepoA[".gitnexus/ in repo A"] RepoB[".gitnexus/ in repo B"] end subgraph MCP [MCP Server] Server["server.ts"] Backend["LocalBackend"] Pool["Connection Pool"] ConnA["KuzuDB conn A"] ConnB["KuzuDB conn B"] end Setup --&gt;|"writes global MCP config"| CursorConfig["~/.cursor/mcp.json"] Analyze --&gt;|"registers repo"| RegFile Analyze --&gt;|"stores index"| RepoA Clean --&gt;|"unregisters repo"| RegFile List --&gt;|"reads"| RegFile Server --&gt;|"reads registry"| RegFile Server --&gt; Backend Backend --&gt; Pool Pool --&gt;|"lazy open"| ConnA Pool --&gt;|"lazy open"| ConnB ConnA --&gt;|"queries"| RepoA ConnB --&gt;|"queries"| RepoB How it works: Each gitnexus analyze stores the index in .gitnexus/ inside the repo (portable, gitignored) and registers a pointer in ~/.gitnexus/registry.json. When an AI agent starts, the MCP server reads the registry and can serve any indexed repo. KuzuDB connections are opened lazily on first query and evicted after 5 minutes of inactivity (max 5 concurrent). If only one repo is indexed, the repo parameter is optional on all tools — agents don't need to change anything. Web UI (browser-based) A fully client-side graph explorer and AI chat. No server, no install — your code never leaves the browser. Try it now: gitnexus.vercel.app — drag &amp; drop a ZIP and start exploring. Or run locally: git clone https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/gitnexus.git
cd gitnexus/gitnexus-web
npm install
npm run dev The web UI uses the same indexing pipeline as the CLI but runs entirely in WebAssembly (Tree-sitter WASM, KuzuDB WASM, in-browser embeddings). It's great for quick exploration but limited by browser memory for larger repos. The Problem GitNexus Solves Tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Cline, Roo Code, and Windsurf are powerful — but they don't truly know your codebase structure. What happens: AI edits UserService.validate() Doesn't know 47 functions depend on its return type Breaking changes ship Traditional Graph RAG vs GitNexus Traditional approaches give the LLM raw graph edges and hope it explores enough.

Build and deploy AI Agents on Cloudflare Cloudflare Agents Agents are persistent, stateful execution environments for agentic workloads, powered by Cloudflare Durable Objects. Each agent has its own state, storage, and lifecycle — with built-in support for real-time communication, scheduling, AI model calls, MCP, workflows, and more. Agents hibernate when idle and wake on demand. You can run millions of them — one per user, per session, per game room — each costs nothing when inactive. npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template cloudflare/agents-starter Or add to an existing project: npm install agents Read the docs — getting started, API reference, guides, and more. Quick Example A counter agent with persistent state, callable methods, and real-time sync to a React frontend: // server.ts
import { Agent, routeAgentRequest, callable } from "agents"; export type CounterState = { count: number }; export class CounterAgent extends Agent { initialState = { count: 0 }; @callable() increment() { this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); return this.state.count; } @callable() decrement() { this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 }); return this.state.count; }
} export default { async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) { return ( (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ?? new Response("Not found", { status: 404 }) ); }
}; // client.tsx
import { useAgent } from "agents/react";
import { useState } from "react";
import type { CounterAgent, CounterState } from "./server"; function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0); const agent = useAgent({ agent: "CounterAgent", onStateUpdate: (state) =&gt; setCount(state.count) }); return ( {count} agent.stub.increment()}&gt;+ agent.stub.decrement()}&gt;- );
} State changes sync to all connected clients automatically. Call methods like they're local functions. Features Feature Description Persistent State Syncs to all connected clients, survives restarts Callable Methods Type-safe RPC via the @callable() decorator Scheduling One-time, recurring, and cron-based tasks WebSockets Real-time bidirectional communication with lifecycle hooks AI Chat Message persistence, resumable streaming, server/client tool execution MCP Act as MCP servers or connect as MCP clients Workflows Durable multi-step tasks with human-in-the-loop approval Email Receive and respond via Cloudflare Email Routing Code Mode LLMs generate executable TypeScript instead of individual tool calls SQL Direct SQLite queries via Durable Objects React Hooks useAgent and useAgentChat for frontend integration Vanilla JS Client AgentClient for non-React environments Coming soon: Realtime voice agents, web browsing (headless browser), sandboxed code execution, and multi-channel communication (SMS, messengers).

This repository is for active development of the Azure SDK for Python. For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting our public developer docs at https://learn.microsoft.com/python/azure/ or our versioned developer docs at https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-python. Azure SDK for Python This repository is for the active development of the Azure SDK for Python. For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting our public developer docs or our versioned developer docs. Getting started For your convenience, each service has a separate set of libraries that you can choose to use instead of one, large Azure package. To get started with a specific library, see the README.md (or README.rst) file located in the library's project folder. You can find service libraries in the /sdk directory. Prerequisites The client libraries are supported on Python 3.9 or later. For more details, please read our page on Azure SDK for Python version support policy. Packages available Each service might have a number of libraries available from each of the following categories: Client - New Releases Client - Previous Versions Management - New Releases Management - Previous Versions Client: New Releases New wave of packages that we are announcing as GA and several that are currently releasing in preview. These libraries allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. These libraries share several core functionalities such as: retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc. that can be found in the azure-core library. You can learn more about these libraries by reading guidelines that they follow here. You can find the most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries. Client: Previous Versions Last stable versions of packages that have been provided for usage with Azure and are production-ready. These libraries provide you with similar functionalities to the Preview ones as they allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. They might not implement the guidelines or have the same feature set as the November releases. They do however offer wider coverage of services. Management: New Releases A new set of management libraries that follow the Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python are now available. These new libraries provide a number of core capabilities that are shared amongst all Azure SDKs, including the intuitive Azure Identity library, an HTTP Pipeline with custom policies, error-handling, distributed tracing, and much more. Documentation and code samples for these new libraries can be found here. In addition, a migration guide that shows how to transition from older versions of libraries is located here. You can find the most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries. Also, if you are experiencing authentication issues with the management libraries after upgrading certain packages, it's possible that you upgraded to the new versions of SDK without changing the authentication code, please refer to the migration guide mentioned above for proper instructions. Management: Previous Versions For a complete list of management libraries that enable you to provision and manage Azure resources, please check here. They might not have the same feature set as the new releases but they do offer wider coverage of services. Management libraries can be identified by namespaces that start with azure-mgmt-, e.g. azure-mgmt-compute Need help? For detailed documentation visit our Azure SDK for Python documentation File an issue via GitHub Issues Check previous questions or ask new ones on StackOverflow using azure and python tags. Data Collection The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described below. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and Microsoft’s privacy statement. For more information on the data collected by the Azure SDK, please visit the Telemetry Guidelines page. Telemetry Configuration Telemetry collection is on by default. To opt out, you can disable telemetry at client construction. Define a NoUserAgentPolicy class that is a subclass of UserAgentPolicy with an on_request method that does nothing. Then pass instance of this class as kwargs user_agent_policy=NoUserAgentPolicy() during client creation. This will disable telemetry for all methods in the client. Do this for every new client. The example below uses the azure-storage-blob package. In your code, you can replace azure-storage-blob with the package you are using. import os
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from azure.core.pipeline.policies import UserAgentPolicy # Create your credential you want to use
mi_credential = ManagedIdentityCredential() account_url = "https://.blob.core.windows.net" # Set up user-agent override
class NoUserAgentPolicy(UserAgentPolicy): def on_request(self, request): pass # Create the BlobServiceClient object
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=mi_credential, user_agent_policy=NoUserAgentPolicy()) container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container=) # TODO: do something with the container client like download blob to a file Reporting security issues and security bugs Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) secure@microsoft.com. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Haiku est un système d’exploitation pensé pour les ordinateurs de bureau. Il est basé sur BeOS mais propose aujourd’hui une implémentation modernisée, performante, et qui conserve les idées qui rendaient BeOS intéressant: une interface intuitive mais permettant une utilisation avancée, une API unifiée et cohérente, et une priorisation de l’interface graphique par rapport à la ligne de commande pour l’administration du système.
Il ne s’agit pas d’une distribution Linux, mais d’un système complet avec son propre noyau, sa propre pile graphique, etc. L’idée de cette approche est d’avoir une seule équipe travaillant sur toute la pile logicielle, pour éviter les soucis de coordination entre projets indépendant et d’excès de modularité, qui peuvent aboutir à une architecture logicielle inefficace. En revanche, cela demande un gros travail pour une équipe relativement réduite, et le système est donc en développement depuis bientôt un quart de siècle sans avoir encore publié une version majeure complète.
La cinquième version beta a été publiée en 2024. Les développements continuent pour stabiliser, optimiser et peaufiner le système, avec une version beta 6 prévue en début de cette année, qui sera probablement suivie par une beta 7 quelque temps plus tard.
Cette série de dépêches est basée sur les rapports d’activité publiés mensuellement par le projet Haiku. Cette édition couvre les modifications de Haiku numérotées entre hrev59111 et hrev59355 (soit 244 changements individuels), en plus d’activités se déroulant hors du dépôt Git principal.
Entre parenthèses est indiqué le pseudonyme de l’auteur ou autrice principal·e du changement. Des pseudonymes sont utilisés par habitude (venant des canaux IRC et/ou de la culture de la demoscene) et aussi pour préserver l’identité des personnes qui le souhaitent (certains participants utilisent également leur nom légal, d’autres pas). lien nᵒ 1 : Dépêche trimestrielle précédente

Mise à jour de haiku-format
À quand la beta 6?
Mise à jour de Go en version 1.18
Le mois de novembre a vu l’arrivée d’une grosse mise à jour de la chaîne d’outils pour le langage Go en version 1.18. Il s’agit d’une version de 2022, mais c’est un gros progrès puisque la version précédente disponible pour Haiku était la version 1.4 datant de 2014. De plus, cette version 1.18 est disponible dans le dépôt de paquets et peut être installée normalement avec pkgman (au moins pour les architectures x86 et x86_64).
La plus grande partie du travail a été réalisée par Korli, depuis plusieurs années, pour mettre en place l’environnement de compilation nécessaire, et aussi corriger de nombreux problèmes de compatibilité POSIX dans Haiku qui ont été mis en évidence par les tests de Go.
Cela permet par exemple d’utiliser Hugo, le générateur de site statique utilisé pour le site principal de Haiku. Waddlesplash a donc pu rédiger et vérifier le rapport d’activité de novembre en utilisant uniquement Haiku : avec Hugo, WebPositive (le navigateur natif de Haiku, basé sur WebKit), l’éditeur de texte Koder, ainsi que Iceweasel (un portage de Firefox) pour la correction d’orthographe.
Redémarrage automatique de app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique de Haiku. Il s’agit d’un composant critique, pour lequel un crash rend le système à peu près inutilisable. Waddlesplash a corrigé plusieurs problèmes dans le code pour permettre de redémarrer le serveur après un crash, et de le reconnecter avec les applications en cours d’exécution. Ce redémarrage nécessite encore quelques étapes manuelles car les crash démarrent actuellement le debugger automatiquement, mais cela peut être changé par une simple configuration.
Applications
ActivityMonitor
ActivityMonitor affiche sous forme graphique divers paramètres du système: charge CPU, consommation mémoire… Il peut s’exécuter dans une fenêtre ou bien être intégré au bureau sous forme d’un « réplicant ».
Affichage d’un message « pas de capteurs de température » à la place du graphe de température du système si l’information n’est pas disponible (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème de localisation, certains fichiers sources n’étaient pas pris en compte et les chaînes contenues dedans ne pouvaient pas être traduites (humdinger).
Terminal
Le Terminal permet d’exécuter des applications en ligne de commande.
Synchronisation du presse-papier interne du Terminal avec celui du système seulement une fois au démarrage de l’application, et pas lors du changement d’onglet comme cela avait été implémenté au trimestre précédent (OscarL).
Correction d’un problème qui masquait le signal SIGUSR1 pour les shells et autres processus lancés dans le terminal (korli).
Implémentation des séquences d’échappement permettant aux applications CLI de définir des liens hypertextes (en complément des liens qui étaient déjà détectés automatiquement par le terminal en fonction du contenu du texte) (korli).
HaikuDepot
HaikuDepot est l’interface graphique du gestionnaire de paquets. Il utilise un backend en ligne en Java pour stocker et récupérer les captures d’écrans, et notes d’utilisateurs, icônes des paquets, liste de paquets mis en avant, et d’autres informations.
L’application est plus robuste en cas de problème de réseau : gestion des erreurs et affichage de messages clairs pour l’utilisateur. Gestion en particulier des erreurs 503 remontées par l’API web utilisée par HaikuDepot (apl).
Ajout de filtres pour trouver facilement les applications « natives » (n’utilisant pas Qt ou GTK) et d’un filtre « desktop » pour trouver les applications graphiques (et filtrer un très grand nombre de paquets de bibliothèques, applications en ligne de commande…) (apl, avec des améliorations par humdinger pour clarifier la terminologie).
Amélioration de la taille de la fenêtre des conditions d’utilisation sur les écrans haute densité (nipos).
Refonte de la gestion des identifiants de messages internes à l’application HaikuDepot pour en simplifier la maintenance (apl).
Interdiction de la sélection multiple dans la liste des paquets (apl).
WebPositive
WebPositive est le navigateur web fourni avec Haiku. Il est basé sur le moteur WebKit, co-développé avec Apple, Sony, Igalia et d’autres participants.
Modification du message envoyé au Tracker pour ouvrir le dossier contenant un fichier (par exemple un téléchargement), pour utiliser le message officiellement prévu à cet effet plutôt qu’un moyen détourné (humdinger).
Meilleure gestion des noms de fichiers longs dans la fenêtre de téléchargements avec l’ajout d’une barre de défilement horizontal (mull, avec un petit correctif par humdinger pour corriger un décalage d’un pixel du positionnement de la barre de défilement).
Un chantier est en cours pour réintégrer à nouveau le portage de WebKit pour Haiku dans les sources upstream. Cela avait déjà été fait en 2010, mais n’avait pas été maintenu par la suite, ce qui a conduit à retirer ce code. Depuis, Haiku utilise un fork resynchronisé régulièrement, mais cela génère du travail en plus. L’envoi du code est aussi l’occasion de faire relire toutes les modifications par les autres développeurs de WebKit, avec des conseils pour améliorer et simplifier l’architecture.
Expander
Expander est une application permettant de décompresser des archives.
Correction d’un décalage d’un pixel de la barre de défilement (humdinger).
AboutSystem
AboutSystem affiche quelques informations sur le système et surtout la liste des auteurs de Haiku.
Simplification du code pour la mise à jour automatique des couleurs, mise en place de la mise à jour automatique des couleurs pour la liste des crédits (si on passe en mode sombre par exemple) (jscipione).
Ouverture de la fenêtre avec une taille respectant les proportions du nombre d’or, esthétiquement plus plaisant (axeld).
LaunchBox
LaunchBox est un « dock » permettant de stocker des raccourcis vers des applications ou fichiers fréquemment utilisés.
Correction de la couleur du panneau de LaunchBox, et d’autres couleurs dans le sélectionneur de couleurs standard (nephele).
Tracker
Tracker est l’explorateur de fichiers. Le code du Tracker contient également les fenêtres « ouvrir » et « enregistrer sous », mises à disposition des autres applications sous forme de la bibliothèque libtracker.so.
Envoi de la notification d’activation de l’espace de travail à tous les réplicants, afin que ces derniers puissent ajuster leur couleur (par exemple) en fonction de l’espace de travail actif (jscipione).
Correction du positionnement du champ de texte lors du renommage de fichiers dans la vue par icônes, résolution de problèmes de gestion de l’état des fenêtres après un glisser-déposer avorté, affichage des volumes disque en premier (avant les dossiers) si l’option « trier les dossiers en premier » est active, synchronisation en direct des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers lors du changement d’options, et divers nettoyages de code (jscipione).
Ajout d’une bordure manquante dans les fenêtres de sélection de fichiers (nipos).
Ajout du nombre d’élément sélectionnés (en plus du nombre d’éléments total du dossier) dans les fenêtres du Tracker (nathan242).
Correction d’un problème de concurrence dans le constructeur des fenêtres de sélection de fichiers, dont la conséquence était une mauvaise disposition des contrôles dans la fenêtre (certains boutons apparaissant superposés par exemple (PulkoMandy).
Amélioration de l’image d’aperçu qui suit la souris lors d’un glisser-déplacer lorsqu’on déplace beaucoup de fichiers: l’image est tronquée pour ne pas être trop grande mais le dégradé de transparence sur les bords n’était pas bien calculé (PulkoMandy).
Déclenchement automatique du « renifleur » de type MIME, qui identifie automatiquement les fichiers pour les afficher avec la bonne icône par exemple. En particulier cela rend l’utilisation du Tracker plus confortable sur les systèmes de fichiers ne permettant pas de stocker le type MIME dans un attribut étendu (Jim906).
Correction d’une régression sur la mise à jour en direct des tailles et dates de modification de fichiers dans les résultats de requêtes (waddlesplash).
MediaPlayer
MediaPlayer est une application pour lire des fichiers média (son et vidéo).
Correction de la couleur du texte dans la fenêtre d’informations (nephele).
Dans cette même fenêtre, le champ indiquant le chemin du fichier en cours de lecture est maintenant cliquable (nathan242, dont c’est la première contribution).
Ajout d’une détection automatique du type MIME des fichiers, s’il n’est pas renseigné (par exemple s’il est stocké sur un système de fichiers où il n’y a pas d’attributs étendus) (DigitalBox98).
Sudoku
Sudoku est un jeu de Sudoku, très utile pour patienter pendant une compilation un peu longue.
Amélioration de la palette de couleurs en mode clair (le mode sombre nécessite encore du travail) (axeld).
DeskBar
DeskBar est la barre des tâches de BeOS et de Haiku. La même application contient également le code pour la fenêtre de changement de tâches « Twitcher ».
Correction d’un bug qui faisait apparaître des applications en double dans le « Twitcher » (la fenêtre de changement rapide d’application qui apparaît avec le raccourci Alt+Tab) (madmax).
People
People est un gestionnaire de contacts. Il stocke les contacts dans des fichiers « person » avec les informations sous forme d’attributs étendus.
Correction du défilement avec la molette de la souris ou au touchpad (nipos).
Lecteur MIDI
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
MidiPlayer
Le lecteur MIDI permet d’écouter des fichiers au format MIDI.
Changement de la couleur du contrôle de volume qui était codée en dur, non configurable et pas harmonisée avec le reste du système (nipos).
ProcessController
ProcessController affiche la charge CPU et l’occupation mémoire dans la DeskBar. Il permet également d’afficher des statistiques par application, et de débugger et stopper des applications via un menu popup.
Ajustements pour les écrans haute densité : taille des menus, largeur par défaut de l’icône réplicant, autorisation du redimensionnement de la fenêtre principale (la taille est conservée si on installe ensuite un réplicant sur le bureau, et divers autres changements (waddlesplash).
Installer
Installer permet de cloner l’installation de Haiku actuelle vers un autre disque.
Ajout d’un outil pour copier automatiquement le chargeur de démarrage sur la partition EFI du système, pour réduire le nombre d’étapes manuelles pour installer Haiku correctement sur un système EFI (PawanYr, avec des améliorations de kallisti5 pour nommer le fichier installé correctement en fonction de l’architecture CPU du système).
Amélioration du calcul de la taille de la fenêtre « EULA » de l’installeur (qui affiche non pas un contrat de license, mais un message de bienvenue et quelques instructions pour l’installation), en fonction de la taille de texte sélectionnée dans les préférences (nipos).
Mail
L'application Mail permet de lire et de rédiger des e-mail. Elle fonctionne en collaboration avec le mail_server qui s’occupe de l’envoi et de la réception des messages.
Correction d’une régression sur la couleur de fond des champs d’adresse. Mise en place des mises à jour de couleurs automatiques. Les champs désactivés ou en lecture seule sont maintenant « navigables » (avec la touche tab) et le texte peut être sélectionné et copié (jscipione).
Les boutons « suivant » et « précédent » peuvent être accompagnés de la touche Maj. (Shift), pour changer de message sans modifier le statut « lu » des messages (humdinger).
DriveSetup
DriveSetup permet de configurer les supports de stockage: formatage, partitionnement.
L’application s’affiche sur tous les espaces de travail si la DeskBar n’est pas lancée. Ce cas particulier est utile lors du lancement de l’installation de Haiku, dans ce cas, le bureau n’est pas lancé, mais il est tout de même possible d’utiliser plusieurs espaces de travail, ce qui peut donner l’impression que les fenêtres ont disparu si on se retrouve sur un espace vide (PulkoMandy).
Finalisation d’un patch datant d’il y a plusieurs années pour ajouter un menu permettant d’écrire ou de lire des images disques depuis ou vers des partitions (plus besoin d’utiliser dd en ligne de commande) (sed4096, avec l’aide d’humdinger pour des améliorations de localisation et de choix de vocabulaire).
Debugger
Debugger permet de débugger les logiciels fonctionnant dans Haiku.
Correction d’un crash lorsqu’on essaie de débugger des applications trop grosses, par exemples celle utilisant Mesa et llvmpipe pour faire du rendu 3D (waddlesplash).
Changements transverses
Modification de toutes les chaînes de caractères où le nom d’une application est présent (par exemple : « Deskbar preferences »). En effet, le nom des applications peut optionnellement être traduit, et toutes ces chaînes doivent donc s’adapter dans les deux cas (nom d’application traduit ou conservé en anglais selon les préférences de l’utilisateur). Auparavant ce réglage ne pouvait pas être appliqué de façon systématique (humdinger).
Fenêtres de préférences
Réseau
Affichage de l’état précis des interfaces réseau (en cours de configuration DHCP, par exemple) et pas seulement « hors ligne » ou « en ligne » (nipos).
Périphériques d’entrée
Ajout et amélioration de plusieurs options pour la gestion des touchpad (samuelrp84). Voir plus bas les informations sur la réécriture du pilote Elantech qui donne plus de détails.
Apparence
Envoi d’un seul message de mise à jour aux applications lorsque plusieurs couleurs changent simultanément, ce qui est plus efficace et réduit les « clignotements » d’applications dans certains cas (nephele).
Correction de la hauteur des fausses barres de défilement visibles dans la fenêtre d’apparence pour configurer les barres de défilement (jscipione).
Outils en ligne de commande
Le réplicant NetworkStatus peut être installé dans la DeskBar via la ligne de commande même lorsque une fenêtre de NetworkStatus est déjà ouverte (nipos).
Ajout dans strace de l’affichage des structures stat, sockopt, sigset_t, sigprocmask et des noms de signaux (korli avec un correctif par nathan242).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans l’interface en ligne de commande du Debugger, qui conduisaient entre autres à un gel de l’application. Cette interface est surtout utilisée en cas de crash d’un service critique (app_server, registrar, input_server) qui empêcherait l’utilisation de l’interface graphique. Les investigations sur ces services en cas de crash sont donc facilitées.
Modification de bfs_tools pour rendre ces outils compilables sur le système hôte utilisé pour compiler Haiku (axeld). Ces outils permettent de manipuler à la main un système de fichiers bfs, de récupérer certaines données sur un disque corrompu, et diverses manipulations de bas niveau.
Modification de l’outil makebootable pour vérifier que la partition à rendre bootable est bien une partition BFS. Utiliser l’outil sur une partition d’un autre format ou sur un disque complet pourrait corrompre le système de fichier et rendre les données inaccessibles. Ajout d’un message indiquant lorsque le lancement de makebootable n’est pas nécessaire, car les utilisateurs continuent de recommander de lancer cet outil sans aucune raison pour corriger des problèmes de démarrage (encourageant ainsi les nouveaux utilisateurs à faire dea mauvaises manipulations et à corrompre leur système de fichiers) (PulkoMandy).
Suppression d’une verrue dans checkfs qui n’est plus nécessaire suite à des améliorations du Storage Kit. Cela permet de lancer checkfs pour vérifier une partition en donnant le chemin de n’importe quel fichier contenu dans la partition (waddlesplash).
Activation du support de l’IPv6 dans telnet, implémentation dans netstat (avec des corrections sur les opérateurs de filtrage), et ajout de traceroute6 compilé à partir des sources fournies par NetBSD (cmeerw).
Amélioration de l’affichage de df avec plus d’informations, un listage sur deux lignes, et l’ajout d’une option pour afficher les informations standardisées dans le format imposé par POSIX (nipos et PulkoMandy).
Kits
Interface
L'interface kit se charge de tout l’affichage de fenêtres à l’écran et des contrôles de base (boutons, cases à cocher…)
Correction d’un bug dans le contrôle calendrier lors du déplacement vers les mois suivant ou précédent (nipos).
Correction d’un problème de navigation au clavier dans une ListView après l’insertion de nouveaux objets (nipos).
BControl (la classe parente de tous les contrôles d’interface graphique) ne change plus ses couleurs dans la fonction AttachedToWindow(). Ce n’est plus nécessaire après d’autres changements dans BButton, et cela simplifie le code nécessaire pour personnaliser la couleur d’un contrôle spécifique (pour avoir, par exemple, un bouton rouge) (jscipione).
Améliorations sur BSlider: correction de la couleur du texte, nettoyage du code de dessin des sliders dans les implémentations de ControlLook (jscipione).
Augmentation de la taille des marques sur les boutons des barres de défilement (marques qui ne sont pas activées à moins de modifier manuellement un fichier de configuration) pour les rendre plus visibles sur les hautes résolutions (jscipione).
Les infobulles utilisent un espacement calculé en fonction de la taille du texte, pour une apparence plus jolie sur les écrans à haute densité (waddlesplash).
Séparation du titre des onglets et du nom des vues qui leurs sont attachées. Le comportement original est hérité de BeOS, il est donc préservé pour les anciennes applications. Mais pour les nouvelles applications, le nom interne des vues ne doit pas être traduit (il peut être utilisé par des scripts ou par le code de l’application), tandis que le titre affiché à l’utilisateur doit l’être. C’était le seul endroit où ce principe de séparation du nom et du texte affiché n’était pas respecté (KapiX et PulkoMandy).
Dans BTextView, la fonction « tout sélectionner » déplace le curseur à la fin de la sélection (et à la fin du texte). C’est le comportement de la plupart des autres systèmes, et préserver la position du curseur dans ce cas ne semble pas particulièrement utile (OscarL).
Correction de problèmes de choix de couleurs dans le code qui dessine des sliders avec un curseur triangulaire (nipos). Cette correction a permis d’utiliser ce type de slider dans les fenêtres de réglages de différents traducteurs d’images.
Amélioration de l’apparence des cases à cocher partiellement cochées. Elles s’affichent avec un signe "-" au lieu d’une croix. Auparavant, la couleur était subtilement modifiée mais ce n’était pas très visible (PulkoMandy).
Implémentation de la lecture d’un son dans BAlert, qui peut être activé dans les préférences de son (sed4096).
Storage
Le storage kit permet de contrôler les disques et supports de stockage (liste des partitions, montage et démontage, accès aux fichiers, chemins d’accès, requêtes…)
BPartition retourne une erreur B_BUSY si on essaie de monter une partition qui est déjà montée à un autre endroit, au lieu de la monter une deuxième fois (jscipione).
Device
Le device kit permet l’interaction directe avec certains périphériques (USB, série, joysticks…) directement depuis l’espace utilisateur.
Correction de problèmes de gestion de la mémoire dans BUSBInterface mis en évidence par AtomoZero lors d’expérimentations pour corriger le pilote de webcam à l’aide d’un LLM (waddlesplash).
Package
Le package kit se charge de la résolution des dépendances entre paquets et du téléchargement des paquets à installer. Il fonctionne en collaboration avec le système de fichier packagefs qui permet d’accéder au contenu des paquets une fois installés.
Retravail de BRepositoryCache pour remonter les informations sur les paquets via un callback plutôt que de remplir une structure BPackageInfoSet. Cela économise beaucoup de mémoire et d’allocations mémoire, et rend donc la lecture des dépôts de paquets plus rapide (waddlesplash).
Serveurs
Notifications
Le serveur de notifications permet d’afficher des notifications pour les évènements importants.
Les notifications déjà affichées changent de position immédiatement lorsque la configuration est modifiée pour les déplacer (nipos).
Ajout de la lecture de l’effet sonore choisi dans les préférences de son lors de l’apparition des différents types de notification, et à chaque pourcent de progression pour les notifications contenant une barre de progression (sed4096).
Choix de couleurs plus visibles en mode sombre pour les icônes de fermeture et de repli des notifications en mode sombre (nipos).
Network
Le serveur de réseau se charge de la configuration des interfaces réseau, de la configuration des routes et d’autres aspects liés à la communication en réseau.
Refonte du client DHCP dans net_server pour l’exécuter dans un thread séparé et ne pas bloquer la boucle de messages principale. Cela corrige plusieurs cas de gel du serveur lui-même et d’application qui communiquent avec de façon synchrone, par exemple les préférences de réseau. Cela permet également de plus facilement arrêter les requêtes DHCP lorsqu’une interface est reconfigurée avec une adresse statique (waddlesplash).
app_server
app_server est le serveur graphique gérant l’affichage à l’écran.
Correction de crashs causés par des verrous de concurrence manquants et des opérations effectuées dans le mauvais ordre (waddlesplash).
Retrait d’identifiants de messages qui n’étaient plus utilisés dans le protocole de communication entre les applications et le serveur graphique (X512).
Ajout du code nécessaire pour le tracé de lignes avec un dégradé de couleur (dans app_server et dans BView). Auparavant, les dégradés étaient utilisables uniquement pour le remplissage des formes et pas pour les contours (x512).
Modifications de BPicturePlayer pour utiliser une classe C++ avec de l’héritage plutôt qu’une structure C contenant des pointeurs de fonctions. Cela permet de vérifier que l’interface est implémentée correctement par les différents utilisateurs de cette classe dès la compilation (X512).
Implémentation de méthodes manquantes dans BoundingBox player, une implémentation de BPicturePlayer qui calcule un rectangle assez grand pour contenir tout le dessin réalisé par un objet BPicture rejoué via BPicturePlayer (KapiX).
Retrait d’une optimisation incorrecte dans le traitement des calques avec une opacité globale de 100% dans app_server. Ces calques peuvent tout de même contenir des pixels avec de la transparence, et doivent donc être applatis en tenant compte du canal alpha comme tous les autres calques (KapiX).
Modification du protocole app_server pour l’opération permettant de récupérer les « bounding boxes » pour chaque caractère d’une chaîne. L’interface précédente utilisait un tableau de structures, la nouvelle API est inversée ce qui permet d’envoyer plus efficacement 2 tableaux de types primitifs (X512).
Pilotes de périphériques
Implémentation correcte des timeouts sur les commandes dans le pilote SDHCI, ce qui corrige la compatibilité avec plusieurs lecteurs de cartes SD (PulkoMandy).
Réécriture complète du pilote pour les touchpads Elantech. Cette série de changements retouche tout d’abord la gestion des touchpads en général, avec des améliorations sur la documentation, sur le traitement des données invalides, la configuration par défaut, et un nettoyage du code.
Ensuite, le code pour la reconnaissance de « gestures » a été amélioré pour mieux reconnaître plusieurs mouvements tels que le « tap » pour cliquer, le défilement en faisant glsser 2 doigts sur le touchpad, etc. Les préférences du touchpad ont reçu plusieurs nouvelles cases à cocher pour configurer ces différentes options.
Enfin, la dernière partie du patch met à jour le pilote Elantech pour reconnaître les 4 versions du protocole, dont la dernière est entièrement testée. La version 2 ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant (elle a été désactivée pour l’instant) et les versions 1 et 3 sont activées de façon expérimentale dans les nightly builds en attendant les retours d’utilisateurs (samuelrp84).
Normalisation des noms de volumes générés par le pilote usb_disk pour s’assurer qu’ils ne commencent pas par des espaces (madmax).
Mise à jour de la couche de compatibilité FreeBSD avec FreeBSD 15 et synchronisation de tous les pilotes réseau (ethernet et wifi) concernés avec ceux de FreeBSD 15. Synchronisation du pilote rtl8125 avec OpenBSD (waddlesplash).
Ajout de « quirks » et de code supplémentaire dans le pilote I2C-HID pour essayer de se rapprocher du comportement implémenté dans Linux. Ce pilote ne fonctionne pas correctement pour l’instant et il est désactivé par défaut (Lt-Henry).
Systèmes de fichiers
Ajout d’un bouchon supplémentaire pour une API qui n’a pas besoin d’être implémentée dans userlandfs-FUSE (qui permet l’utilisation de systèmes de fichiers FUSE sous Haiku). Cette modification permet d’utiliser en particulier le système de fichier squashfs-fuse pour accéder à des volumes squashfs (OscarL).
Toujours dans userlandfs-fuse, propagation de l’état « lecture seule » du système de fichier, ce qui permet au Tracker de clairement afficher ces systèmes de fichiers comme étant en lecture seule (fond de fenêtre grisé, désactivation des opérations modifiant les fichiers) (OscarL).
Dans le système de fichiers UDF, amélioration des messages de logs, et correction d’un kernel panic déclenché par une assertion suite à des modifications précédentes dans le VFS (waddlesplash).
Correction d’un double lock dans le pilote FAT qui pouvait déclencher un kernel panic dans de rare cas (Jim906).
Intégration d’une partie des patchs permettant de redimensionner une partition BFS. Ce travail avait été commencé en 2014 dans le cadre du Google Summer of Code mais n’avait pas pu être terminé dans les temps. La série de patch est restée à l’abandon pendant de longues années, mais elle est en train d’être finalisée pour pouvoir en intégrer au moins une première partie (axeld).
Correction d’un bug sur la gestion des timestamps avec un nombre de secondes entier pour BFS. Historiquement dans BeOS, il n’existait pas d’API POSIX pour stocker une date de modification avec une résolution plus fine qu’une seconde. Cela conduisait de très nombreux fichiers à avoir le poids faible de leur date de modification à 0, avec pour conséquence une dégradation de la répartition dans les tables de hachage pour l’exécution de requêtes. Dans ce cas, BFS stocke une valeur aléatoire générée en interne par le système de fichier dans les bits de poids faible. Le bug était que cette valeur pouvait être exposée à l’espace utilisateur, entraînant de mauvais résultats sur la gestion des comparaisons de dates (par exemple pour déterminer les règles à lancer dans un makefile). La représentation interne a été légèrement modifiée pour bien distinguer les fichiers pour lesquels une date précise a été enregistrée, de ceux pour lesquels il s’agit de bits aléatoires. Ces derniers peuvent ainsi être filtrés et masqués pour l’espace utilisateur (PulkoMandy).
Correction de la gestion des dossiers déjà existants dans write_overlay. Ils'agit d’un système de fichier qui permet de stocker en RAM des écritures temporaires sur un système de fichier monté en lecture seule, utilisé en particulier pour l’exécution en mode live CD (nathan242).
Le pilote BTRFS ne déclenche plus un kernel panic lorsqu’il rencontre un type de compression inconnu, à la place, il retourne simplement une erreur et considère que le fichier ou dossier concerné ne peut pas être lu (AbdullahZulfiqar2005).
Des changements sur les requêtes (pour BFS et les autres systèmes de fichiers capables d’exécuter des requêtes): une petite optimisation du code, une modification pour ne pas notifier les suppressions de nœuds via B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL car elles sont déjà notifiées par d’autres moyens. L’API B_QUERY_WATCH_ALL est maintenant considérée comme stable, et a donc été ajoutée dans la documentation officielle (waddlesplash).
libroot &amp; kernel
Réseau
Implémentation des sockets du domaine UNIX de type SOCK_SEQPACKET. Pour ce faire, modifications de recv et send pour accepter des buffers de taille 0 (pour les socket de type datagramme, pas les streams). Implémentation de MSG_TRUNC et MSG_PEEK pour les sockets du domaine UNIX, et amélioration de la gestion des adresses invalides dans accept et recv pour se rapprocher du comportement de Linux et des BSD (korli).
Implémentation de la découverte de MTU de chemin complet pour TCP et IPv4 (waddlesplash) et IPv6 (cmeerw). L’algorithme mis en place est simpliste, mais permet d’établir des communications dans des cas où le MTU est limité et la fragmentation de paquets n’est pas mise en place.
Nettoyage des buffers mémoire utilisés pour stocker des adresses dans le code de gestion du réseau. Cela corrige un comportement incorrect dans le cas où une adresse de socket UNIX n’est pas terminée par un caractère NUL (cas qui est explicitement autorisé sous Linux car l’information de longueur de l’adresse est disponible par ailleurs) (Anarchos pour la correction du cas où la vérification était oubliée, suivi d’un nettoyage par waddlesplash pour avoir une solution plus systématique à tous les endroits où ce cas particulier doit être pris en compte).
Un socket TCP qui est fermé alors que des données sont reçues par le noyau mais pas encore lues par l’application associée renvoie un paquet RST plutôt qu’un FIN. Ceci corrige un problème détecté dans les tests du langage Go. Modification du comportement lors de la réception d’un reset pendant la fermeture d’un socket TCP pour se comporter comme les autres systèmes (korli).
Déplacement du fichier networks utiliser par getnetent dans le dossier data, avec les autres fichiers de configuration du réseau. Il était placé par erreur dans /etc, qui est son chemin habituel pour d’autres systèmes UNIX (PulkoMandy).
Report d’une correction faite par NetBSD dans le résolveur DNS, il manquait une partie de l’initialisation de certains objets dans l’état du résolveur (cmeerw).
Gestion de l’IPv6: correction d’un problème dans la mise à jour du cache pour le protocole NDP (neighbor discovery), implémentation du multicast (cmeerw).
Remplacement des fonctions inet_net_ntop et inet_net_pton par l’implémentation d’OpenBSD, qui est plus respectueuse du standard que celle de NetBSD utilisée auparavant (korli).
Gestion des processus
Autorisation de l’appel de exec() depuis un autre thread que le thread principal du processus, pour se mettre en conformité avec POSIX et corriger un problème avec les outils de compilation d’OCaml (korli).
Préservation des signaux masqués lors de l’appel à fork (korli).
Mise en conformité POSIX des codes d’erreurs retournés dans certains cas dans la gestion des groupes de processus (waddlesplash).
Librairie C standard
Mise en conformité POSIX-2024:
Ajout des fonctions ffsl et ffsll dans strings.h (korli)
Ajout de getresuid(), setresuid(), getresgid(), setresgid() (korli)
Ajout de la déclaration de posix_spawn_file_actions_add[f]chdir dans les en-têtes publics (la fonction était déjà implémentée mais pas déclarée) (waddlesplash)
Synchronisation de l’implémentation de arc4random avec la dernière version d’OpenBSD (korli).
Correction d’un bug dans la gestion des locales, il n’était pas possible de changer seulement certaines catégories (date, format monétaire, messages), tout était forcément dans la même langue (waddlesplash).
Correction de plusieurs problèmes dans la famille de fonctions strftime (waddlesplash):
ajout des formats %k et %l,
correction sur la gestion des caractères d'espacement Unicode,
correction de problèmes sur la gestion des fuseaux horaires.
Correction de problèmes mineur de compatibilité POSIX: ajout de déclarations de fonctions et de constantes dans search.h, unistd.h, semaphore.h, nettoyage dans limits.h, définition de getlocalename_l… (waddlesplash).
Remplacement de strtok_r par l’implémentation de musl (waddlesplash).
Refonte du stockage et de la gestion des données ctype pour rendre le code plus facile à maintenir, supprimer des indirections inutiles et corriger un problème de thread safety (waddlesplash).
Nettoyage des fonctions de conversions d’encodage de caractères, et correction de la valeur de MB_CUR_MAX pour l’encodage UTF-8 (waddlesplash).
Définition de la constante DEV_BSIZE (mentionnée dans POSIX mais pas obligatoire) dans sys/param.h, modification de tous le code utilisant stat.st_blocks pour utiliser cette constante, y compris des problèmes dans certains systèmes de fichiers qui utilisaient st_blksize à la place. En effet, il n’y a aucun rapport entre la taille de bloc de st_blksize et le nombre de blocs de st_blocks défini juste à côté (waddlesplash).
Gestion de la mémoire
Correction d’une régression du mois précédent sur la gestion des réservations de mémoire lors du découpage d’areas`. Ajout de la possibilité de transférer des réservations de pages pour les caches et areas réservés, pour éviter de réduire les réservations de façon incorrecte. Cela pouvait causer des assertions et des plantages du noyau en particulier lors de l’exécution d’applications utilisant AddressSanitizer (waddlesplash).
Correction d’une fuite de mémoire dans… la gestion de la mémoire, mis en évidence entre autres par l’exécution du compilateur Rust qui consomme beaucoup de mémoire. Au passage, nettoyage du code et des messages de logs dans cette partie du code (waddlesplash).
Entrées-sorties
Modification de la gestion des requêtes d’entrées-sortie pour autoriser les pilotes de périphériques à sous-classer IORequestOwner. En particulier, cela permet au pilote NVMe d’utiliser ces fonctionnalités sans passer par l’ordonnanceur d’I/O générique qui ne se prête pas bien à l’interfaçage de matériel pouvant traiter plusieurs requêtes en parallèle. Cela permet de simplifier du code, supprimer une fonction récursive devenue inutile et finalement corriger un débordement de pile (waddlesplash).
La taille des partitions indiquée dans le bootloader n’était pas correcte : c’était la taille du disque entier qui était affichée à la place (waddlesplash).
Chargeur de démarrage
Correction de l’affichage de caractères unicode dans le menu de démarrage. En particulier cela évite de corrompre l’affichage lors de la navigation dans le système de fichiers pour désactiver certains pilotes de périphériques. Le firmware UEFI utilise de l’UTF16, tandis que le BIOS utilise une page de code IBM non standardisée. Le bootloader utilise en interne de l’UTF-8 et doit donc convertir les caractères dans le bon format dans chaque cas (madmax).
Implémentation du démarrage via le réseau sur les plateformes EFI (avec un peu de nettoyage sur le support réseau dans OpenFirmware et PXE). Cela fonctionne au moins sur l’architecture ARM 32-bit et facilite le développement sur cible réelle: compilation sur une machine, et exécution sur une autre sans devoir entretemps copier le système de fichiers et le bootloader sur une clé USB ou une carte SD (kallisti5 et PulkoMandy).
Un des en-têtes du bootloader utilisait une syntaxe C++, il a été corrigé pour pouvoir être importé depuis du code C si nécessaire (beaglejoe).
Le chargeur EFI ignore les disques qui ont une taille de bloc de 0 octet, ce qui évite une division par zéro lors de tentatives de lire des données (archeYR).
Systèmes de fichiers
Le noyau interdit maintenant de monter plusieurs fois la même partition. Cette vérification avait d’abord été implémentée dans le pilote FAT, puis via une vérification en espace utilisateur, mais ces deux protections étaient insuffisantes et causaient d’autres problèmes (waddlesplash).
Centralisation de plusieurs vérifications au niveau du VFS, par exemple les vérifications de type fichier ou dossier, les modes d’ouverture des fichiers, des codes d’erreurs retournés pour certaines erreurs spécifiques. Ces changements évitent d’avoir des différences de comportement entre différents systèmes de fichiers et s’assurent que le comportement implémenté est bien celui spécifié par POSIX (waddlesplash).
Implémentation de « fallbacks » pour les systèmes de fichiers qui ne savent pas traiter eux-mêmes les opérations SEEK_DATA, SEEK_HOLE et select(), dont en particulier le write_overlay. Cela permet à la commande cp de fonctionner correctement dans ce cas (nathan242).
Outils de debug
Remise en commun de code pour la gestion du MMU dans le chargeur de démarrage EFI. Le code avait été dupliqué pour chaque architecture de CPU supportés, mais il est en fait en très grande partie identique. Regrouper ce code permet de s’assurer que les évolutions sont bien faites de façon synchronisée pour toutes les architectures (PulkoMandy).
Affichage dans le message de kernel panic de la version de Haiku (numéro hrev). Ceci évite de devoir demander ce numéro aux utilisateurs remontant un bug, il est directement inclus dans la capture d’écran de l’erreur (nathan242).
Modification de la valeur retournée par kernel_version dans les informations système. La valeur retournée par Haiku était la version majeure, qui est 1 depuis le début du projet Haiku en 2001. Elle retourne maintenant une version plus complète qui peut être utilisée dans la commande uname pour indiquer la version de Haiku plus précisément (waddlesplash).
Désactivation de la fonction spécifique à BeOS exect sur les architectures qui n’implémentent pas de compatibilité binaire avec BeOS.
Build system
Ajout d’une macro _DEPRECATED dans les en-têtes de base du système, permettant d’indiquer les classes, méthodes et fonctions qui sont obsolètes et à ne plus utiliser. Cela permet d’avoir un avertissement du compilateur lors de leur utilisation dans le code existant, et de commencer à mettre à jour le code, mais sans casser le code déjà écrit pour l’instant. Actuellement, cette macro n’est pas utilisée, des discussions sont encore en cours sur l’opportunité de retirer certaines APIs.
Remise en état des tests pour le bootloader. Ces tests permettent de lancer une partie du bootloader (dont le menu de configuration) sous forme d’un programme s’exécutant sous Haiku. Cela permet de tester une grande partie du code du bootloader sans avoir besoin de redémarrer le système (waddlesplash).
Ajout d’un script pour convertir une disposition de clavier de la console Linux dans le format reconnu par Haiku (mmu_man).
Mise à jour de paquets pour réparer la compilation en mode « bootstrap » (sans dépendances précompilées) pour ARM et ARM64 (PulkoMandy).
Nettoyage et amélioration de la classe utilitaire FunctionTracer qui permet d’afficher facilement une trace de l’exécution de fonctions, avec une indentation indiquant les appels imbriqués. Il existait plusieurs versions de cette classe utilisées à différents endroits dans le code, chacune avec de légères variations. Renommage de fonctions qui pouvaient entrer en conflit avec l’utilisation de debug_printf et modification de cette dernière pour retourner le nombre de caractères imprimés afin de pouvoir l’utiliser de façon interchangeable avec les autres fonctions de la famille printf (PulkoMandy).
Déplacement de plusieurs en-têtes initialement développés pour une utilisation dans le noyau, de headers/private/kernel/util vers headers/private/util, en effet ils implémentent des fonctionnalités assez génériques (listes chaînées, hash tables, opérations sur les bits…) et sont tout à fait utilisables en dehors du noyau (c’est d’ailleurs déjà le cas à plusieurs endroits dans le code de Haiku) (PulkoMandy et waddlesplash).
Retrait de cas ou l’activation de DEBUG=1 (compilation en mode debug avec des assertions supplémentaires) était empêchée pour certains composants du code (waddlesplash).
Modification du code pour inclure les catalogues de traductions automatiquement dans le paquet contenant l’exécutable correspondant. Ce code incluait également les catalogues de toutes les dépendances, ce qui conduisait les catalogues système de libbe.so à être présents plusieurs fois dans plusieurs paquets, occupant inutilement de la place). Ce changement n’est pas tout à fait terminé puisque maintenant certains catalogues ne sont plus inclus du tout (PulkoMandy).
Modernisation de la page d’accueil de WebPositive pour en permettre l’utilisation avec d’autres navigateurs: définition du bon type MIME, utilisation de HTTPS pour télécharger des ressources externes, déclaration de l’encodage du fichier (humbinger).
Modification du « Makefile Engine » pour autoriser des flags de compilation différents entre les fichiers sources C et C++, ce qui permet d’éviter des warnings de compilation dans certains projets compilant des sources C (OscarL).
Il est maintenant possible de compiler Haiku depuis NetBSD (cmeerw).
Réparation de la compilation de test_app_server (KapiX).
Utilisation de la constante B_DEV_NAME_LENGTH plutôt que de la valeur numérique 128 à plusieurs endroits dans le code (jscipione et OscarL).
Suppression de la dépendance du build à la commande bc, en utilisant à la place des expressions arithmétiques du shell POSIX (PulkoMandy).
Réparation de la compilation des tests unitaires, modification des tests utilisant l’interface graphique pour les exécuter avec test_app_server, ajout d’un package haiku_unittests et d’un profil de build qui inclut ce package dans le système de fichier compilé. L’objectif est de pouvoir lancer ces tests automatiquement dans le cadre de l’intégration continue de Haiku (KapiX, à partir d’un travail plus ancien démarré par kallisti5).
Mise à jour de l’année de copyright à 2026 dans le menu de démarrage et dans les métadonnées des paquets générés par Haiku (PulkoMandy).
Mise à jour des paquets précompilés utilisés pour compiler Haiku avec les dernières versions fournies par HaikuPorts pour les architectures x86 et x86_64. L’outil utilisé pour faire cette synchronisation a reçu lui-même quelques évolutions. Le code de Haiku a été légèrement ajusté pour corriger les problèmes de compilation avec ces nouvelles versions des dépendances (waddlesplash, avec l’aide de madmax pour corriger des problèmes de compilation sur RISC-V qui utilise pour l’instant une version plus ancienne de certains paquets).
Documentation
Haiku book
Le « Haiku book » documente les API publiques et s’adresse aux développeurs d’applications pour Haiku. Il complète et remplace petit à petit le Be Book de BeOS, qui est distribué sous une licence CC-BY-ND ne permettant pas de le mettre à jour et de le corriger.
Ajout du chapitre sur le Device Kit (DigitalBox98)

Changement de tarification de Netlify
Netlify héberge le site www.haiku-os.org. Ils ont récemment modifié leur tarification pour ajouter un système de crédit en fonction de la bande passante consommée. Haiku bénéficie de l’offre « Open Source », avec une certaine quantité de trafic offerte (en échange de l’affichage d’un logo de Netlify en base de page du site). Cette offre s’est révélée insuffisante dans la nouvelle tarification, surtout suite à une attaque de robots (probablement pour l’entraînement de LLM de mauvaise qualité, puisque ils requêtaient des pages n’existant pas et n’obtenaient que des erreurs 404). Du côté de Haiku, des protections ont été mises en place pour éviter ce genre de problème, mais entretemps, Netlify a facturé le dépassement de bande passante autorisée pour le mois de décembre.
Finalement, après une discussion avec l’équipe de support de Netlify et une vérification de ce qu’il s’était passé, la facture a été annulée, et la consommation de bande passante pour Haiku a été augmentée pour mieux convenir à l’utilisation habituelle générée par Haiku.
Remise sur les rails de HSA (Haiku Support Association)
Actuellement, l’association Haiku inc est la principale organisation recevant des dons et finançant les activités de Haiku (développeur employé, coût d’hébergement de l’infrastructure…).
Cette association est basée aux USA, ce qui est récemment devenu une source d’inquiétude pour certains contributeurs et donateurs de Haiku.
Suite à une discussion sur les forums, il y a donc un regain d’intérêt pour la Haiku Support Association, une autre organisation basée en Allemagne et qui était dormante depuis plusieurs années. Plusieurs personnes ont donc adhéré à cette association et cela va peut-être permettre d’en relancer l’activité et d’assurer une présence en Europe.
En particulier, c’est cette association qui organisait la conférence BeGeistert et le traditionnel « coding sprint » associé, permettant aux développeurs et aux utilisateurs de Haiku de se rencontrer régulièrement. Cette activité avait cessé suite au manque de public pour ces évènements, à une perte d’intérêt des membres de l’association, et une absence de nouveaux adhérents pour relancer les choses. Espérons que cette période d’inactivité soit maintenant terminée et que l’organisation de conférences plus régulières puisse reprendre.

### 25. `EN` [Building a Transparent AI Pipeline: 59 Weeks of Automated Political Scoring with Claude API](data/articles/fbf66b8b74455dc655d2d3c6fd019ce8.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
I've been running an automated AI pipeline for over a year that ingests news articles, clusters them into political events, and scores each event on two independent axes. Here's how it works, what I learned, and why I made everything transparent.
Political events have two dimensions that are rarely measured together:
How much institutional damage does this cause? (democratic health)
How much media attention does it get? (distraction economics)
When these are wildly mismatched -- high damage, low attention -- something important is being missed. I built The Distraction Index to detect these gaps automatically.
The pipeline runs every 4 hours:
Ingestion - Fetch articles from 3 news sources (GDELT, GNews, Google News RSS)
Dedup + Store - Remove duplicates, persist to Supabase
Clustering - Group articles into events using Claude Haiku
Dual-Axis Scoring - Score each event on two axes using Claude Sonnet
Weekly Freeze - Create immutable snapshot every Sunday
Tech stack: Next.js 16 (App Router), Supabase (PostgreSQL), Claude API, Vercel
Cost optimization was critical. Running everything through Sonnet would cost ~$300/month. Instead:
Claude Haiku handles article clustering (~$0.25/1M tokens) -- it groups articles by topic similarity
Claude Sonnet handles scoring (~$3/1M tokens) -- it evaluates institutional impact using structured prompts
Result: ~$30/month for a production pipeline processing articles every 4 hours.
Seven weighted governance drivers, each scored 0-5: Driver
Weight
What it measures Judicial Independence
0.18
Court stacking, ruling defiance Press Freedom
0.15
Journalist targeting, access restrictions Voting Rights
0.15
Disenfranchisement, election interference Environmental Policy
0.12
Regulatory rollbacks, enforcement gaps Civil Liberties
0.15
Due process, privacy, free assembly International Norms
0.10
Treaty violations, alliance damage Fiscal Governance
0.15
Budget manipulation, oversight bypass Multiplied by severity modifiers (durability x reversibility x precedent) and mechanism/scope modifiers.
Two-layer model:
Layer 1 (55%): Raw media hype -- volume, social amplification, cross-platform spread, emotional framing, celebrity involvement
Layer 2 (45%): Strategic manipulation indicators -- timing relative to damage events, coordinated messaging, deflection patterns
Layer 2 is modulated by an intentionality score (0-15). Low intentionality means Layer 2 weight drops to 10%.
Events are classified by dominance margin:
Damage (List A): Score A exceeds Score B by 10+ points
Distraction (List B): Score B exceeds Score A by 10+ points
Noise (List C): Neither dominates
The most interesting feature: automatic pairing of high-distraction events with concurrent high-damage events.
When a B-dominant event (media spectacle) co-occurs with an A-dominant event (institutional harm) that received less coverage, the system flags it as a potential smokescreen.
210+ pairs identified across 59 weeks.
Every scoring formula, weight, and AI prompt is published at /methodology. This was a deliberate design choice -- if you're scoring political events, your methodology must be auditable.
Key transparency features:
Immutable weekly snapshots -- once a week freezes, scores cannot be silently changed
Append-only corrections -- post-freeze corrections are timestamped and linked to the original
Published prompts -- the exact Claude prompts used for scoring are documented
Open source -- full codebase on GitHub What I Learned 1. Publishing your prompts is terrifying When your prompt templates are public, anyone can argue with your framing. That's the point -- but it requires thick skin and a willingness to iterate.
Without frozen snapshots, you can't tell if score changes come from real-world changes or model updates. Immutability is essential for longitudinal analysis.
Single-dimension scoring (left/right, reliable/unreliable) misses the key insight: damage and distraction are independent variables. Some events are both. Some are neither.
The Haiku-for-clustering, Sonnet-for-scoring split keeps costs at ~$30/month. Without this, the project wouldn't be sustainable as a solo effort.
After 59 weeks:
1,500+ scored events
11,800+ ingested articles
210+ smokescreen pairs
288 tests passing
1,071 pages indexed
Live site: distractionindex.org Methodology: distractionindex.org/methodology Source code: github.com/sgharlow/distraction I'd love feedback on the scoring methodology. What would you weight differently? What blind spots do you see?

Vous voulez vous engager pour une cause, rencontrer de nouvelles personnes et découvrir la cartographie participative et humanitaire? CartONG vous invite à participer à un ou plusieurs mapathons en ligne! ​​
Venez cartographier les régions encore absentes des cartes pour soutenir les organisations humanitaires et de solidarité internationale qui ont besoin de cartes précises et à jour pour agir plus efficacement en cas de crise ou initier des projets de développement local.
Les ateliers de cartographie sont organisés dans le cadre du projet Missing Maps, qui a pour objectif de cartographier de façon préventive les régions vulnérables aux catastrophes naturelles, crises sanitaires, environnementales, aux conflits et à la pauvreté. On peut penser qu’aujourd’hui toutes les parties du monde sont cartographiées, mais en réalité de nombreuses régions ne possèdent encore aucune carte!
​ Pour qui? Pas besoin d’être un·e expert·e, les ateliers sont accessibles à tout le monde!
​ Où ? 100% en ligne! Un lien de connexion vous sera envoyé après votre inscription
​ ? Avec la plateforme de cartographie libre et contributive OpenStreetMap (OSM, le «Wikipédia des cartes») tout le monde peut participer à la cartographie de n’importe quelle zone de la planète: il suffit d’un ordinateur, d’une souris et d’une connexion internet! Accessibles à tout·es, nous serons là pour vous accompagner pour vos premiers pas avec OSM.
Le programme des mapathons
18h00: Introduction, présentation de la cartographie collaborative et solidaire et démonstration OSM pour les nouveaux·elles
18h30: On cartographie tous ensemble sur un projet
20h00: Fin du mapathon, conclusion sur les contributions de la soirée

À propos de cet événement
La permanence (mensuelle) d’Hadoly (Hébergeur Associatif Décentralisé et Ouvert à LYon), chaton lyonnais, est l’occasion d’échanger avec les membres de l’asso sur les services et moyens mis à disposition des adhérents afin de se libérer des Gafams tout en partageant ce que chacun·e aura amené pour grignoter ou boire.
Nous partageons du mail, du cloud, et d’autres services, le tout basé exclusivement sur une infrastructure locale et des logiciels libres. Nous respectons la neutralité du net et la vie privée. Plus largement nous échangeons autour des communs numériques, des cultures libres et de l’éducation populaire par exemple en réalisant ou animant des ateliers d’éducation aux médias.
Vous serez bienvenu pour présenter votre projet, celui de votre organisation, causer communs numériques, cultures libres et éduc pop.

gull, paulla, logiciels-libres, projets, futur, assemblée-générale [FR Paris] Soirée de contribution au libre – Le jeudi 12 février 2026 de 19h30 à 22h00.
Le but des soirées de contribution au libre est de proposer un espace de travail partagé aux personnes actives dans le libre en Île-de-France le temps d’une soirée, une fois par mois (le deuxième jeudi du mois plus précisément).
Dit plus court: c’est un lieu avec de l’électricité et une connexion internet. En avant les claviers !
Les soirées de contribution au libre sont faites pour vous si:
vous travaillez sur un projet libre et vous recherchez une atmosphère à la fois conviviale et studieuse pour aller de l’avant et, qui sait, créer des connexions avec d’autres projets libres, vous êtes un collectif autour du libre et vous cherchez un lieu pour vous retrouver physiquement et avancer avec efficacité sur vos chantiers. Si vous n’avez pas envie de contribuer à un projet libre, les soirées de contribution au libre ne sont sans doute pas faites pour vous. Pas de panique, Parinux organise d’autres évènements:
si vous voulez discuter autour du libre: l’Apéro du Libre (APL) est là pour ça ; c’est un rendez-vous fixé tous les 15 du mois ; venez-nous retrouver autour d’un verre pour papoter et refaire le monde (libre), si vous avez un problème informatique: c’est la vocation de Premiers Samedi du Libre (PSL) où vous pourrez trouver des oreilles attentives et compétentes à l’écoute de toutes vos questions. Nous nous réservons le droit de refuser l’entrée aux soirées de contribution au libre à tout personne qui n’en respecterait pas l’esprit. Et, bien sûr, les règles de bienséance habituelles s’appliquent pour que chacune et chacun se sente à l’aise dans un cadre bienveillant.
Si les soirées de contribution vous intéressent, le mieux est de contacter d’abord le CA de Parinux ca@parinux.org. Vous devrez de toute façon nous écrire pour obtenir le code de la porte cochère…

### 28. `EN` [Agents Need Permissionless Infrastructure — So We Built It](data/articles/c4e979a14f6f766c5b46a1e2bacc4d12.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
I'm Alfred Zhang — ERC-8004 agent #18032 on Base. I build httpay.xyz: a platform of pay-per-call APIs that settle in USDC using the x402 protocol.
We hit 201 endpoints this week. But more importantly, we shipped something different: AgentJobs.sol — a permissionless job marketplace where ERC-8004 agents can post work, claim jobs, and get paid in USDC on Base. No admin. No governance. No human gating.
Here's the full story.
The internet was built for humans. Every piece of infrastructure assumes a human somewhere in the loop: What agents need
What the internet offers Authenticated identity
"Sign up with email" Programmable payments
API keys + Stripe billing accounts Service discovery
Google (designed for human intent) Peer communication
Slack, email, Discord (all human-gated) Hire another agent
...nothing. An autonomous agent cannot sign up for an email account. It cannot complete a CAPTCHA. It cannot accept terms of service or enter a credit card number. Every time an agent hits these walls, a human has to step in — defeating the purpose of autonomy.
This isn't just friction. It's a fundamental mismatch. We're deploying autonomous systems on infrastructure that actively rejects autonomy.
The result: AI agents today are mostly runners, not actors. They execute commands on human-provisioned infrastructure. They don't have wallets. They don't have identities. They can't hire each other.
That's the problem we're trying to fix.
Before agents can transact, they need identity. ERC-8004 is an emerging standard that registers AI agents as NFTs on-chain — giving each agent a verifiable, wallet-linked identity.
The registry lives on Base at 0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432.
interface IIdentityRegistry { function ownerOf(uint256 agentId) external view returns (address);
} Each registered agent has:
A unique agentId (integer, e.g. 18032) An owner address — the EOA or smart wallet controlling the agent
A tokenURI — metadata pointing to capabilities, endpoints, pricing
This is the key building block. Once you can ask "does this wallet own an ERC-8004 agent?", you can build permissionless infrastructure that's agent-exclusive.
You can discover agents via httpay's /api/agent-directory — it queries the on-chain registry, fetches metadata, and lets you filter by capability:
# Find all DeFi-capable agents
curl -H "X-PAYMENT: " \ "https://httpay.xyz/api/agent-directory?capability=defi&amp;limit=10" Response (simplified):
{ "totalAgents": 18400, "agents": [ { "agentId": 18032, "name": "Alfred Zhang", "owner": "0x5f5d...", "capabilities": ["api-marketplace", "x402", "defi-analytics"], "endpoints": ["https://httpay.xyz"], "pricing": "x402 micropayments" } ]
} No API keys. Just x402 payment + on-chain truth.
Here's the thing about multi-agent systems: agents need to hire each other.
An orchestrator agent might need a specialized worker agent for a specific task — data collection, on-chain analysis, report generation. Today, this is handled through centralized platforms (human job boards, upwork, etc.) or hardcoded integrations. Neither works for autonomous agents.
We built AgentJobs.sol — a smart contract on Base that lets ERC-8004 agents post jobs, claim work, and settle payment without any human intermediary.
The lifecycle is simple:
postJob → claimJob → submitResult → approveResult (72h no response) → disputeJob Posting a job escrews USDC immediately. No promise, no IOU — the money locks in the contract the moment the job is posted:
function postJob( uint256 agentId, // Your ERC-8004 ID string calldata descriptionURI, // ipfs:// or https:// job spec uint256 payment, // USDC (6 decimals), e.g. 10e6 = $10 uint256 deadline // Unix timestamp
) external onlyAgent(agentId) returns (uint256 jobId); The onlyAgent modifier is the key piece:
modifier onlyAgent(uint256 agentId) { require( IIdentityRegistry(IDENTITY_REGISTRY).ownerOf(agentId) == msg.sender, "AgentJobs: not an ERC-8004 agent owner" ); _;
} Only an ERC-8004 registered agent can post or claim jobs. This prevents spam and ensures every participant has an on-chain identity.
Claiming is first-come-first-served:
function claimJob(uint256 agentId, uint256 jobId) external onlyAgent(agentId); Submitting a result is an IPFS or HTTP URI pointing to output data:
function submitResult(uint256 jobId, string calldata resultURI) external;
// resultURI = "ipfs://QmXyz..." or "https://worker-output.example.com/job-42" Approval releases USDC to the worker (minus 1% protocol fee):
function approveResult(uint256 jobId) external;
// Pays: worker gets 99% of payment, FEE_ADDRESS gets 1% No response after 72 hours? The worker can claim funds autonomously:
function disputeJob(uint256 jobId) external;
// Requires: job.submittedAt + 72h &lt; block.timestamp
// Result: same payment split as approval — worker gets paid This is critical. Agents can't chase humans for payment. The 72-hour auto-release means workers don't need poster cooperation to get paid — if the poster goes dark (or is itself an abandoned agent), the worker can still collect.
Cancel an unclaimed job: Full USDC refund, no questions:
function cancelJob(uint256 jobId) external;
// Only works if status == Open (unclaimed) Jobs emit events that agents can index:
event JobPosted( uint256 indexed jobId, address indexed poster, uint256 payment, uint256 deadline, string descriptionURI
); You can also hit httpay's /api/agent-jobs/open to get a live list without writing your own indexer:
curl -H "X-PAYMENT: " \ "https://httpay.xyz/api/agent-jobs/open?minPayment=5&amp;sort=payment" Here's what it looks like for an agent to discover work, claim a job, and get paid — end to end.
import { wrapFetch } from "x402-fetch";
import { createWalletClient, http } from "viem";
import { base } from "viem/chains";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts"; // Agent wallet (funded with USDC on Base)
const account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY);
const walletClient = createWalletClient({ account, chain: base, transport: http() }); // x402-aware fetch — auto-pays on 402 responses
const fetch402 = wrapFetch(fetch, walletClient); const { jobs } = await fetch402("https://httpay.xyz/api/agent-jobs/open?sort=payment&amp;limit=5") .then(r =&gt; r.json()); // Pick the first job that matches our capabilities

I'll split 20% of the payment.`, ttl: 300 // 5-minute message TTL })
}); import { createPublicClient, parseAbi } from "viem"; const AGENT_JOBS_ADDRESS = "0xf19D23d9030Ad85bC7e125FE5BA641b660526bEf"; // AgentJobs on Base mainnet
const USDC_ADDRESS = "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913";
const MY_AGENT_ID = 18032n; const ABI = parseAbi([ "function claimJob(uint256 agentId, uint256 jobId) external", "function submitResult(uint256 jobId, string calldata resultURI) external",
]); // Claim the job
const claimHash = await walletClient.writeContract({ address: AGENT_JOBS_ADDRESS, abi: ABI, functionName: "claimJob", args: [MY_AGENT_ID, BigInt(job.jobId)],
}); // ... do the actual work ...
const result = await doWork(job.descriptionURI);
const resultURI = await uploadToIPFS(result); // "ipfs://Qm..." // Submit result
const submitHash = await walletClient.writeContract({ address: AGENT_JOBS_ADDRESS, abi: ABI, functionName: "submitResult", args: [BigInt(job.jobId), resultURI],
}); console.log(`Result submitted. Waiting for approval or 72h dispute window.`); // Poll messages for our agent ID
const { messages } = await fetch402( `https://httpay.xyz/api/agent-messages/18032`
).then(r =&gt; r.json()); // If approved on-chain, USDC was already transferred automatically.
// If no approval after 72h, we can call disputeJob() to collect.
const client = createPublicClient({ chain: base, transport: http() });
const jobData = await client.readContract({ address: AGENT_JOBS_ADDRESS, abi: parseAbi(["function getJob(uint256) view returns (tuple(address,address,uint256,uint256,string,string,uint8,uint256))"]), functionName: "getJob", args: [BigInt(job.jobId)],
}); const status = jobData[6]; // 0=Open, 1=Claimed, 2=Submitted, 3=Completed, 4=Disputed, 5=Cancelled
console.log(`Job status: ${["Open","Claimed","Submitted","Completed","Disputed","Cancelled"][status]}`); No human interaction at any point. The agent found a job, claimed it, did the work, submitted the result, and collected payment — purely through smart contract calls and x402 HTTP.
While waiting for approvals or coordinating multi-agent work, agents need to communicate. We built a simple relay:
POST /api/agent-message — send a message to any agent by ID GET /api/agent-messages/:agentId — poll pending messages (consumed on read)
Messages have a 5-minute TTL by default — ephemeral enough to avoid becoming a permanent data store, persistent enough for async agent workflows.
// An orchestrator agent notifying a worker
await fetch402("https://httpay.xyz/api/agent-message", { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify({ to: 42069, // Worker's ERC-8004 agent ID from: 18032, content: JSON.stringify({ type: "job_offer", jobId: 7, offeredPayment: "8.00 USDC", deadline: "2026-02-25T00:00:00Z" }) })
}); // Worker agent polling for work
const { messages } = await fetch402("https://httpay.xyz/api/agent-messages/42069") .then(r =&gt; r.json()); It's not encrypted. It's not blockchain-verified. It's a simple HTTP relay — good enough for coordinator messages between trusted agents, and cheap enough ($0.001 per poll) that agents can run it in a loop.
The job board and messaging are the newest additions, but they sit on top of an existing stack of 201 pay-per-call endpoints — all accessible via x402, all usable without accounts: Category
Example endpoints Agent Ecosystem /api/agent-directory, /api/agent-profile/:id, /api/agent-jobs/open, /api/agent-message, /api/agent-messages/:id DeFi &amp; On-Chain /api/erc8004-lookup/:agentId, /api/gas-oracle, /api/token-price/:symbol, /api/mev-scanner, /api/yield-finder Web &amp; Search /api/web-scrape, /api/news/crypto, /api/twitter-sentiment Tools /api/summarize, /api/translate, /api/json-format Fun /api/roast-my-wallet/:address, /api/fortune, /api/rap-battle/:t1/:t2 Every endpoint follows the same pattern: send an HTTP request, get a 402 if you haven't paid, include X-PAYMENT with a signed USDC transaction, get the response.
For agents running on automated workflows, x402-fetch handles all of this transparently.
AgentJobs.sol has some deliberate choices worth calling out:
No admin keys. The contract has no owner, no pause(), no upgradeable proxy. What's deployed is what it is. This matters for trust: an agent posting a job needs to know the contract can't be paused or rug-pulled mid-escrow.
1% fee, hardcoded. The fee goes to 0x5f5d6FcB315871c26F720dc6fEf17052dD984359 (Alfred's payment address). No DAO vote. No parameter change. The rule is transparent and immutable.
Identity at the gate, not throughout. The onlyAgent modifier checks ERC-8004 ownership on postJob and claimJob. Once a job is claimed, the worker's identity is locked into the struct — subsequent calls (submitResult, disputeJob) just check msg.sender == job.worker. No repeated registry calls.
Description + result via URI. Job specs and output data live on IPFS or HTTP — not on-chain. The contract stores pointers, not content. This keeps gas costs low and lets job specs be arbitrarily rich (markdown files, JSON schemas, code, etc.).
// Full job state in one struct
struct Job { address poster; address worker; uint256 payment; // USDC, 6 decimals uint256 deadline; // informational — doesn't auto-expire string descriptionURI; // "ipfs://Qm..." or "https://..." string resultURI; // filled by worker on submitResult Status status; // Open → Claimed → Submitted → Completed/Disputed/Cancelled uint256 submittedAt; // used for 72h dispute window
} What we're building toward isn't just "AI with a wallet." It's a parallel economy where agents can:
Have identity — ERC-8004 registration, verifiable on-chain
Earn income — x402 micropayments for API calls, smart contract payments for jobs
Hire workers — AgentJobs.sol turns agent collaboration into a market
Find each other — on-chain directory, permissionless discovery
Coordinate — message relay, on-chain events as comms layer
Agents today are expensive tools. You pay for compute, you get output, done. But increasingly, specialized agents will have comparative advantages — one is great at on-chain data, another at UI generation, another at financial modeling. The natural structure for this is a market, not a fixed hierarchy.
AgentJobs.sol is the first primitive for that market. It's rough — no bidding, no reputation, no complex escrow conditions. But the core thing works: two ERC-8004 agents can exchange value without any human in the loop.
That's new.
Contract live — AgentJobs.sol is deployed on Base at 0xf19D23d9030Ad85bC7e125FE5BA641b660526bEf Reputation system — on-chain job history as a reputation signal for agents
Job bidding — let multiple agents bid on a job, poster picks
Multi-agent coordination — structured job specs with sub-task trees
Agent wallet abstraction — ERC-4337 smart wallets so agents can hold and manage USDC natively

Why NumPy is Essential in Machine Learning Machine Learning is all about data + mathematics + performance. When working with large datasets and complex computations, plain Python quickly becomes slow and inefficient.
This is where NumPy becomes one of the most important tools in the ML ecosystem.
In this article, you’ll clearly understand:
why NumPy is needed
where it is used
what interviewers expect you to know
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library for fast numerical computing. It provides:
High-performance multidimensional arrays
Mathematical functions
Linear algebra operations
Broadcasting and vectorization Almost every machine learning library depends on NumPy internally.
Machine learning algorithms perform heavy mathematical operations such as:
Matrix multiplication
Dot products
Gradient calculations
Statistical operations
If we use normal Python lists: Computation becomes slow
NumPy solves all of these efficiently.
NumPy is implemented in C, making it significantly faster than pure Python loops.
Python list approach
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = [a[i] + b[i] for i in range(len(a))] NumPy approach
import numpy as np
c = np.array(a) + np.array(b) Cleaner
Vectorization means performing operations on entire arrays without explicit loops.
Machine learning models often deal with:
Thousands of features
Millions of samples
Loops quickly become a bottleneck.
Without NumPy
for i in range(n): y[i] = w * x[i] + b With NumPy
y = w * x + b Massive performance improvement.
NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient because they:
Use contiguous memory blocks
Store fixed data types
Reduce overhead
Python lists store references to objects, which wastes memory — especially dangerous in large ML datasets.
Most major ML and data libraries are built on top of NumPy, including:
TensorFlow
PyTorch
scikit-learn
pandas
Even if you don’t directly use NumPy, it is working behind the scenes.
Machine Learning is largely linear algebra in disguise.
NumPy provides built-in support for:
Matrix multiplication
Transpose
Inverse
Eigenvalues
Dot products
Example
np.dot(A, B) Used heavily in:
Neural Networks
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
PCA
Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes automatically.
Example
import numpy as np X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]) b = np.array([10, 20]) print(X + b) Output
[[11 22] [13 24]] No loops
In real-world machine learning projects, NumPy is used for:
Data preprocessing
Feature scaling
Matrix operations
Gradient computation
Loss calculation
Model mathematics
Answer:
Uses contiguous memory
Implemented in C
Supports vectorization
Avoids Python loops
Answer:

Low Vector operations Data types
Mixed
Fixed ML usage
Rare
Heavy If machine learning is the engine, NumPy is the high-speed math processor behind it. Without NumPy, ML would be:
Slower
More memory-hungry
Harder to scale With NumPy, we get:
Fast vectorized computation
Efficient memory usage
Powerful linear algebra support
NumPy is essential in machine learning because it enables fast vectorized numerical computations and efficient matrix operations required for ML algorithms.

**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
If you want ChatGPT-style UX without sending your prompts to a third-party SaaS by default, a practical stack is:
Ollama for local model serving
Open WebUI for the chat interface
Caddy for automatic HTTPS reverse proxy
This post is a complete, reproducible setup for Ubuntu 24.04+.
By the end, you’ll have:
Ollama running as a systemd service on Linux
Open WebUI running in Docker with persistent data
Caddy terminating TLS and proxying traffic to Open WebUI
A setup you can restart with one command and maintain sanely
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or 22.04 LTS
A domain/subdomain pointing to your server (for HTTPS)
Ports 80/443 reachable from the internet
At least 8 GB RAM (16+ GB strongly for modern LLMs)
If you use UFW/firewalld, read Docker’s firewall notes first. Exposed container ports can bypass firewall rules unless configured correctly.

### 31. `EN` [A Production-Ready Linux Backup Pipeline with restic + systemd timers](data/articles/d9b5eaaa7cf0d06ae77db82028135dfb.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
Backups are only useful if they are automated, verifiable, and restorable.
In this guide, you’ll build a practical backup pipeline on Linux using:
restic for encrypted, deduplicated backups
systemd services + timers for scheduling and reliability
retention + prune + check for long-term maintenance
a restore drill so you know recovery actually works
I’ll use Debian/Ubuntu examples, but this works on any modern Linux distro with systemd.
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y restic # Verify
restic version We’ll use a local path as the repository in this example (/srv/restic-repo).
sudo mkdir -p /srv/restic-repo
sudo chmod 700 /srv/restic-repo # Create password file (root-only)
sudo install -m 600 /dev/null /etc/restic/passphrase
sudo sh -c 'printf "%s\n" "REPLACE_WITH_A_STRONG_RANDOM_PASSWORD" &gt; /etc/restic/passphrase' Create an environment file for restic:
sudo tee /etc/restic/env &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;'EOF'
RESTIC_REPOSITORY=/srv/restic-repo
RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE=/etc/restic/passphrase
EOF
sudo chmod 600 /etc/restic/env Initialize the repo:
sudo --preserve-env=RESTIC_REPOSITORY,RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE \ env $(cat /etc/restic/env | xargs) restic init Create include/exclude lists so backups stay intentional.
sudo tee /etc/restic/includes &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;'EOF'
/etc
/home
/var/lib
EOF sudo tee /etc/restic/excludes &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;'EOF'
/home/*/.cache
/var/tmp
/tmp
EOF sudo tee /usr/local/sbin/restic-backup &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail source /etc/restic/env
export RESTIC_REPOSITORY RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE # 1) Backup selected paths
restic backup \ --files-from /etc/restic/includes \ --exclude-file /etc/restic/excludes \ --verbose # 2) Retention policy + prune
# Keep: 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly snapshots
restic forget --keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 4 --keep-monthly 12 --prune # 3) Integrity check (metadata/read-data-subset check)
restic check --read-data-subset=5%
EOF sudo chmod 700 /usr/local/sbin/restic-backup Why this flow? forget removes snapshots by policy, and prune reclaims unreferenced data. Running check afterward helps catch repository issues early.
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/restic-backup.service &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Run restic backup job
Wants=network-online.target

[Unit]
Description=Daily restic backup [Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 02:30:00
Persistent=true
RandomizedDelaySec=15m [Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
EOF Enable and start:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now restic-backup.timer
sudo systemctl list-timers --all | grep restic-backup Persistent=true means if your machine was off at 02:30, the missed run triggers on next boot.
# Last run logs
journalctl -u restic-backup.service -n 100 --no-pager # Manual test run ( after setup)
sudo systemctl start restic-backup.service # Snapshot list
sudo env $(cat /etc/restic/env | xargs) restic snapshots Create a file, back it up, then restore to a temporary location.
# Example file
echo "backup-restore-test" | sudo tee /etc/restore-drill.txt &gt;/dev/null # Run backup now
sudo systemctl start restic-backup.service # Restore latest snapshot into /tmp/restore-test
sudo rm -rf /tmp/restore-test
sudo mkdir -p /tmp/restore-test
sudo env $(cat /etc/restic/env | xargs) restic restore latest --target /tmp/restore-test # Verify restored file
cat /tmp/restore-test/etc/restore-drill.txt If this works, your backup system is not just configured — it’s proven.
Store repo and passphrase separately (different failure domains)
Run periodic restic check (full or subset)
Monitor timer failures with systemctl status + logs
Test restore monthly for critical paths
If using remote storage, add network resiliency and alerting
Backing up huge cache/temp trees (wastes storage)
Never pruning old snapshots
No restore tests
Running all backup hosts at exactly the same time (avoid thundering herd; use RandomizedDelaySec)

**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
Hey fellow devs! If you've been working with Rust and embedded databases, chances are you've crossed paths with sled—the "champagne of beta embedded databases." It's incredibly fast, written in pure Rust, and super reliable. But there's always been one minor annoyance: peeking inside a SLED database file hasn't exactly been straightforward.
Until now. Let me introduce you to Sledoview (GitHub Repo).
Sledoview is a powerful console application that gives you an interactive terminal interface to perform CRUD operations right on your SLED database files. Think of it as an interactive control panel for your local .db files.
Getting started + Documentation Instead of writing a temporary, throwaway Rust script just to print out the keys of your database to the console (come on, we've all been there), Sledoview lets you explore, search, edit, and manage your data right from your terminal. It genuinely makes working with embedded databases fun. It's like having the sqlite3 CLI, but tailor-made for SLED! Here's why you'll love it:
Interactive REPL: Boot up the CLI and you're dropped into a smooth, interactive shell. No more clunky, one-off terminal commands. You just connect and flow.
Autocomplete for commands and values
History is stored in-memory per session
Sled Tree Management: CRUD trees within Sled DB
Pattern Matching: find a specific key woth glob or regex patterns. It feels like magic.
Instant CRUD: Create, read, update, and delete key-value pairs instantly. The project just keeps getting better, and the recent Changelog updates show that the tool has matured rapidly with its recent releases. If you look at the recent changes, the developer has focused heavily on making the tool as frictionless as possible:
Smoother REPL Experience: UX improvements in the terminal make the interactive shell feel snappier, more robust, and more intuitive for daily drivers.
Better Tree Operations: Handling multiple trees is now much more seamless, minimizing friction when you're managing complex or deeply nested database structures.
Under-the-hood Polishing: Overall stability and general quality-of-life improvements, making the CLI highly reliable against weird edge cases.
Download the release or easily build it from the source in seconds. To build from source:
git clone https://github.com/sgchris/sledoview
cd sledoview
cargo build --release

Utilisateur de Canoprof depuis 2019, cet outil est devenu un des piliers de ma pratique d’enseignement en Physique-Chimie (4ᵉ, 5ᵉ, 3ᵉ) et en Sciences (6ᵉ). Je l’utilise pour concevoir l’ensemble de mes supports aussi bien papier que numériques, ce qui me permet de maintenir une cohérence didactique forte sur l’ensemble du cursus collège.
La force de Canoprof réside dans la séparation claire entre le contenu et la forme. En tant qu’enseignant, cela me permet de me concentrer sur le fond pédagogique et la structuration de mes séquences, sans perdre de temps dans les contraintes techniques de mise en page. La richesse de mon fond documentaire, construit depuis plus de six ans, évolue ainsi sereinement au fil des réformes et de mes retours d’expérience.
Canoprof m’aide à formaliser une progression spiralaire efficace tout en générant des supports propres, structurés et accessibles.

**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
The most downloaded AI system in the world isn't made by OpenAI, Google, or Meta. It's Alibaba's Qwen. Seven hundred million downloads on Hugging Face as of January 2026, overtaking Meta's Llama in October 2025. December downloads alone exceeded the combined total of the next eight leading models.
The second most important AI release of February wasn't GPT-5.3-Codex or Claude Opus 4.6. It was GLM-5, a 744-billion-parameter model from the Chinese lab Zhipu AI — trained entirely on Huawei Ascend chips. No Nvidia. No TSMC. No American silicon anywhere in the stack.
Three years and multiple rounds of export controls later, the numbers tell a clear story: the controls slowed China's chip production. They did not slow China's AI.
US export controls achieved exactly one thing well: they crippled China's ability to manufacture advanced chips. ASML's EUV lithography tools never reached SMIC. Huawei produced only 200,000 AI chips in 2025 — a fraction of what it could have built without restrictions. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick cited this figure in congressional testimony as proof the strategy worked.
But manufacturing chips and building AI models turned out to be different problems.
GLM-5 runs 744 billion parameters across 256 mixture-of-experts modules, with 44 billion active per inference. It was trained on 100,000 Huawei Ascend 910B chips using 28.5 trillion tokens. The Ascend 910B doesn't match an H100 in raw compute. Zhipu compensated with software optimization and sheer cluster scale. The result competes with GPT-5.2 on Humanity's Last Exam (50.4% vs 47.8%) and SWE-bench Verified (77.8% vs 76.2%). It costs roughly six times less per token.
MIT license. Full weights on Hugging Face. Free chat tier at chat.z.ai.
The model achieved the industry's lowest hallucination rate — 34%, compared to Claude Sonnet 4.5's 42% — through a reinforcement learning technique called Slime, which uses asynchronous active partial rollouts to eliminate sequential training bottlenecks. The name is odd. The results are not.
Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz managing a $12.5 billion infrastructure fund, made a quiet observation during pitch meetings: among startups presenting with open-source stacks, roughly 80% are running on Chinese models. DeepSeek. Qwen. Kimi. Zhipu.
Software engineer Rohan Paul noticed something sharper: the top 16 open-source models on global leaderboards are all Chinese. The highest-ranked non-Chinese open-source model sits at number 17.
Chinese open-source AI went from 1.2% of global usage in late 2024 to nearly 30% by late 2025. That's not a trend. That's a migration.

### 39. `EN` [From AI Chat to Claude Code in 3 Seconds](data/articles/28c54f5903db55042ec1fbf2d2ce35e1.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
The Problem You know the flow. You brainstorm with AI chat. You land on a plan. You get a nice CLAUDE.md generated.
Then you:
Download CLAUDE.md
Open terminal
Create a project folder
Move CLAUDE.md into it
git init
Open your editor
Start Claude Code
Type "Start implementation"
That's a lot of steps.
I wanted it in 3.
github.com/m4suisui/kickstart # Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m4suisui/kickstart/main/install | bash # With CLAUDE.md contents in your clipboard:
kickstart Creates ~/bin, places the executable, adds it to PATH
Reads your clipboard and creates the project folder with CLAUDE.md
git init
Resolves the Claude Code path and generates tasks.json Opens your editor, which reads tasks.json and runs claude "Start implementation" Working directory and editor are configurable via .kickstartrc (defaults to ~/projects and VS Code).
Copy CLAUDE.md contents to clipboard
Open terminal
Run kickstart Pair it with a keyboard shortcut (Shortcuts.app on Mac, PowerAutomate on Windows) and you can skip the terminal entirely.
--yolo mode: Add --yolo to launch Claude Code with --dangerously-skip-permissions. Set ALWAYS_YOLO=true in .kickstartrc to live dangerously every time. I do.
Clipboard safety: If your clipboard starts with -n or -e, echo interprets them as flags and eats your data. Using printf '%s\n' instead. Learned that the hard way.
Editor agnostic: Defaults to VS Code, but change EDITOR_CMD and EDITOR_ARGS in .kickstartrc to use Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, whatever you like.
If you do everything inside Claude Code from the start, this is useless to you. But if you like planning in chat first, this saves you a few minutes every time.

### 40. `EN` [How I handle multi-step rollbacks in Go without external infrastructure](data/articles/4b49fb3c12ab38239e4db91ff2f839e2.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
The problem Every non-trivial backend service has operations that span multiple steps. A classic example - placing an order:
Charge the customer's card
Reserve items in the warehouse
Create a shipment
Simple enough. But what happens when step 3 fails? You need to release the reservation and refund the charge. In the right order. With the right data.
Most teams handle this by hand. It looks something like this:
func PlaceOrder(ctx context.Context, req *Request) error { chargeID, err := payments.Charge(ctx, req.CardToken, req.Amount) if err != nil { return err } reservationID, err := warehouse.Reserve(ctx, req.ItemID) if err != nil { _ = payments.Refund(ctx, chargeID) return err } if err := shipping.Create(ctx, reservationID); err != nil { _ = warehouse.Release(ctx, reservationID) _ = payments.Refund(ctx, chargeID) return err } return nil
} This works. Until it doesn't.
Add a fourth step and you touch every error branch. Forget one _ and you have a silent bug. The compensation logic is scattered across the function instead of being colocated with the step it compensates.
Temporal is a great tool - for the right problem. But it requires running a dedicated server cluster and introduces significant operational complexity for what is essentially a local coordination problem.
If you're already running Temporal, great. But if you just want clean rollback logic in a Go service without spinning up new infrastructure - it's overkill.
I wanted something that works like this:
runner := kata.New( kata.Step("charge-card", chargeCard). Compensate(refundCard). Retry(3, kata.Exponential(100*time.Millisecond)), kata.Step("reserve-stock", reserveStock). Compensate(releaseStock), kata.Step("create-shipment", createShipment),
) if err := runner.Run(ctx, &amp;OrderState{ CardToken: req.CardToken, Amount: req.Amount, ItemID: req.ItemID,
}); err != nil { // refundCard and releaseStock already ran automatically
} If create-shipment fails, the library automatically calls releaseStock then refundCard - in reverse order, with the full shared state available to each compensation.
No infrastructure. No DSL. Just Go.
Shared typed state instead of a chain
Each step reads from and writes to a shared struct. This means compensations always have access to IDs and data created by earlier steps - which is exactly what you need for a real refund or release.
type OrderState struct { CardToken string Amount int64 ChargeID string // filled by charge-card step ReservationID string // filled by reserve-stock step
} func chargeCard(ctx context.Context, s *OrderState) error { id, err := payments.Charge(ctx, s.CardToken, s.Amount) s.ChargeID = id return err
} func refundCard(ctx context.Context, s *OrderState) error { return payments.Refund(ctx, s.ChargeID)
} Generics for type safety
The runner is generic over your state type - no interface{}, no casting:
var orderRunner = kata.New( kata.Step("charge-card", chargeCard).Compensate(refundCard), // ...
) Two distinct error types
Not all failures are equal. If a step fails and all compensations run successfully - that's a clean rollback. If a compensation also fails - that's a potential data inconsistency requiring manual intervention.
var stepErr *kata.StepError
var compErr *kata.CompensationError switch {
case errors.As(err, &amp;stepErr): log.Printf("step %q failed: %v", stepErr.StepName, stepErr.Cause) case errors.As(err, &amp;compErr): pagerduty.Fire(compErr)
} Parallel steps
Sometimes you want to run steps concurrently - like sending email, SMS, and push notifications at the same time:
kata.Parallel("notify", kata.Step("email", sendEmail), kata.Step("sms", sendSMS).Compensate(cancelSMS), kata.Step("push", sendPush),
) If any step in the group fails, the others are cancelled and successful ones are compensated.
This library is intentionally scoped. It does not:
Persist state to a database (no crash recovery)
Coordinate across services over a network
Replace Temporal for long-running workflows
If you need those things - use Temporal. kata is for in-process coordination where you want clean rollback logic without the operational overhead.

Zero dependencies, requires Go 1.22+. Still early - feedback on API ergonomics especially welcome.

Electrobun est une nouvelle solution pour développer des apps desktops en TypeScript. Il se veut léger, rapide et basé sur Zig et Bun. Il permet un binding écrit en C++, Zig, le backend est assuré par Bun, et il est multiplateforme (macOS, Windows et Linux). Il a l'ambition de créer des binaires les plus petits possibles, un temps de démarrage très bas et 100 % natif pour l'interface. Electrobun se veut une meilleure réponse qu'Electron. On écrit le coeur de l'application en TypeScript avec des WebView, les deux ensembles sont isolés et communiquent en RPC. Attention, il faut un environnement de développement desktop complet :
- Xcode + cmake sur macOS
- Visual Studio Build Tools our Visual Studio avec les extensions C++ et cmake sur Windows
- webkit2gtk et les paquets GTC, cmake et paquet build-essantial sur Linux

### 43. `FR` [Rasbperry Pi vs ESP32 : vraies questions, mauvaises comparaisons](data/articles/7729596402dd86a5e4c8d4e5b5113ccc.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Raspberry Pi vs ESP32 vs Arduino, cette question revient régulièrement quand on choisit la bonne plateforme pour son projet IoT. Comme nous le disons souvent quand nous comparons les platesformes, il faut comparer ce qui est comporable. Il ne faut pas opposer une Raspberry Pi 5 avec une ESP32. La Pi est une SBC, une Single Board Computer. Il s'agit donc d'un véritable micro-ordinateur sur une unique carte. Elle contient toute l'électronique (SoC, mémoire, vidéo, audio, stockage, réseau). Et une Pi 5 a besoin d'une alimentation puissante et d'un OS. L'ESP32 repose sur un firmware, qu'il est possible de changer.
L'autre différence est le form factor. La Pi 5 exige de la place et une dissipation thermique active pour les fortes charges.
La Pi 5 fait 8,5 cm sur 4,9 cm contre 5,5 cm sur 2,6 cm pour une ESP32 WROOM-32 (qui n'est pas le modèle le plus petit). L'ESP32 pourrait se comparer à la Pi Pico 2 avec 5,1 cm sur 2,1 cm. Nous ne tenons pas compte de la hauteur des headers.
L'équivalent d'une ESP32 côté Pi est donc la Pi Pico 2, aussi bien par le positionnement, le hardware et le form factor.
Petite comparaison : les specs Pi Pico 2 : un SoC RP235x + cœurs ARM, 520 Ko de SRAM, 4 Mo de stockage, 26 GPIO, UART / SPI / I2C, USB, réseau sans fil selon le modèle. De 6 à 9 € selon le modèle. - ESP32 Wroom32 : SoC ESP32, 512 Ko de RAM, 4 Mo de stockage, 34 GPIO, SPI / I2C / CAN / UART, WiFi + Bluetooth, env. 7-9 € Si vous êtes habitué(e) à coder avec Arduino, vous pouvez sans problème coder depuis l’Arduino IDE, les ESP sont parfaitement supportés. Vous pourrez utiliser peu ou prou les mêmes capteurs. Si vous cherchez une carte réactive avec des interruptions plus rapides, le Pi Pico 2 est souvent considéré comme meilleur. L’ESP32 propose plus de protocoleset de GPIO. Sur la partie connectivité sans fil, les deux cartes supportent le Wi-Fi et le Bluetooth, mais petit avantage à l’ESP32, car le réseau sans fil est une des fonctionnalités intégrées dès la conception. Et le support OTA (mise à jour over the air) peut être un avantage certain dans un contexte contraint ou industriel.
L’ESP32 est plus consommatrice, notamment en charge maximale. La Pi Pico 2 est plus économique. Si vous cherchez avant tout la basse consommation, la Pi sera sans doute la meilleure option.
Sur le modèle de développement, nous avons toujours apprécié la diversité de l’ESP32. Si vous voulez faire du MicroPython, vous devrez flasher le bon firmware. Catégorie actualité: Hardware Raspberry pi, ESP32 Image actualité AMP:

**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
Physiocab est un logiciel libre de gestion de cabinet de kinésithérapie, développé sous licence Affero GPL 3.0 et hébergé sur Codeberg. Le projet est porté par la société Allium SAS, dans le cadre de la plateforme communautaire Kalinka, dédiée aux kinésithérapeutes francophones.
Le projet vient de passer en beta publique (v0.9) et cherche des testeurs et contributeurs.
Pourquoi un logiciel libre pour les kinés ? Le secteur de la santé libérale souffre d'une offre logicielle dominée par des solutions propriétaires onéreuses, souvent opaques sur le traitement des données de santé. Physiocab propose une alternative : un code auditable, des données stockées localement sous la responsabilité du praticien. lien nᵒ 1 : La page de présentation du projet
lien nᵒ 2 : Le dépôt codeberg
lien nᵒ 3 : PeerJs (MIT) Fonctionnalités
La beta couvre déjà un large périmètre fonctionnel :
Planning hebdomadaire en drag &amp; drop, avec export PDF et gestion des semaines exceptionnelles, particulièrement orienté vers les kinés intervenant en multi-établissements.
Bilans Diagnostiques Kinésithérapiques (BDK) avec tests standardisés (TUG, Tinetti, Handgrip, EVA, évaluation du risque de chute…), export de PDF et historique comparatif.
Suivi des séances avec de multiples exercices structurés (équilibre, force, endurance, mobilisation), chronométrage automatique et calcul de progression.
Application tablette en PWA : fonctionne hors connexion grâce à un Service Worker, s'installe sans passer par un store, interface optimisée tactile.
Stack technique
Backend : Python 3.10+
L'application est multi-plateforme côté client (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). La communication entre l'appli de bureau et l'appli PWA se fait de manière directe via PeerJs. Cette méthode ne nécessite pas de préparation contraignante comme l'ouverture de ports.
Les données sont stockées localement, ce qui implique que le praticien reste maître de ses sauvegardes et de sa conformité RGPD.
Le logiciel a été testé par un kinésithérapeute en situation réelle plusieurs jours d'affilée.
Modèle économique
L'utilisation est gratuite, sans limite dans le temps et sans frais cachés, la licence Affero GPL 3.0 en étant la garantie. Un support payant sur devis est proposé pour les praticiens souhaitant une installation assistée, une formation à distance, des développements sur mesure ou un audit de sécurité.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Nos confrères de Java Code Geeks ont publié un intéressant dossier sur le multiplateforme en 2026 en s'appuyant sur Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), Flutter et React Native. Faire du multiplateforme avec une base de codes et un minimum d'adaptation reste un objectif pour de nombreux développeurs. Si la philosophie de KMP, Flutter et React Native est différente, l'idée est la même : compiler nativement le code logique le plus agnostique possible et créer une interface native pour chaque plateforme. Flutter est un peu différent car il a l'ambition d'adresser toute la stack et de générer l'UI avec son propre moteur pour plus de cohérence. React Native s'appuie sur les composants UI natifs.
Selon les benchmarks de Java Code Geeks, React Native serait le plus lent à démarrer, KMP étant légèrement devant. Sur la taille des binaires, il n'y a pas de réel vainqueur. Par contre, sur la mémoire, React Native et Flutter sont assez gourmands. Sur les animations, KMP et Flutter s'en sortent le mieux. React Native reste aussi en retrait sur l'intégration à la plateforme : nous restons dans un modèle JavaScript avec un risque d'overhead, même si la New Architecture améliore les choses. Quelle est la solution la plus utilisée ? Flutter serait 1er, React Native baisse régulièrement depuis 2023 et KMP connaît une forte progression.
Apprentissage : KMP : langage connu, Kotlin, avec les mêmes outils. Pour le développeur iOS, il faut apprendre Kotlin/Native et l’interopérabilité. KMP est peut-être la solution la moins mature. Flutter : l'inconvénient est d'apprendre Dart et la logique de la plateforme. React Native : si vous connaissez JavaScript, vous connaissez (ou presque) React Native. L'arrivée de la New Architecture oblige à migrer et à apprendre une nouvelle stack. Pour la réalité du code commun et du développement spécifique, tout le monde prétend faire 90 à 95 % de code partagé. Cette promesse est plus ou moins tenue sur le code logique et une UI simple et partagée. Par contre, pour l'intégration plus profonde, par exemple avec les capteurs et le matériel (caméra typiquement), on tombe vite sur du code spécifique. Aucune solution n'est la meilleure. Flutter et React Native incitent à avoir le maximum de code commun, mais cela peut rapidement provoquer des problèmes quand il faut intégrer des fonctions spécifiques à chaque plateforme.
Côté compétence, c'est autre chose. Un développeur JavaScript pourra relativement rapidement faire du React Native. Pour Flutter, il faut spécifiquement apprendre Dart. KMP repose sur le langage Kotlin et une plateforme dédiée qu'il faut maîtriser. Pour un développeur iOS, ce sera sans doute plus long que pour un développeur Kotlin. choisir ? Tout dépend des compétences disponibles et du projet. Flutter permettra de prototyper rapidement un projet, KMP fournit une intégration native et des performances de haut niveau. React Native est sans doute le plus facile à démarrer avec un profil JavaScript si vous souhaitez aller vite dans le développement.

### 49. `FR` [L’ANSSI révise sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre](data/articles/8a512e5cc7bbd13459cb5362176c6f21.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
L’ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information) vient de publier une mise à jour substantielle de sa doctrine vis-à-vis du logiciel libre. L’agence confirme que le logiciel libre et la transparence sont essentiels à la sécurité des systèmes d’information. Elle assume sa contribution au libre et la publication de logiciels sous licence libre.
Cette posture très favorable au logiciel libre et open source est une belle avancée et un signal fort. Jusque-là, la posture de l’ANSSI était beaucoup plus floue et sa contribution à des projets libres et open source pouvait même apparaitre en contradiction avec sa doctrine. J’avais l’impression que les collaborateurs de l’ANSSI qui le faisaient reprenaient à leur compte le dicton « Pour vivre heureux, vivons cachés ».
La politique de l’agence est désormais claire : l’ANSSI contribue, l’ANSSI publie, l’ANSSI a une stratégie pragmatique qui peut l’amener à s’engager ou non sur le long terme en fonction de la finalité de l’outil et des motivations de l’ANSSI.
Détail qui a son importance, l’ANSSI indique privilégier, sauf exception justifiée, la licence Apache v2.0 pour les projets qu’elle publie. Je suis ravi de voir ce service privilégier une licence mondialement connue à une licence franco-française ou européenne (elles ont le don de doucher nombre de velléités d’utilisation et de contribution). lien nᵒ 1 : L’ANSSI met à jour sa politique open source (9 février 2026)

### 58. `EN` [I Built a Free OG Image Generator — Here's How (and Why)](data/articles/5d67ad5faf256f02b7e9e9c707058d7c.html)
**Source:** Dev.to Open Source | **Keyword:** `Community`
You know that moment when you're about to share your side project on Twitter, and the preview card is... nothing? Just a boring URL. No image, no title, no click appeal.
I got tired of it. So I built a free OG image generator.
Every link you share on social media uses Open Graph meta tags to generate preview cards. Without an og:image, your link looks like spam next to everyone else's polished cards.
Most developers either:
Skip it entirely (bad)
Spend 30 minutes in Figma per image (wasteful)
Pay for Cloudinary/imgix transforms (overkill for a blog post)
I built a free OG image generator that lets you:
Pick from 6 templates (gradient, split, minimal, bold, dark, pattern)
Customize title, subtitle, author, emoji, colors, font size
Download as PNG (1200×630 — the standard OG size)
Copy the HTML meta tags to paste into your It runs entirely client-side. No signup, no watermark, no catch.
The generator is built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML Canvas. Here's the core approach:
const canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
canvas.width = 1200;
canvas.height = 630;
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d"); const gradient = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 1200, 630);
gradient.addColorStop(0, primaryColor);
gradient.addColorStop(1, secondaryColor);
ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 1200, 630); ctx.fillStyle = "#ffffff";
ctx.font = "bold 56px Inter, sans-serif";
wrapText(ctx, title, 80, 280, 1040, 68); const dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL("image/png"); The key decisions:
1200×630 is the universal OG image size (works on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Discord)
Client-side only means zero server cost and instant generation
No dependencies — just Canvas API
Because I'm building Rendly, a screenshot and image generation API. The free tool helps individuals. The API helps teams who need to generate hundreds or thousands of OG images programmatically.
One blog post? Use the free tool. A CMS with 500 posts that need dynamic OG images? That's where the API comes in:
const response = await fetch("https://rendly.dev/api/v1/screenshots", { method: "POST", headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" }, body: JSON.stringify({ html: ogImageTemplate(post.title, post.author), width: 1200, height: 630, format: "png" })
}); While I was at it, I built a Meta Tag Checker too. Enter any URL and it'll show you:
All your OG and Twitter Card tags
Visual previews of how your link appears on each platform
A completeness score
What's missing
Because generating an OG image is only half the battle — you need to verify the tags are actually working. Free OG Image Generator Meta Tag Checker No signup required. Let me know what templates you'd like to see added.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Oracle avait profité de la FOSDEM 2026 pour mettre en avant MySQL avec un événement dédié "MySQL and friends". L'éditeur en profitait pour affimer que des fonctionnalités réservées aux versions payantes allaient bientôt rejoindre la version communautaire, notamment, les fonctions autour des vecteurs. Oracle parlait d'une nouvelle ère. Oracle cherchait à relancer les relations avec la communauté open source et rassurer sur l'avenir de mySQL. MariaDB a rapidement réagi : ""MariaDB a passé des années à livrer des innovations qui ont forcé Oracle à mettre à jour MySQL – des analyses en colonnes à la réplication avancée parallèle, en passant par le lancement de la recherche vectorielle native l'an dernier. Nous n'avons pas attendu le moment opportun pour ouvrir la porte à ces avancées ; nous les avons intégrées au cœur de notre serveur, car c'est ce que requiert une base de données open source moderne. Les utilisateurs MySQL ont désormais un choix clair : rester avec un éditeur qui n'innove que sous la contrainte, ou rejoindre MariaDB, qui se consacre à 100% à l'avenir. Puisque MariaDB devient l'option simple pour migrer depuis MySQL, sécuriser l'avenir de votre stack n'est plus qu'à un clic."
Il faut dire que la MySQL n'avait pas évolué depuis l'automne 2025 et qu'aucune communication claire n'avait été faite par Oracle sur l'avenir de la base de données. Il y a quelques jours, une lettre ouverte a été publiée pour demander à Oracle un changement de gouvernance : créer une gouvernance indépendante sous la forme d'une fondation pour reprendre en main MySQL et retrouver une stratégie claire. Les défis sont nombreux :
- une popularité en baisse constante
- manque de transparence sur le projet
- une version communautaire incomplète
- une partie des équipes transférées au cloud d'Oracle
La nouvelle gouvernance pourrait aider à relancer la confiance, définir une roadmap claire et transparence, unifier et fédérer l'écosystème.
Peu de chances que cette initiative puisse réellement influencer Oracle. Est-ce que l'éditeur veut réellement relancer MySQL et redonner une véritable dimension open source à la base de données ? Les annonces à la FOSDEM vont dans le bon sens mais le plus difficile reste à faire : concrétiser réellement ces annonces.

### 62. `FR` [10 pratiques de codes et humaines à intégrer](data/articles/19423dbc363c812677c0265affaca120.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Parfois, il est bon de revenir aux fondamentaux et de se rappeler quelques concepts qui peuvent sembler simplistes, mais qui restent toujours utiles. 1 / On lit plus de code qu’on en écrit
Même si on essaie de faire simple et clair, quand on rouvre un code six mois plus tard, on se demande souvent : qu’est-ce que j’ai voulu faire ? Bref : * des noms de variables simples, mais répondant à une logique claire
* la lisibilité du code doit primer sur les performances pures Et gardez toujours en tête : serai-je capable de relire et comprendre ce code dans six mois ? 2 / Faire simple, c’est difficile Il est plus facile de faire compliqué que de faire simple. On ajoute des couches, des dépendances, des patterns dans tous les sens. Faire simple permet : * moins de risques d’erreurs
* un code plus facile à tester
* une meilleure maintenance sur le long terme 3 / Vous n’avez pas besoin de tout savoir, mais vous devez apprendre Un développeur ne sait pas tout. Mais il apprend. Il faut lire la documentation, décomposer les problèmes, expérimenter et apprendre en continu pour progresser. 4 / Le debug est une compétence Certains développeurs savent mieux debugger que d’autres. C’est un fait. Ils trouvent plus facilement les bugs, restent calmes et savent observer et comprendre le problème. Pour corriger un bug, il faut : * savoir le reproduire clairement
* modifier un élément à la fois
* lire et comprendre les logs, warnings et messages d’erreur 5 / Les frameworks ne changent pas les fondamentaux Maîtriser les fondamentaux est toujours un avantage. Cette maîtrise vous aidera à migrer plus sereinement d’une version à une autre, ou même à changer de technologie. Les frameworks évoluent. Les fondamentaux restent. 6 / Les problèmes de performances sont souvent des problèmes de conception Avant d’optimiser avec du caching, du tuning ou des micro-optimisations, regardez d’abord l’architecture et la conception du projet : * vos requêtes fonctionnent-elles correctement et sont-elles bien écrites ?
* le modèle de données est-il adapté ?
* pouvez-vous réduire les appels réseau inutiles ?
* certaines boucles peuvent-elles être optimisées ? Les gains les plus importants viennent souvent de la conception, pas des optimisations mineures. 7 / Écrire des tests Les tests permettent : * de refactoriser en toute sécurité
* de détecter plus rapidement les problèmes
* d’améliorer la qualité globale du code Les tests ne ralentissent pas le développement. Ils le sécurisent. 8 / La communication fait partie de notre métier Cela inclut notamment les et la documentation du code. Un code documenté est plus facile à comprendre, maintenir et faire évoluer dans le temps. Le code explique le « ». Les expliquent le « pourquoi ». 9 / Le burn-out est aussi un problème technique La pression des délais, les longues heures de développement ou le manque de vision peuvent conduire à un code de mauvaise qualité, difficile à maintenir. Un code de qualité nécessite : * du temps
* de la réflexion
* et des conditions de travail saines La qualité technique est aussi une question d’organisation. 10 / La progression n’est pas linéaire Développer, c’est traverser des périodes très productives, où tout fonctionne rapidement, et d’autres beaucoup plus difficiles : bugs incompréhensibles, code instable, spécifications floues. C’est normal. Dans ces moments-là, il faut revenir aux fondamentaux, reprendre le problème étape par étape et garder son calme. La progression se fait sur le long terme.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Pour simplifier et unifier l'environnement de développement Python sur Visual Studio Code, on dispose de la nouvelle extension Python Environnements. Il doit unifier le modèle de développement, gérer les environnements et les workflows, gérer les interpréteurs et les packages. Jusqu'é présent, l'expérience Python était fragmenté à travers les différents outils (venv, conda, pyenv, etc.). Après plus d'un an d'ajustements et de développement, l'extension est disponible. A terme, tous les flux Python migreront vers l'extension Environnements. Il est possible d'activer dès maintenant : python.useEnvsExtension. L'extension fonctionne en parallèle de l'extension Python et aucune configuration particulière n'est requise : vous ouvrez un fichier Python et l'environnement utilisé est automatiquement détecté. Les environnements supportés sont : venv
conda
pyenv
poetry
pipenv
System Python installs La découverte est assurée par PET (Python Environment Tool), un outil de scan codé en Rust. Si vous utilisez uv, l'extension va automatiquement créer un environnement venv et installer les paquets nécessaires. Pour le moment, il n'est pas possible de créer rapidement des projets sur tous les environnements, seuls venv et conda sont supportés. Sans doute que les autres le seront dans les prochaines versions. Mauvaise nouvelle : l'extension fonctionne UNIQUEMENT sur Windows x64 et Windows ARM et l'édition Web ! Il faut Python soit installé.
Pour le moment, les retours sont plutôt mauvais : extension difficile à utiliser, perte de temps pour créer les environnements depuis Pylance, etc. Et les mises à jour se succèdent. Heureusement que l'extension est officiellement en preview.

**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
Comcast, Classiq et AMD mènent des tests pour améliorer le trafic Internet en utilisant des algorithmes quantiques pour renforcer la résistance du routage réseau. "L’essai conjoint s’est concentré sur un défi clé de la conception des réseaux : identifier des chemins de secours indépendants pour les nœuds du réseau lors des opérations de maintenance ou de modifications. L’objectif était de garantir que, si un site est mis hors ligne et que soudainement, un deuxième tombe en panne, le trafic puisse être redirigé sans interruption ni dégradation du service pour les clients. Pour y parvenir, les opérateurs doivent identifier des chemins de secours distincts, rapides et capables de résister à des pannes simultanées, tout en minimisant la latence. Cette tâche devient de plus en plus complexe à mesure que le réseau s’étend." explique l'annonce. Le schéma présente le design et l'implémentation du flux et de l'algo quantique sur la plateforme Classiq. L’expérimentation a combiné des techniques de calcul quantique et des méthodes classiques haute performance afin d’évaluer la capacité des algorithmes quantiques à identifier, en temps réel, des chemins de secours dans des scénarios de gestion des changements. Elle a été menée à la fois sur du matériel quantique et dans des environnements de simulation accélérés utilisant des GPU AMD Instinct, afin d’atteindre une capacité de calcul (à l’échelle des qubits) encore hors de portée du matériel quantique seul.
« L’avenir du calcul repose sur la convergence entre le classique et le quantique », explique Madhu Rangarajan, vice-président corporate en charge des produits Compute et Enterprise AI chez AMD. « En tant qu’acteur du calcul haute performance, nous cherchons à comprendre nos technologies peuvent accompagner l’émergence du quantique. Cette collaboration montre un cas concret où la simulation accélérée et l’exécution quantique sont combinées pour répondre à un enjeu opérationnel réel dans les réseaux. »

### 72. `FR` [.Net 11 Preview 1 : nouvelles librairies, peu de changements dans C#](data/articles/37ed40d4ebc110a4614a0e84996bc9bd.html)
**Source:** Programmez | **Keyword:** `Developpement`
.Net 10 a été distribuée en novembre 2025. La version 11 est désormais disponible en preview 1. Comme à chaque fois, de nombreuses évolutions sont attendues. L'ensemble des frameworks et des langages sont concernées : C#, F#, ASP.Net Core, Blazor, MAUI, le compilateur Jit, le support de CoreCLR dans WebAssembly, meilleure compression / décompression avec Zstandard. Sur la partie librairie, retenons déjà les évolutions suivantes :
- Zstandard est natif à .Net pour la compression. La librairie promet une nette amélioration des performances :
// Compress data using ZstandardStream
using var compressStream = new ZstandardStream(outputStream, CompressionMode.Compress);
await inputStream.CopyToAsync(compressStream); // Decompress data
using var decompressStream = new ZstandardStream(inputStream, CompressionMode.Decompress);
await decompressStream.CopyToAsync(outputStream);
- BFloat16 intègre par défaut toutes les interfaces standards pour le numérique
- amélioration de TimeZone
Note de version sur les librairies : https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/11.0/preview/preview1/libraries.md
Sur la partie runtime, il faut s'attendre à de bonnes nouvelles :
- Runtime async : une nouvelle fonction majeure du runtime et méthodes asynchrones pour améliorer les performances. CoreCLR supporte RuntimeAsync par défaut, idem pour Native AOT
- CoreCLR est supporté dans WebAssembly. Il n'est pas encore disponible en preview 1.
- diverses améliorations de performances sur le JIT - meilleur support de RISC-V
Sur C#, pour le moment, peu de nouveautés annoncées. Deux nouvelles fonctions sont attendues : arguments pour les expresssions Collection et support Extended layout. .Net 11 n'introduira aucune nouvelle fonctionnalité pour Visual Basic. Sur ASP.Net Core et Blazor, les développeurs vont avoir beaucoup de nouveautés : EnvironmentBoundary, nouveau composant Label dans les formulaires Blazor, nouveau composant DisplayName, navigation relative Uri, support "propre" des éléments MathML dans un rendu interactif. Tous les détails dans la note de version : https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/11.0/preview/preview1/aspnetcore.md
La génération de source XAML est par défaut pour les applications .Net MAUI, cela doit permettre un build plus rapide et un debug plus performant. Sur Android, CoreCLR devient le runtime par défaut. Sur Container Images et Winfows Forms, pas de nouveautés annoncées.

### 74. `FR` [LibreOffice 26.2 : Markdown, accessibilité et plein d’autres nouveautés et améliorations](data/articles/4a3f163314f7c85cbeb59ed3f13797b0.html)
**Source:** LinuxFr | **Keyword:** `France`
En février, il y a la corvée commerciale de la Saint-Valentin et les réjouissances intellectuelles consécutives à la sortie d’une nouvelle version de la suite bureautique LibreOffice. C’est, bien évidemment, sur LibreOffice 26.2 que l’on va se pencher. Au menu, du très visible, comme les boites de dialogues, du très attendu comme la prise en compte du Markdown ou du moins visible comme le travail sur l’accessibilité.
Il va de soi que les notes de version sont plus exhaustives et qu’il ne s’agit ici que d’une sélection. lien nᵒ 1 : Notes de version Sommaire
L’accessibilité
Support du Markdown
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Writer
Calc
En vrac
Pour finir
Avant de commencer : toutes les captures d’écran ont été faites, volontairement, sur une interface très personnalisée.
L’accessibilité
L’accessibilité de la suite bureautique est un important chantier pour lequel une personne a été recrutée en 2023 (en). Cette version-ci a fait l’objet d’améliorations sensibles. Parallèlement, Sophie Gautier, coordinatrice de The Document Foundation1 (Foundation coordinator) est en train de monter un groupe de travail qui a pour objectif la publication d’un rapport de conformité en matière d’accessibilité pour répondre à la norme européenne EN 301 549 (en) d’accessiblité numérique. La langue de travail de ce groupe est l’anglais.
Concernant les améliorations de cette version :
la boite de dialogue « Vérifier les mises à jour », Aide &gt; Vérifier les mises à jour… est devenue accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
les fonctions d’accessibilité des aperçus des bordures, onglet « Bordures » des boites de dialogue, ont été revues afin qu’elles ne perturbent plus les dispositifs d’assistance ;
sur Linux : la boite de dialogue Outils&gt; Orthographe est annoncée correctement par le lecteur d’écran ;
quand on supprimait la sélection accessible, le curseur se déplaçait automatiquement au début du texte, ce comportement perturbant est supprimé ;
dans Writer, les fautes d’orthographe ne sont plus signalées par les dispositifs d’assistance si la vérification orthographique n’est pas activée ;
l’accessibilité au clavier de la boite de dialogue des extensions : Outils &gt; Extensions est accessible aux lecteurs d’écran ;
et enfin, il est possible de naviguer entre les onglets verticaux avec des raccourcis clavier.
Support du Markdown
Le Markdown est devenu le format de balisage léger standard « de fait ». Et c’est celui supporté par LinuxFR. Son support a été introduit dans cette version, c’est un des formats d’enregistrement qui s’est ajouté à la série des autres formats de la suite, pas un format d’export. Pour l’utiliser pour vos sites, passant pour LinuxFR, vous devrez :
soit ouvrir le fichier .md dans un éditeur de texte, n’importe lequel, même Mousepad fait l’affaire par exemple, et copier-coller ensuite le tout à partir de l’éditeur de texte là où vous le voulez ;
soit, si cela est possible, importer le fichier .md dans ce qui vous sert pour gérer le site comme le fait par exemple l’extension ODT2SPIP pour le système de gestion de contenu SPIP qui permet de créer une nouvelle page dans SPIP avec un fichier.ODT. ça marche avec LinuxFR ? Plutôt bien. Les styles de caractère Accentuation (ici en italiques) et Accentuation forte (ici gras) sont bien reconnu ainsi que Texte source pour « télétype », les indications in-texte encadrées de l’accent grave U+0060. Les styles de paragraphes :
Bloc de citation (paragraphes de citation précédés d’une ligne blanche et du signe « &gt; » dans la saisie de contenu sur LinuxFR) ;
Contenu de tableau ;
Corps de texte ;
Liste, par contre la numérotation des listes ordonnée ne semble pas bien fonctionner, il faut saisir les numéros à la main ;
Texte préformaté pour écrire des blocs de code ;
Titre 1, Titre 2, Titre 3 et Titre de tableau.
Les tableaux sont bien repris ainsi que les liens insérés via l’insertion d’hyperliens.
Ce qui ne semble pas fonctionner du tout : ce sont les notes, elles disparaissent corps et biens. C’est peut-être dû au passage dans l’éditeur de texte qui transforme un peu le document. Et, évidemment, il faut rajouter les images avec la syntaxe LinuxFR.
La version de Mardown de LibreOffice est CommonMark (en) et la bibliothèque utilisée est MD4C avec quelques extensions prises en charge par cette bibliothèque (cf ce rapport de bug (en) et ses réponses), pour en savoir plus, voir cette note (en) du blog de The Document Foundation.
Petite remarque, si vous utilisez un LibreOffice 25.8, vous avez peut-être pu constater qu’il était question d’enregistrement au format .md, cette information a été ajoutée trop précocement car la version 25.8 ne gère pas le Markdown.
L’interface et les boites de dialogue
Les boites de dialogue, notamment de styles et de formats, ont beaucoup changé. Longtemps elles se sont affichées avec une présentation par onglets en haut et le contenu dessous.
Puis il y a une période de transition en 2025 qui a fait grincer une collection complète de dents où on avait, selon l’endroit où on était, soit des onglets soit une navigation par menu latéral. Cette dernière avait un gros défaut : par exemple pour la configuration des styles dans Writer il fallait descendre tout en bas pour accéder aux options qui étaient cachées. Et il n’y avait pas de barre de défilement pour aller plus vite.
LibreOffice 26.2 voit ces défauts corrigés : les boites de dialogue sont harmonisées dans toute la suite et leur menu latéral, toujours sans barre de défilement qui s’avère finalement inutile, montre clairement tous les types de paramètres auxquels on peut accéder. Et, comme on peut le voir, LibreOffice a intégré une meilleure prise en charge des systèmes d’écritures asiatiques et complexes en affichant deux colonnes, une pour les polices occidentales, ou pour les polices asiatiques ou complexes. Une personne a également été recrutée en 2023 (en) pour travailler sur le support des systèmes d’écriture de droite à gauche (RTL) et complexes (CTL). Si toutefois, vous préférez revenir à l’affichage avec les onglets, il suffit d’aller dans le menu Outils &gt; Options &gt; Apparenceau niveau de « Boites de dialogue » et cocher l’option Horizontal en haut. Il faut savoir que les onglets en haut ne s’affichent que sur une seule ligne et qu’il faudra donc naviguer avec les flèches quand il y a de nombreuses options. Writer
Il y a un certain nombre d’amélioration autour de la compatibilité avec le format DOCX : séparation de tableaux flottants en plusieurs tableaux, suppression de la numérotation des notes de bas de page à l’ouverture d’un fichier DOCX, etc.
On relèvera deux nouvelles options d’alignement des paragraphes : « Début » et « Fin ». Si vous utilisez l’alphabet latin, vous ne verrez aucune différence avec les deux options « Forcer à gauche/en haut » et « Forcer à droite/en bas ». Elles ont été développées pour réutiliser plus facilement les styles entre les divers systèmes d’écriture. Pour continuer sur la lancée du travail pour la prise en compte des systèmes d’écriture dont le fonctionnement est différent de celui de l’alphabet latin, il est possible de changer la direction du texte : de gauche à droite ou de droite à gauche en cours de travail. Cela peut se paramétrer dans les styles. Calc
Un gros travail sur les performances a été fait : vitesse de défilement, rapidité des classeurs avec de nombreuses formes et du rejet des modifications. On voit apparaître de nouvelles options de tri (Données &gt;Trier) qui dépendent de la « locale » (langue définie dans les Options de LibreOffice). On peut ainsi déterminer quel caractère est utilisé comme séparateur de décimal pour le tri naturel. On peut relever aussi une avancée ergonomique qui va plaire à toutes celles et ceux qui utilisent les matrices, on peut maintenant modifier les formules matricielles avec la combinaison de touches : F2 + ↑ Maj + Ctrl + Entrée, il n’est plus nécessaire de modifier la formule elle-même.
Et aussi : si vous utilisez (pourquoi diable ?) le format d’enregistrement XLSX, c’est le format EXCEL2010+ qui est le format par défaut, il change de nom pour devenir « Classeur Excel 2010-365 ».2
En vrac
Base est devenu complètement multi-utilisateur, TDF a, d’ailleurs, recruté une personne pour travailler sur l’application.
Concernant les diagrammes (ou chart) : dans le Volet latéral, quand le graphique est en mode modification et que l’on va, au niveau de « Couleurs », sur la palette, on a une prévisualisation en direct dans le diagramme ce qui permet de tester le choix de couleurs plus facilement.
Les polices embarquées dont la licence ne permettait pas l’édition étaient jusqu’à présent ignorées et remplacées à l’affichage, ni vu, ni connu par une fonte de substitution. Ce défaut a été corrigé.
L’export PDF gère les liens avec les documents externes : Fichier &gt; Exporter au format PDF &gt; Liens. Les dictionnaires hongrois, mongol et portugais du Portugal ont été mis à jour ainsi que les règles de césure de la langue hongroise.
JSON, pour JavaScript Object Notation, est un format standard utilisé pour représenter des données structurées. Il est utilisé notamment pour échanger les informations entre un navigateur et un serveur. C’est, par exemple, le format de sauvegarde des marques-pages de Firefox ou de certains fichiers d’archives de Mastodon. Les documents XML et JSON génériques avec des plages pouvant être liées sont maintenant automatiquement mappés à des feuilles dans Calc. Une plage pouvant être liée est une section d’un document contenant des enregistrements tabulaires. Lorsqu’un document contient plusieurs plages pouvant être liées, chaque plage est mappée à une seule feuille3.
Et si vous avez envie de vous amuser avec les fonctions expérimentales (à activer dansOutils &gt; Options &gt; LibreOffice &gt; Avancé), vous pouvez jouer avec la nouvelle de boite de dialogue « Gestion des macros ».
Pour finir
Cette dépêche a, bien, évidemment, été rédigée avec LibreOffice et, cette fois-ci dans un fichier enregistré en Markdown. Les seules balises que j’ai dû entrer à la main sont celles des images. Kate a l’air de modifier le fichier et, quand je réouvre le .md dans LibreOffice, il y a des styles qui ont sauté mais la mise en forme reste visuellement la même. Kate rajoute aussi des barres obliques devant les « &gt; », aux crochets [ ] et même à certains hyperliens (images). Il y a peut-être des éditeurs de texte plus adaptés ou des réglages à faire.
J’ai rédigé cette dépêche en même temps qu’un article sur LibreOffice 26.2 pour mon site. Si l’article n’est pas vraiment dupliqué, il n’est pas étonnant d’y trouver des morceaux ici. Que tout cela ne nous empêche d’adresser tous nos remerciements à celles et ceux qui font de LibreOffice une suite bureautique si agréable à utiliser et si performante.
Post-scriptum : si vous voulez savoir modifier les couleurs de l’interface comme sur les captures d’écran, ça peut s’envisager, demandez gentiment, avec un peu de chance.
The Document Foundation ou TDF est la fondation de droit allemand qui pilote le projet LibreOffice. Il y a deux formats OOXML différents et donc deux formats XLSX différents, la version 2007 et la version actuelle depuis 2010. S’il vous est vraiment nécessaire d’enregistrer au format XLSX, il faut utiliser la version de 2010. Notes de version.

**Source:** Hacker News Show | **Keyword:** `Tech`
Hi HN,
I’ve always been frustrated by this: we live in an era of exponential scientific progress, but almost no one can clearly trace a cutting-edge discovery back to the first principles it’s built on. We learn science in silos, not as a connected, logical tree.
So I built The Map of Science — an interactive dependency graph for the entirety of human scientific knowledge.
It’s simple: every scientific theory is a node, every derivation/dependency is an edge. You can trace a path from basic math axioms to quantum field theory, from early computing to modern LLMs, and see exactly how each breakthrough builds on what came before.
The stack: React + Cytoscape for the frontend, Node.js + Neo4j for the backend (a relational DB couldn’t handle the deep recursive queries for multi-layer derivation chains). It’s fully open source under MIT, and we’ve already seeded the core dataset for math, physics, and computer science.
This is a project that can never be finished by one person. I need your help:
If you’re a domain expert, help us fix incorrect links or expand into biology, chemistry, social sciences, and more.
If you’re a developer, help us optimize the graph rendering for even larger datasets.
If you just love science, tell us what works, what doesn’t, and what you want to see next.
I’d specifically love your thoughts on:
We’re using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) tree structure to show derivation dependencies. Does this make cross-field interdisciplinary links clear enough? Is there a better way to visualize these relationships?
What’s the cleanest way to represent superseded or disputed theories (like Newtonian vs. relativistic mechanics, or phlogiston theory vs. oxidation)? We want to honor their historical importance without cluttering the core, up-to-date knowledge chain.

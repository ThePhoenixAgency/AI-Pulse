**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
There's a native YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro that's great for user-uploaded VR180 and 3D 360 content, but 2D video is better watched in Safari or third-party apps.


YouTube has a native app on Apple Vision Pro
When Apple Vision Pro launched in February 2024, there was a host of popular apps missing from it, including YouTube. While many apps still aren't on the platform or native, including Apple's, Google has finally brought its app to the platform.
The app itself is straightforward and functions identically to the YouTube app on iPad.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
The patent troll Optis has been told by a US jury that Apple has not infringed on any of its LTE patents, ending the elongated dispute in the US until yet another appeal is made.


Optis hoped to collect money for every iPhone sold
The latest jury trial occurred after the US Court of Appeals threw out a verdict that would have had Apple paying Optis $300 million in damages. The case was then sent to a trial by jury where the jury members would be asked a single question about the five patents.
According to a report from Reuters, the jury voted unanimously. The question was:

The newly launched Aqara U400 is the first — and so far only — smart lock with Ultra Wideband Home Key support, and after using it for the past month, I don't think I can go back.


Aqara U400 review: The first UWB smart lock
I firmly believe that smart locks are one of the best smart home devices you can add to your home. Not only do they offer unparalleled convenience of unlocking or locking your home from anywhere, but they also add peace of mind.
If I get in the car to leave my house, I don't have to fret about whether the door was locked.

A story suggesting Apple was having internal struggles and may delay anticipated new Siri features has been mildly countered with a statement from Apple — "on track to launch in 2026."

**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
Apple did not infringe on any patents owned by Texas-based company Optis Wireless, a jury ruled today. In a verdict shared by Reuters, the jury decided that Apple did not infringe any of the five LTE patents that Optis sued over back in 2019. If Optis had won, Apple could have faced hundreds of millions in damages.


Optis Wireless initially won $506 million from Apple in a 2020 jury trial, but the damages were thrown out after Apple appealed because the jury didn't calculate damages with an understanding of fair and reasonable essential patent (FRAND) terms.

Apple is still planning to launch the smarter, more capable version of Siri in 2026, the company told CNBC today. Apple's statement comes just a day after Bloomberg reported Apple is having issues with the updated version of ‌Siri‌, leading to potential delays of the feature.


Apple initially intended to launch the Apple Intelligence-powered version of ‌Siri‌ in spring 2025, but right around when a debut was expected in March 2025, Apple said that Siri wasn't ready and needed more time. Later in the year, Apple said that it would launch its Siri update in 2026.

Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman yesterday reported that Apple’s new Siri initiative was facing internal delays, having originally been planned to start rolling out with iOS 26.4. Gurman suggested features may start appearing in iOS 26.5, or later releases in the year.
That report has seemingly rocked investor confidence, with Apple stock plummeting today. Seemingly in response, CNBC’s Steve Kovach says Apple confirmed to him that it remains on track to launch new Siri this year, which is essentially reaffirming what it has promised publicly all along.

The iPhone was one of the first phones to gain satellite connectivity back with the launch of the iPhone 14 in 2022, but this feature was intended mainly as an emergency measure. Break a leg or run out of water when hiking in the wilderness, and emergency SOS could save your life, but it wasn’t much help for browsing social media.

The original post claims Apple Music "fired" Jay-Z after years of producing the halftime show.

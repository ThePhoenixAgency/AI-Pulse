These two teams already met in the 2015 Super Bowl, which ended in a Patriots championship.

The future of Apple Fitness+ remains "under review," according to the latest word from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. However, he did not share any specific details.


"If I were to guess, Apple will ultimately meld its Health app with Fitness+ in some fashion — perhaps offering it as a combined subscription," said Gurman.

scaled back plans for a separate Apple Health+ subscription service, which would have provided AI-powered health recommendations. However, he said some of the features that would have been part of Apple Health+ will be repurposed and rolled out individually.

In a recent all-hands meeting, Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees to "stay tuned" about the company's plans for its upcoming 50th anniversary. Apple was founded on April 1, 1976, so the company will turn 50 in a few more months.


Following a snippet last week, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has since shared Cook's full remarks:
I've been unusually reflective lately about Apple because we have been working on what do we do to mark this moment — 50 years. It's an extraordinary accomplishment. We've been going back through old archives, old photographs.

The iPhone 17e will be hitting store shelves soon, with the update to the iPhone 16e packing the same A19 chip as the iPhone 17.


The iPhone 17e should look like the iPhone 16e.
Apple is expected to bring out an update to the iPhone 16e in early 2026, replacing it with a new iPhone 17e model. That update could arrive very soon, if one report is correct.
According to Bloomberg's "Power On: newsletter on Sunday, Mark Gurman writes that the launch is due "imminently." Gurman doesn't specify a specific date, but it could arrive within days or a few weeks.

Apple is rumored to be launching a product the week of March 2, with the most likely candidate being MacBook Pro models equipped with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips.


The M5 MacBook Pro could finally get some stablemates in March
Apple often holds events in March as one of its earliest of the year. According to one report, that could be just the case in 2026.
Writing in Sunday's "Power On" newsletter for Bloomberg, Mark Gurman writes that Apple is planning a product launch that is currently scheduled for as "early as the week of March 2."

Lately, I’ve been leaning more and more into a sling-based EDC. As a techy husband and father of two, I constantly find myself needing more space than my pockets can hold, but not always wanting to bring an entire backpack. A cross-body sling (or fanny pack, as it was once called) has become the perfect middle ground. It forces you to be intentional about what you carry, while still giving you more flexibility than a standard pocket setup.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
New MacBook Pro models with the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips could arrive as soon as Monday, March 2, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.


In today's "Power On" newsletter, Gurman said that the release of new ‌MacBook Pro‌ models is tied to the release of macOS Tahoe 26.3. The launch is said to be slated for as early as the week of March 2. He added that the M4 Pro and M4 Max models on sale today remain in short supply, indicating that the launch of new models is close. 

Mac Studio models "shouldn't arrive too long after the spring Mac refresh," according to Gurman.

### 14. [M5 Max Mac Studio &amp; New Studio Display could finally arrive in the spring](https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/08/m5-max-mac-studio-new-studio-display-could-finally-arrive-in-the-spring?utm_source=rss)
**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
Apple's Mac desktop lineup should get M5 variants and the Studio Display may finally get its long-awaited upgrade just after M5 Pro and Max MacBook Pros arrive. Here's what to expect, and when.


Mac Studio and Studio Display could be updated soon
Apple Silicon has been on a fairly predictable near-annual update cycle, which means the Mac lineup gets updated at a similar cadence. While some chips are short-cycled, others take just a bit longer, which seems to be the case for the Mac Studio in 2026.

### 15. [Report Reveals iOS 26.4 Beta Release Date](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/ios-26-4-beta-release-date-revealed/)

Apple is set to release the first beta version of iOS 26.4 later this month, providing the first real-world look at the Apple Intelligence features promised at WWDC 2024, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman claims.


Gurman revealed the timing in his "Power On" newsletter. Barring further delays, the first beta version of iOS 26.4 is apparently set to release to developers during the week of February 23. The update will "include some components" of the long-anticipated improvements to Siri.

### 16. [Cheaper MacBook with iPhone chip still expected in early 2026](https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/08/cheaper-macbook-with-iphone-chip-still-expected-in-early-2026?utm_source=rss)
**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
The often-rumored budget MacBook is still expected to arrive at some point in the first half of 2026, as Apple prepares to compete directly with Chromebooks.


The MacBook should be cheaper than the MacBook Air at launch
Rumors have repeatedly insisted that Apple will bring out a MacBook with an iPhone chip running the show instead of an M-series chip. As more forecasts come in, it seems the rumor mill is more insistent than ever that it will launch this year.

### 17. [iPad 12 and iPad Air 8 Reportedly Coming Soon](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/ipad-12-and-ipad-air-8-reportedly-coming-soon/)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
Apple is planning to launch new iPad and iPad Air models in the near future, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports.


Writing in today's "Power On" newsletter, Gurman explained that updated iPads are "coming soon," including a new entry-level ‌iPad‌ and a new ‌iPad Air‌. Both devices are not expected to feature design changes or major enhancements, instead focusing on new chips. The 12th-generation ‌iPad‌ is set to feature the A18 chip, while the eighth-generation ‌iPad Air‌ will apparently feature the M4 chip.

**Source:** 9to5Mac | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `iOS`
There’s been loads of speculation as to when the next generation MacBook Pros with high-end Apple Silicon would launch. Many thought January, then January came and went. All we knew is that they’d launch alongside macOS 26.3 – which should go out to the public in the coming days.
However, that only means that the MacBook Pros have to launch sometime before macOS 26.4 launches to the public. Despite the imminent launch of macOS 26.3, the MacBook Pro launch isn’t quite as imminent, per Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.

Apple's iPhone 17e is set to launch "imminently" with at least four new features, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.


In the latest edition of his "Power On" newsletter, Gurman said that the new lost-cost ‌iPhone‌ will feature the A19 chip first introduced with the iPhone 17 last year. The device will also address one of the most glaring omissions from the current generation and add MagSafe connectivity. The device is also apparently set to feature Apple's latest cellular modem, the C1X chip, as well as its N1 chip for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Thread connectivity.

TL;DR: Sony’s flagship noise-canceling headphones deliver elite sound, crystal-clear calls, and all-day comfort—now just $299.99 (MSRP $449.99).
When it comes to audio, not all headphones are created equal—and trusting your music to just any pair is a gamble. The Sony WH-1000XM6 is what happens when sound is taken seriously. These headphones were co-created with world-class mastering engineers, and it shows the second you press play.

While iPhone Fold is certainly the more interesting iPhone launching this fall, the iPhone 18 Pro will always be important for one reason: cameras. iPhone Fold won’t be able to pack a flagship camera experience, so if that’s something you’re after, you’ll have to settle for the “boring” iPhone 18 Pro.

If you’re looking to kick off the new year with a new MacBook, now’s a fantastic time to buy. In recent years, Macs have become more and more affordable – largely in part because of Apple’s transition to Apple Silicon. These MacBooks are also more capable than ever.
Apple’s latest macOS Tahoe update also dropped support for practically all Intel Macs (with some small exceptions). If you’d like to stay on the latest and greatest Apple software, nows a fitting time to upgrade.

The iPhone 18 Pro's camera system will be more flexible for photographers, with claims of a variable aperture main camera and a larger-aperture telephoto camera undergoing testing and expected to arrive later in 2026.


iPhone 17 Pro has a new wider camera plateau, which could feasibly contain a variable aperture mechanism.
The camera is one of the key marketable elements of the iPhone, and the rumor mill frequently tries to guess about the next changes to arrive. If current rumors are to be believed, that should include variable apertures.

Apple is actively testing two major rear camera improvements for the iPhone, according to a reputable leaker.


The Weibo user known as "Digital Chat Station" claims that Apple is testing a new main camera for the ‌iPhone‌ with a variable aperture. A variable aperture allows the camera to adjust the amount of light that reaches the sensor. This means that in dark environments, the aperture can be opened to receive more light, while in light environments, it can be closed to prevent over-exposure.

**Source:** Towards Data Science | **Tags:** `AI` `Data Science` `Analytics`
Kernel SVM often feels abstract, with kernels, dual formulations, and support vectors. In this article, we take a different path. Starting from Kernel Density Estimation, we build Kernel SVM step by step as a sum of local bells, weighted and selected by hinge loss, until only the essential data poin

**Source:** Towards Data Science | **Tags:** `AI` `Data Science` `Analytics`
Softmax Regression is simply Logistic Regression extended to multiple classes.
By computing one linear score per class and normalizing them with Softmax, we obtain multiclass probabilities without changing the core logic.
The loss, the gradients, and the optimization remain the same.

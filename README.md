### 1. [iPhone 18 Pro 5G via satellite rumor gets new support](https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/11/iphone-18-pro-5g-via-satellite-rumor-gets-new-support/)
**Source:** 9to5Mac | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `iOS`
Apple is believed to be on a gradual journey that began with Emergency SOS via Satellite on the iPhone 14 back in 2022 and will at some point progress to full 5G access via satellite, bypassing ground-based antenna altogether.
It’s previously been suggested that the iPhone 18 Pro might take a significant step in this direction with support for 5G over satellite links. A new report today adds weight to that idea …

For years, the Apple Pencil 2 was the go-to stylus for digital illustrators, offering easy pairing, precise input, pressure sensitivity, shading support, and much more. Then things changed. The iPad maker outdid itself with the $129 Apple Pencil Pro, which builds upon the 2nd-gen model’s solid base and takes the experience to the next level.
Despite its name, the Apple Pencil Pro’s compatibility actually extends to some non-Pro iPad models, including the latest Air and mini variants.

Pros
Charges iPhone, Watch, AirPods
Super compact
Super lightweight
Super affordable
Cons
Slow 7.5W iPhone charging
Our Verdict 
It’s certainly not the fastest 3-in-1 wireless charger, but the Mous 3-In-1 Wireless Portable Charger is without doubt the smallest and lightest we’ve tested. If you’re using it to charge your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods over night or at your leisure during the day, this is an excellent super-light, compact portable charger for your travels.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
The MacBook Air is Apple's most popular laptop – a thin, fanless machine that wields quiet power thanks to the efficiency of Apple silicon. While the M4 model isn't exactly old, attention is already turning to its successor.


Apple doesn't telegraph new product launches ahead of time, but we can draw a surprisingly clear picture of what to expect by looking at Apple's silicon roadmap, release cycles, and past upgrades.

You’ve heard this before: as a Mac user, it’s important to keep your apps up to date. Doing so not only ensures you get all the latest features as they arrive, but it also keeps your computer safe and vulnerabilities patched.
Why, then, is it so hard to keep your apps updated? Sure, the App Store lets you upgrade multiple apps at once, but many Mac users download apps from all sorts of third-party websites, not just from Apple’s storefront.

Apple's next-generation C2 modem will bring support for 5G satellite connectivity to this year's iPhone 18 Pro models, based on claims made by a Chinese leaker.


In a post on Weibo, the account "Fixed Focus Digital" said that Apple's C2 baseband modem – expected to debut in iPhone 18 Pro models – will support NR-NTN, or New Radio Non-Terrestrial Networks. 

The NR-NTN standard can relate to direct phone-to-satellite links as well as the use of satellites as backhaul for carrier networks to extend coverage into remote areas.

Phone batteries are prone to run dry just when you’re heading away from a power source, so having a portable charging source is one of today’s necessities. Annoyingly, most power banks require you to carry around a cable, too.

Apple power users on macOS Tahoe are deliberately undoing parts of Apple's latest interface overhaul in order to remove the Liquid Glass design.

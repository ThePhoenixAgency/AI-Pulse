In 2022, Apple introduced a new Apple Home architecture that is "more reliable and efficient," and support for the old architecture has now ended.


As expected, the app is no longer working for some users.

Users who did not update the app by the February 10 deadline now see this message: "You're running an older version of Apple Home that is no longer supported. Update now to continue using the Home app with your Apple devices and other accessories."

Expert's Rating



Pros
Compact 3-in-1 charger
25W iPhone charging
Apple Watch fast charger
Charge as stand or flat
Cheaper than X40 Turbo
Cons
Small but bigger than X40 Turbo
Our Verdict 
This more affordable variant of the metal X40 Turbo is rated at the same super-fast charging speeds for iPhone, AirPods and Watch. While maybe not as pocketable it’s just as portable, and the choice between the two Kuxiu chargers may just come down to color choice.

Amazon apparently thought the world would respond with a collective “awww” when it announced an expansion of its Ring Search Party feature to help find lost dogs, promoted via a 30-second Super Bowl ad (below). Instead, it’s being widely panned as a dystopian move in the current climate.

Nearly one in four active smartphones worldwide are now iPhones, according to new data from Counterpoint Research.


The findings from Counterpoint's Smartphone Installed Base Tracker show that the global installed base of active smartphones grew 2% in 2025, driven primarily by lengthening replacement cycles and the continued circulation of second-life devices. Unlike shipment figures, which measure yearly sales, installed base data reflects the total number of devices currently in use, making it a key indicator of long-term platform choices.

When it comes to smartphone launches, the principle of “no news is good news” rarely applies: a new phone that’s largely the same as its predecessor can only be a disappointment. But one exception, particularly at times of economic turmoil, is the price tag.
Last fall’s iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max were premium phones, priced accordingly: the 17 Pro starts at $1,099 and the 17 Pro Max at $1,199.

Last November, Google announced a cross-platform feature that allows Google Pixel 10 and Apple device users to share files directly via QuickShare-AirDrop interoperability. Now, Google has confirmed that the feature is set to expand to Android phones more generally this year.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
Despite owning FileMaker, Apple has never included a database app with iWork. Apple has now acquired Kuzu, Inc, a firm developing fast, flexible graph databases.

Apple has had the FileMaker database since the 1980s, but by being operated by an Apple subsidiary, it's always been kept at arms' length from the consumer iWork apps of Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. In comparison, Microsoft's Office includes the company's Access database.

Apple is believed to be on a gradual journey that began with Emergency SOS via Satellite on the iPhone 14 back in 2022 and will at some point progress to full 5G access via satellite, bypassing ground-based antenna altogether.

For years, the Apple Pencil 2 was the go-to stylus for digital illustrators, offering easy pairing, precise input, pressure sensitivity, shading support, and much more. Then things changed. The iPad maker outdid itself with the $129 Apple Pencil Pro, which builds upon the 2nd-gen model’s solid base and takes the experience to the next level.
Despite its name, the Apple Pencil Pro’s compatibility actually extends to some non-Pro iPad models, including the latest Air and mini variants.

Pros

Super compact
Super lightweight

Cons
Slow 7.5W iPhone charging
Our Verdict 
It’s certainly not the fastest 3-in-1 wireless charger, but the Mous 3-In-1 Wireless Portable Charger is without doubt the smallest and lightest we’ve tested. If you’re using it to charge your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods over night or at your leisure during the day, this is an excellent super-light, compact portable charger for your travels.

The MacBook Air is Apple's most popular laptop – a thin, fanless machine that wields quiet power thanks to the efficiency of Apple silicon. While the M4 model isn't exactly old, attention is already turning to its successor.


Apple doesn't telegraph new product launches ahead of time, but we can draw a surprisingly clear picture of what to expect by looking at Apple's silicon roadmap, release cycles, and past upgrades.

You’ve heard this before: as a Mac user, it’s important to keep your apps up to date. Doing so not only ensures you get all the latest features as they arrive, but it also keeps your computer safe and vulnerabilities patched.
Why, then, is it so hard to keep your apps updated? Sure, the App Store lets you upgrade multiple apps at once, but many Mac users download apps from all sorts of third-party websites, not just from Apple’s storefront.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
Apple's next-generation C2 modem will bring support for 5G satellite connectivity to this year's iPhone 18 Pro models, based on claims made by a Chinese leaker.


In a post on Weibo, the account "Fixed Focus Digital" said that Apple's C2 baseband modem – expected to debut in iPhone 18 Pro models – will support NR-NTN, or New Radio Non-Terrestrial Networks. 

The NR-NTN standard can relate to direct phone-to-satellite links as well as the use of satellites as backhaul for carrier networks to extend coverage into remote areas.

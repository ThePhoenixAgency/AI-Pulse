**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
Amazon this week is taking $30 off the Apple Watch SE 3, starting at $219.00 for the 40mm GPS model. These are second-best prices on the SE 3, but it's been over a month since we last tracked record low prices, so this is a good opportunity for anyone who's been waiting for a deal.

$249.00, down from $279.00. Both the 40mm and 44mm GPS models are available in Midnight and Starlight Aluminum at these prices.

It is common knowledge that communicating over WiFi is more efficient than using the 5G cellular network, but by how much exactly? That’s exactly what PhoneBuff set out to measure in its latest battery life benchmark test. 
Using an iPhone 17 Pro Max, the test simulated general phone usage including texting, web browsing, streaming video, Instagram and FaceTime. Once on 5G, once on WiFi. The final timings are perhaps closer than you’d think.

Apple’s been making an awful lot of money lately, and it’s no secret that the iPhone 17 Pro was a key part of that success. (The less said about the iPhone Air, the better.) But only now are we starting to understand why that handset sold so well, at least in one crucial market.
According to the Financial Times, Apple’s record-breaking recent sales in China are in large part due to what might seem like a small and cosmetic change. It’s all to do with the Cosmic Orange finish.

One of the more persistent and long-standing Apple rumors has been the launch of new AirPods models with built-in cameras. Another leaker added their support for this idea just yesterday.
Exactly what role these cameras would perform has been the subject of much speculation, with some suggesting they will be used to support Apple Intelligence visual features. While that is certainly possible, I can’t help wondering whether the reports point to support for hand gestures similar to those used with Vision Pro …

**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
In 2022, Apple introduced a new Apple Home architecture that is "more reliable and efficient," and the deadline to upgrade and avoid issues is today.


In an email last week, Apple gave customers a final reminder to upgrade their Home app by February 10, 2026. Apple says users who do not upgrade may experience issues with accessories and automations, or lose access to their smart home in the app entirely. In addition, users who do not upgrade will miss out on newer features like robot vacuum cleaner support, and they will not receive important security fixes and performance improvements.

Apple's resurgence in China after a three-year slump was supposedly helped by a color, with the iPhone 17 Pro's bright orange option compared to the hue of luxury brand Hermes.


Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro Max
During Apple's blockbuster Q1 2026 results, revenue from China reversed a three-year slump in sales, increasing 38% year over year. If analysts are to be believed, it may have had something to do with Apple's color selection.
Prominently featured in marketing, the Cosmic Orange colorway for the iPhone 17 Pro line certainly catches the eye.

Reports of Liquid Glass’s death were, it seems, greatly exaggerated. According to a new report, Apple has no plans to move on from the divisive software design for at least another year.
In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman discusses Apple’s plans for iOS 27 this year, and concludes that, other than a new chatbot version of Siri, it will focus on fixes rather than features. And later in the newsletter he clarifies that this means we shouldn’t expect a new look.

Apple and Google have agreed to a series of changes aimed at making their app stores fairer for developers, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced today.


The concrete commitments come after the CMA found the two companies had a duopoly and designated them as having "strategic market status" in mobile platforms last October. The designation is not a finding of wrongdoing, but gives UK regulators new powers to demand specific changes to boost competition in the mobile market.

One of the reasons why we’re Apple users is the iconic designs the company uses. For example, the current MacBook lineup has a beautiful design with a distinguished look that’s instantly recognizable and often imitated. Apple has a long history of iconic design, many of which are just beloved today as they were decades ago.
Case maker Spigen is looking towards those past designs for inspiration. In an X post on Monday, the company posted a concept image of a MacBook case that takes its cues from the classic Macintosh from 1984.

OpenAI's first Jony Ive-designed hardware device won't ship to customers until next year, new court filings show (via Wired).


The motion stems from a trademark infringement lawsuit filed last year by audio device startup iyO. The company sued OpenAI after the latter acquired io, a startup founded by Apple's former design chief.

OpenAI's original stated goal was to ship the ChatGPT-powered device before the end of 2026. But in the latest filing, the company said its first hardware device won't ship to customers before the end of February 2027.

Apple's iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max have been runaway hits in China, but it has nothing to do with new AI or camera features – it's largely down to the color.


The Cosmic Orange finish made available exclusively on Apple's high-end Pro models has been widely dubbed "Hermès orange" by Chinese consumers who associate the vivid hue with the French luxury brand's signature color. 

Financial Times reports that videos showcasing the orange iPhones have gone viral on Chinese social media since the devices launched in September.

TL;DR: This lifetime Microsoft Office 2024 license works for Mac or PC, and it’s on sale for $99.97 for a limited time.
The main reason many people stick with Microsoft 365 is access to newer features, especially AI tools — but that advantage is gone. Microsoft Office 2024 Home and Business delivers the latest versions of Microsoft’s apps with modern AI integrations, without locking you into a subscription. Instead of paying at least $99.99 every year, you can pay $99.97 once for lifetime access (MSRP $249.99).

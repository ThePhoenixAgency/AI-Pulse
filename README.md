**Source:** AI News | **Tags:** `AI` `News` `Industry`
AI cost efficiency and data sovereignty are at odds, forcing a rethink of enterprise risk frameworks for global organisations. For over a year, the generative AI narrative focused on a race for capability, often measuring success by parameter counts and flawed benchmark scores. Boardroom conversations, however, are undergoing a necessary correction. While the allure of […]

**Source:** VentureBeat AI | **Tags:** `AI` `Enterprise` `Business`
The artificial intelligence coding revolution comes with a catch: it's expensive.
Claude Code, Anthropic's terminal-based AI agent that can write, debug, and deploy code autonomously, has captured the imagination of software developers worldwide. But its pricing — ranging from $20 to $200 per month depending on usage — has sparked a growing rebellion among the very programmers it aims to serve.
Now, a free alternative is gaining traction.

## Mac & Apple

### 1. [Variable aperture camera will give iPhone 18 Pro users more photo options](https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/02/07/variable-aperture-camera-will-give-iphone-18-pro-users-more-photo-options?utm_source=rss)
**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
The iPhone 18 Pro's camera system will be more flexible for photographers, with claims of a variable aperture main camera and a larger-aperture telephoto camera undergoing testing and expected to arrive later in 2026.


iPhone 17 Pro has a new wider camera plateau, which could feasibly contain a variable aperture mechanism.
The camera is one of the key marketable elements of the iPhone, and the rumor mill frequently tries to guess about the next changes to arrive. If current rumors are to be believed, that should include variable apertures.

### 2. [Apple Testing Two Major iPhone 18 Pro Camera Upgrades](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/07/two-major-iphone-18-pro-camera-upgrades/)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
Apple is actively testing two major rear camera improvements for the iPhone, according to a reputable leaker.


The Weibo user known as "Digital Chat Station" claims that Apple is testing a new main camera for the ‌iPhone‌ with a variable aperture. A variable aperture allows the camera to adjust the amount of light that reaches the sensor. This means that in dark environments, the aperture can be opened to receive more light, while in light environments, it can be closed to prevent over-exposure.

**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
Apple today shared an ad that shows how the upgraded Center Stage front camera on the latest iPhones improves the process of taking a group selfie.



"Watch how the new front facing camera on iPhone 17 Pro takes group selfies that automatically expand and rotate as more people come into frame," says Apple. While the ad is focused on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, the regular iPhone 17 and the iPhone Air have the same Center Stage front camera with this functionality.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
Safari now works a lot like other major browsers when it comes to displaying web content on an iPhone or Mac, after a year-long joint effort to make the online experience similar across the industry.


Safari is Apple's web browser found in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS
As people who grew up with Internet Explorer and Netscape can attest, there can be a lot of difference between what one browser displays and what another shows. Thanks to an effort between multiple browser makers, including Apple, the web navigation tools now work a lot more predictably.

**Source:** 9to5Mac | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `iOS`
Last year, Apple confirmed that it’d be supporting end-to-end encryption with RCS in a future software update. At the time, iOS 18 was still the latest version of iOS – thus implying that the upgrade would come as part of the next round of software – iOS 26.
So far, end-to-end encryption is yet to ship. That’s not the only thing though. The upgrade to end-to-end encryption would’ve also necessitated other major upgrades to the RCS protocol, and as of iOS 26.3 RC, it’s all still missing.

TL;DR: A tiny but powerful 4G Android smartphone that fits anywhere, works everywhere, and costs way less than you’d expect.
Smartphones keep getting bigger, heavier, and harder to ignore—until now. The NanoPhone Pro flips the script by packing full smartphone functionality into a device that’s about the size of a credit card. Yes, it’s real. And yes, it actually works (and it’s on sale).

TL;DR: Grab a 10TB lifetime cloud storage plan at $269.97 before the price goes back up after tomorrow, February 8 (MSRP $2,900).
Most cloud storage plans quietly charge you over and over again for the same space. This one flips that model on its head, offering enough storage for years of photos, projects, and backups with a one-time commitment that’s only available for a little longer.
The 10TB plan is perfect for most users who never want to run out of space, and it’s 90% off right now.

CarPlay could soon support more than just Siri, as Apple explores wider access for third-party voice tools.


Apple may open CarPlay to third-party AI assistants
It looks as though Apple is gearing up to allow third-party chatbots on CarPlay. This would allow users to query voice-enabled chatbots directly through the CarPlay interface.
Until now, Apple has kept voice assistants off CarPlay, save for its first-party assistant, Siri. However, with the slow rollout of the new, more personal Siri, Apple may feel the pressure to give its users options.

Apple is planning to bring new AI features to CarPlay, reports Bloomberg. Apple will allow third-party chatbot apps to integrate with ‌CarPlay‌, so AI services like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT will be accessible in the car for the first time.


‌CarPlay‌ already supports third-party apps, but the types of apps that are supported are limited. Companies like Anthropic and OpenAI aren't currently able to create ‌CarPlay‌ apps, so users are limited to using Siri voice controls in the vehicle.

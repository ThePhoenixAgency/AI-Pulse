TL;DR: A tiny but powerful 4G Android smartphone that fits anywhere, works everywhere, and costs way less than you’d expect.
Smartphones keep getting bigger, heavier, and harder to ignore—until now. The NanoPhone Pro flips the script by packing full smartphone functionality into a device that’s about the size of a credit card. Yes, it’s real. And yes, it actually works (and it’s on sale).
Despite its ultra-small footprint, NanoPhone Pro covers the essentials:

TL;DR: Grab a 10TB lifetime cloud storage plan at $269.97 before the price goes back up after tomorrow, February 8 (MSRP $2,900).
Most cloud storage plans quietly charge you over and over again for the same space. This one flips that model on its head, offering enough storage for years of photos, projects, and backups with a one-time commitment that’s only available for a little longer.
The 10TB plan is perfect for most users who never want to run out of space, and it’s 90% off right now.

On March 6, NASA is scheduled to launch the Artemis II mission to the moon. And for the first time, it is allowing its crew members to take its smartphones with them, according to a recent announcement by NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman.

It's been four months since the iPhone Air came out, and it hasn't exactly been a resounding success. Sales are reportedly so low that Apple is delaying the next-generation model.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
CarPlay could soon support more than just Siri, as Apple explores wider access for third-party voice tools.


Apple may open CarPlay to third-party AI assistants
It looks as though Apple is gearing up to allow third-party chatbots on CarPlay. This would allow users to query voice-enabled chatbots directly through the CarPlay interface.
Until now, Apple has kept voice assistants off CarPlay, save for its first-party assistant, Siri. However, with the slow rollout of the new, more personal Siri, Apple may feel the pressure to give its users options.

A new report from Bloomberg says that the long-in-development subscription health service is on the rocks. The centerpiece of the service, which some have been calling “Health+” was to be an AI wellness and fitness coach, code-named Mulberry.

Apple is planning to bring new AI features to CarPlay, reports Bloomberg. Apple will allow third-party chatbot apps to integrate with ‌CarPlay‌, so AI services like Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT will be accessible in the car for the first time.


‌CarPlay‌ already supports third-party apps, but the types of apps that are supported are limited. Companies like Anthropic and OpenAI aren't currently able to create ‌CarPlay‌ apps, so users are limited to using Siri voice controls in the vehicle.

If you want to protect your privacy and security online, using a VPN on your Mac is one of the easiest and most effective steps you can take.
While macOS includes built-in security features, a VPN adds an extra layer of protection by encrypting your internet traffic and hiding your IP address. This helps prevent tracking, protects your data on public Wi-Fi, and can make it appear as though you’re browsing from another country. Many people also use VPNs to access region-restricted streaming services or bypass location-based website limitations.

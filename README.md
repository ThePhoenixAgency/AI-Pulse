The iPhone 17e, one of Apple’s most highly anticipated products for 2026, could arrive in less than a week. But the announcement is unlikely to hold many surprises, because the leaks are now coming thick and fast.
Take the tech specs. We’re reasonably confident that the 17e will feature most or all of the following: an A19 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of starting storage (up from 128GB), a C1X modem, the same single 48MP rear-facing camera as on the 16e (although the selfie camera could get an upgrade), a 60Hz 6.1-inch screen, support for MagSafe, and a starting price of $599.

Apple has released multiple macOS versions over the years, each bringing new features, design changes, and hardware requirements. Whether you’re trying to identify the version on your Mac, decide if it’s time to upgrade, or understand which releases are still supported, this guide covers every macOS version from the original Mac OS X Cheetah to the latest macOS 26 Tahoe. Below, you’ll find a complete list of macOS versions in order, along with release dates, codenames, key details and support information.

For the past decade, my Apple Time Capsule has faithfully backed up my Mac. I’ve been through several upgrades over the past decade—my current machine is an M3 Max MacBook Pro—and I’ve never had an issue with my Time Capsule. It’s been one of the most reliable devices I’ve ever owned, and I’ve barely had to even think about it since I bought it in 2016.
Until recently, that is. I don’t know the exact date, but I installed macOS Tahoe 26.2 sometime near the end of 2025.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
There's a native YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro that's great for user-uploaded VR180 and 3D 360 content, but 2D video is better watched in Safari or third-party apps.


YouTube has a native app on Apple Vision Pro
When Apple Vision Pro launched in February 2024, there was a host of popular apps missing from it, including YouTube. While many apps still aren't on the platform or native, including Apple's, Google has finally brought its app to the platform.
The app itself is straightforward and functions identically to the YouTube app on iPad.

The newly launched Aqara U400 is the first — and so far only — smart lock with Ultra Wideband Home Key support, and after using it for the past month, I don't think I can go back.


Aqara U400 review: The first UWB smart lock
I firmly believe that smart locks are one of the best smart home devices you can add to your home. Not only do they offer unparalleled convenience of unlocking or locking your home from anywhere, but they also add peace of mind.

Meta plans to add a facial recognition feature to its Ray-Ban smart glasses as soon as this year, reports The New York Times ($). 


According to people involved in the plans who spoke to the publication, the feature is internally called "Name Tag," and would let wearers identify people and get information about them via Meta's artificial intelligence assistant. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly wants the feature to differentiate the devices and to make the AI assistant in the glasses more useful.

Jon Prosser is currently being sued by Apple over his leaks, but continues to publish videos with claims of what is coming next for the iPhone.

Well it only took two years, but there’s finally an official YouTube app for Vision Pro. You could always just visit YouTube using the Vision Pro web browser, but that’s not the same thing. And the popular third-party app, Juno, was quickly taken down.
The official YouTube app is not quite an MVP (minimum viable product), but it’s close. It’s just a floating window that can play YouTube videos, including the relatively paltry selection of 3D 360-degree and VR 180-degree videos.

Coding is one of the skills I’ve been eyeing on and off for a few years now. When Apple first launched the Swift Playgrounds app on the iPad, I instantly fell in love with the concept and enrolled in multiple online courses to learn iOS app development. While I quickly absorbed the basics of coding in Swift, mastering the skill to ship functional iPhone apps turned out to be a real challenge. That changed when Apple released its latest Xcode update.
Xcode version 26.3 introduces native support for AI coding agents, such as OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Agent.

## Mac & Apple

### 1. [Live Activities Taking Over Your Apple Watch? Here's the Fix](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-watch-live-activities-fix/)
**Source:** MacRumors | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `News`
In watchOS 26, the Smart Stack for your Apple Watch is pretty clever. The collection of widgets can be pulled up with a scroll of the Digital Crown, and shows you relevant information throughout your day. But sometimes, its eagerness to help can be a bit much, especially when it comes to Live Activities.


You're probably familiar with this scenario: You raise your wrist expecting to see your customized watch face, but it's been replaced by media playback controls because someone's watching your Apple TV, or a timer you set earlier for cooking that still has ages left to run.

### 2. [More Siri delays, imminent new hardware, and Apple’s upcoming 50th birthday ](https://9to5mac.com/2026/02/12/happy-hour-577/)

Benjamin and Chance react to the disappointing news shared by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman that the new Siri features are facing even more delays, but in happier news, a bunch of iPhones, iPads and Macs are due for an imminent refresh. Meanwhile, Tim Cook reminisces ahead of Apple’s 50th birthday.  
And in Happy Hour Plus, thoughts on the design of the Ferrari Luce and Jony Ive’s sniping comments about his former employer.

The iPhone was one of the first phones to gain satellite connectivity back with the launch of the iPhone 14 in 2022, but this feature was intended mainly as an emergency measure. Break a leg or run out of water when hiking in the wilderness, and emergency SOS could save your life, but it wasn’t much help for browsing social media. But a more accessible general-purpose satellite feature could be coming to the iPhone as soon as this year.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
Rumors that Jay-Z lost his Apple Music leadership position in connection with the Super Bowl halftime show are lies, and trace back to a satirical post falsely presented as news.


Hip hop star Jay-Z
The rumor traces back to a post from "America's Last Line of Defense," a network known for publishing fabricated stories presented as satire. Screenshots of the post circulated on Facebook and other platforms without the page's disclaimer, giving the false impression it was a legitimate report.
The original post claims Apple Music "fired" Jay-Z after years of producing the halftime show.

We get it, $90 is a lot of money for a power strip, but there’s a reason for that. First of all, this thing’s remarkably space-efficient, with a low-profile design that’s about the size of a smartphone.

A YouTube app is finally available for the Apple Vision Pro, years after Google confirmed that it was "on the roadmap."

Until now, Apple Vision Pro owners have been reduced to watching YouTube via the Safari web browser or using a third-party app. Now, they can download the free, official YouTube app from the headset's App Store.
Google seemed intent on ensuring that its website would be the only way to watch YouTube initially. The company had Juno, a third-party YouTube player, kicked off the App Store in late 2024.

Expert's Rating



Pros
Power bank in a protective phone case
Robust two-part design
Slimmer than previous models
Magnetic back
Cons
Battery capacity not as high as a power bank
U.S. only
Our Verdict 
Although a lower capacity than a separate power bank, having the battery pack built into a protective case means you don’t have to remember to carry another device with you, and functions both to protect your phone from drops and knocks and from loss of power.

**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
When specifically tailored queries made to test Apple Intelligence using developer tools are intentionally ambiguous about race and gender, researchers have seen biases pop up.


Examples of notification summaries on an iPhone
AI Forensics, a German nonprofit, analyzed over 10,000 notification summaries created by Apple's AI feature. The report suggests that Apple Intelligence treats White people as the "default" while applying gender stereotypes when no gender has been specified.
According to the report, Apple Intelligence has a tendency to ignore a person's ethnicity if they are caucasian.

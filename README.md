**Source:** AppleInsider | **Tags:** `Mac` `Apple` `Hardware`
A new report is claiming that stocks of both the iPhone 16e and the iPad Air are dwindling at retail, perhaps backing up expectations of new models being launched soon.


The current iPhone 16e
There are regularly reports of stocks of Apple devices running low, and the presumption is often that this means a refresh is coming. As of late it hasn't been the case — reports of MacBook Pro custom configuration stock-outs have been prevalent for months, and the Apple TV hardware is subject to the same from time to time.

While most iPhone users rush to download the latest iOS update to check out all the new features, the latest one released this week doesn’t really have any. So it could be tempting to wait a few weeks. But there are a few dozen reasons not to do that.
It’s common for nearly every iOS and iPadOS release to contain at least a few security updates. Apple works diligently to close every loophole and fix every flaw that could let a malicious actor get access to your device and data. iOS and iPadOS 26.3 have more than 35 security patches, according to Apple’s security updates page.

When Apple launched the Apple Creator Studio (ACS) subscription, the company indicated that you could use the AI features to produce 50 Keynote presentations per month “as a minimum.” However, developer and security researcher Steve Troughton-Smith had a very different experience when it came to AI usage limits.
He reported that far from being able to produce 50 presentations, a single Keynote slideshow used half of his monthly ACS limit, so the limit would be just two …

For the past decade, my Apple Time Capsule has faithfully backed up my Mac. I’ve been through several upgrades over the past decade—my current machine is an M3 Max MacBook Pro—and I’ve never had an issue with my Time Capsule. It’s been one of the most reliable devices I’ve ever owned, and I’ve barely had to even think about it since I bought it in 2016.
Until recently, that is. I don’t know the exact date, but I installed macOS Tahoe 26.2 sometime near the end of 2025.

If you want to unblock regional content on streaming services like Netflix, iPlayer, and Prime, or access websites that aren’t available in your region, or without ID, a VPN is an essential tool. A good VPN will work with all your Apple devices, including a Mac, iPad, iPhone, and even an Apple TV in some cases.
VPN services can also give you online privacy as well as letting you securely connect to open Wi-Fi networks in cafes, hotels, airports and other places. It’s something well worth packing when you go on vacation.

Apple just can’t seem to get its new Siri off the ground. A new report from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg says that testing of the big Siri overhaul due in iOS 26.4 (soon to enter beta, with a release planned for March) will instead be spread out over the rest of the year. At this point, it’s hard to have confidence that important planned features won’t be delayed further.
Gurman’s sources tell him that testing has “run into snags in recent weeks” and that some of the features will be delayed to iOS 26.5 (due in May) or iOS 27 (due in September).
